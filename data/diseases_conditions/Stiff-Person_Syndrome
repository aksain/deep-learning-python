<p><b><a name="what_is_stiff-person_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stiff-person syndrome (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sodium_polystyrene_sulfonate-oral_suspension/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">SPS</a>) is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_stiff-person_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stiff-Person syndrome is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">muscle spasms</a>. Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder. People with Stiff-Person syndrome can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls. </p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_affected_by_and_what_causes_stiff-person_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stiff-Person syndrome affects twice as many women as men. It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroiditis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroiditis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitiligo/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitiligo</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pernicious_anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pernicious anemia</a>. Scientists don't yet understand what causes Stiff-Person syndrome, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_stiff-person_syndrome_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The disorder is often misdiagnosed as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fibromyalgia</a>, psychosomatic illness, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias_picture_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">phobia</a>. A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">GAD</a>) antibodies in the blood. People with Stiff-Person syndrome have elevated levels of GAD, an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_treatment_for_stiff-person_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with Stiff-Person syndrome respond to high doses of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diazepam/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diazepam</a> and several anti-convulsants, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gabapentin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gabapentin</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tiagabine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tiagabine</a>. A study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> in people with Stiff-Person syndrome. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_stiff-person_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment with IVIg, anti-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> relievers will improve the symptoms of Stiff-Person syndrome, but will not cure the disorder. Most individuals with Stiff-Person syndrome have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe. With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_research_is_being_done_for_stiff-person_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Stroke</a> (NINDS) conducts research related to Stiff-Person syndrome in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. A study using the drug <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rituximab/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rituximab</a> proved ineffective in treating individuals with the disorder. Current research is focused on understanding the cause of the disease and the role of the anti-GAD antibodies. <span id="cntid"></span></p>
