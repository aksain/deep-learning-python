process only takes a few minutes. There may be mild discomfort when the sample 
is taken. After the test you may have mild cramping and bleeding, and you should 
rest the day of the procedure. You may be asked to abstain from sex and vigorous 
activity for a few days after the test. You should contact your doctor if you

vagina after the test.</p>.<p>After the sample is removed, the cells are cultured in a laboratory and 
analyzed. It typically takes 7 to 10 days before results are available.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_benefits_and_risks_of_cvs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A major benefit of CVS is that it can be performed earlier in the pregnancy 
than amniocentesis, providing information about genetic defects earlier in the 
pregnancy. If a woman chooses termination of pregnancy, it is safer at earlier

100 cases. The risk of miscarriage can be slightly greater than the risk of 
miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. Rarely, defects in the fingers or 
toes of the fetus have been reported with CVS, but these cases were particularly 
common when CVS was done very early in pregnancy, before 9 weeks' gestation. 
For this reason, most cases of CVS are performed only at or after 10 weeks' 
gestation. Infection is another uncommon complication of CVS.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_should_receive_cvs_testing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>CVS testing is generally offered to women or couples who have one of the following:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_counseling/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Genetic counseling</a> and a full discussion of the risks and benefits of the procedure are recommended before undergoing CVS testing.</p>.<p>Some women should not receive CVS testing.
