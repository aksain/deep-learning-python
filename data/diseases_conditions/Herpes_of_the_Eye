The virus settles in the body's nervous system, where it remains in its latent, dormant state.

Special eye examination equipment allows a much more detailed assessment, and physicians can tailor the treatment plan to the degree and extent of eye involvement.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_herpes_eye_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most of the time, physicians make the diagnosis based on the symptoms and the signs alone.</p>.<p>Herpes keratitis typically produces a distinct erosion of the outer layer of the cornea (a "dendrite"), which has a tree-branching pattern that can be seen by the examiner using a blue light and an eyedrop containing a dye. Under a slit-lamp microscope, the eye doctor can look for further clues to distinguish between a HSV and a HZV keratitis, but in either case, the initial antiviral treatment is the same.</p>.<p>Health care professionals perform a close examination of the other eye tissues (including the skin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctiva</a>, anterior chamber, iris, retina, and more) to assess the extent of the infection. In questionable cases, doctors obtain a culture to confirm the diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatment_options_for_herpes_eye_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Initial treatment is with either topical (drop) or oral antiviral medication. In certain less common cases, intravenous medication is also necessary.</p>.<p>The antiviral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> currently available work by suppressing the reproduction of the virus, thus reducing the number of active viruses. This may shorten the duration and severity of the infection and possibly reduce the odds of a recurrence.</p>.<p>Unfortunately, there is still no antiviral medication that "cures" one of herpes. The herpes viruses reside in the cells in our nervous system where they remain inactive and quiet ("latent") for months or years. No treatment has been developed to date that can eradicate the viruses in their latent state.</p>.<p>When the virus becomes "active" for whatever reason, it begins reproducing and its progeny virus travel along a nerve to the site of the infection (at the skin or cornea). The antiviral medications available today only affect these actively replicating viruses, not the latent viruses in the nervous system.</p>.<p>In addition to antiviral medications, patients may use antibiotic drops or ointment as a preventative measure to reduce their chances of a bacterial infection developing in the area of viral infection. This is because an eroded cornea becomes more vulnerable to a secondary bacterial infection.</p>.<p>The eye pressure (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">intraocular pressure</a>) can rise due to internal swelling (inflammation) of the eye or direct herpes virus infection of the trabecular meshwork (the internal drainage channels within the eye). If so, doctors will prescribe a pressure-lowering medication.</p>.<p>Herpes affecting the middle layer of the cornea (herpetic stromal keratitis), back layer of the cornea (herpetic endotheliitis), and iris (herpetic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">iritis</a>) are associated with significant inflammation. Inflammation of any of the tissues of the eye may require anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids. In some cases, the inflammation is chronic or recurring, requiring several rounds of steroid treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_possible_risks_and_complications_of_untreated_herpes_eye_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the worst-case scenario, untreated herpes eye infections lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic pain</a>, and loss of the eye. Aggressive treatment aims to reduce the chances of scarring, eye pressure problems, and direct damage to the eye tissues.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_herpes_eye_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most herpes simplex keratitis (HSV eye infections) are limited to the outer layer of the cornea and resolve within a couple of weeks with antiviral therapy, leaving little or no permanent damage. HSV infections of the deeper tissue layers may have a higher complication rate due to inflammation.</p>.<p>HZV and shingles involving the outer layer of the cornea may also resolve over a couple of weeks with antiviral therapy. However, it is common for a painful burning sensation to linger in the area of the skin rash for months or even years. This is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/postherpetic_neuralgia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">postherpetic neuralgia</a> and sometimes requires treatments for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> control. Both types of herpes eye infections can leave residual corneal scarring that can blur the vision. In some cases, it's possible to correct this with surgery.</p>.<p>Damage to the corneal nerves can also lead to chronic numbness of the cornea, causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dry eye</a> and, in advanced cases, predisposing to dry-eye related corneal erosions or ulcers. In these cases lubricating drops, punctal plugs, and sometimes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blepharoplasty__eyelid_surgery/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">eyelid surgery</a> may help protect the cornea.</p>.<p>Unfortunately, both HSV and HZV ophthalmicus can recur with unpredictable frequency in either eye. Frequent recurrences should warrant a general medical checkup to rule out any underlying condition that may be weakening the immune system. However, in many cases, it is the virulence of the particular virus strain that determines its activity level.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_herpes_eye_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For patients with frequent recurrences of herpes eye infections, taking a low-dose antiviral drug on a daily basis can reduce the frequency of recurrences in some cases. Your eye doctor will help determine if this is a safe option.</p>.<p>There is no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> against HSV at this time. There is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/varicella_virus_vaccine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vaccine against chickenpox</a> for babies and toddlers (varicella vaccine). A zoster vaccine (approved for adults 50 years of age and over) may reduce the frequency and severity of shingles and HZV eye disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all adults aged 60 and over receive this vaccine but does not recommend vaccination of those aged 50-59. Research is ongoing to develop a means of eradicating the viruses in their latent states.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
