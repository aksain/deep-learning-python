<p>The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red blood cells</a>. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.</p>.<p>The hematocrit is typically measured from a blood sample by an automated machine that makes several other measurements of the blood at the same time. Most of these machines in fact do not directly measure the hematocrit, but instead calculate it based on the determination of the amount of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemoglobin</a> and the average volume of the red blood cells. The hematocrit can also be determined by a manual method using a centrifuge. When a tube of blood is centrifuged, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red cells</a> will be packed into the bottom of the tube. The proportion of red cells to the total blood volume can then be visually measured.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The normal ranges for hematocrit are depend on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are:</p>.<p>These values may vary slightly among different laboratories.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>A person who has a low hematocrit is referred to as being <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">anemic</a>. There are many reasons for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>. Some of the more common reasons are loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">colon cancer</a>), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, suppression by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a>), and abnormal hemoglobin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sickle cell anemia</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Higher than normal hematocrit levels represent abnormally elevated red blood cell counts. High hematocrits can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smokers</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Dehydration</a> produces a falsely high hematocrit that disappears when proper fluid balance is restored.
