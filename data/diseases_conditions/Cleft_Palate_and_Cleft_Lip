midline (center) or left and/or right side of the lip. A cleft palate is an 
opening of the hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth) or 
the soft palate (the muscular non-bony region in the rear of the roof of the 
mouth. Similar to a cleft lip, a cleft palate may be midline and/or to either 
right of left side of the palate. A cleft palate may extend from the upper 
jawbone to the rear of the throat. </p>.<p>Since development of the lip and palate occur at different times during 
gestation, an infant may have either a cleft lip or cleft palate or clefting of 
both regions. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_often_do_these_birth_effects_occur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cleft lip, either as a sole malformation or coupled with cleft palate occur in approximately one in 700 live births. Boys are twice as likely to have a cleft lip with or without an associated cleft palate. On the other hand, girls are more likely to have a cleft palate alone (those not associated with a cleft lip malformation). Ethnic background has been shown to affect the frequency of clefts. Children of Asian, Latino, or Native American ancestry are more frequently affected when compared to those of Caucasian background.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the__causes_and_risk_factors_for_developing_a_cleft_lip_and_cleft_palate" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While gender and ethnic background are risk factors, as described above, 
there are other factors that seem to play a role in causing clefting. 
Specialists have noted that the more severe the defect in a child the higher the 
risk for a cleft malformation in subsequent siblings. The recurrence risk for a 
cleft deformity is 2.7% if an older sibling has a single cleft lip. If an older 
sibling has bilateral (both sides of the upper lip) involvement, the recurrence 
risk is doubled (5.4%). If a parent has had either cleft lip or palate, there 
exists a 4% likelihood of cleft malformation in their children. However, if an 
affected parent has a child with cleft lip or palate, the chance of future 
children experiencing a cleft malformation rises to 14%. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_a_cleft_lip_and_cleft_palate" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of cleft lip at birth is obvious. All <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">newborn</a> infants are screened at birth for cleft palate. Direct illuminated examination of the infant's hard and soft palate is part of the complete exam of any newborn. In addition, the palate (both hard and soft regions) are palpated with the examiner's finger to ensure that a "partial cleft" is not missed. Partial clefting occurs when a bony or muscular defect of the palate are obscured by intact skin covering the tissue separation (similar to covering a hole in beach sand with a towel).</p>.<p>Prior to birth, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prenatal_ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">prenatal ultrasound</a> examination may demonstrate malformation of the upper lip, nasal opening, or palate. Since as many as 35% of conceptions with cleft lip and palate may be associated with other non-oral cavity deformities, specialized ultrasounds may be indicated. Similarly, the obstetrician may recommend blood tests and an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amniocentesis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">amniocentesis</a>.

requires patience by both the parents and ultimately the patient. Several years 
of multiple surgical procedures are generally necessary to provide a 
satisfactory outcome. The repair of a cleft lip is usually addressed at 
approximately 3 months of age. One or two surgical procedures may be necessary 
to achieve both effective lip function and cosmetic repair. Cleft palate repair 
is a multistep series of surgical procedures starting at about 6 to 12 months of 
age and finalized in the later teen years. The first procedure is typically 
repair of the defect in the palate, which allows better feeding and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight gain</a> 
and reduces the frequency of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hearing_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing loss</a> and recurrent ear infections. Repair 
of the palate defect also encourages appropriate development of the upper jaw 
(maxilla) and other facial bones. At approximately 8 years of age, a bone graft 
is performed to further support the upper jaw structure and aid in speech 
articulation. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_braces/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Braces</a> are generally required to straighten permanent teeth and

appearance and function can be achieved. In order to maximize the medical 
management as well as coordination with multiple health-care professionals and 
parents, a cleft palate team is generally the preferred approach to coordination 
of care. Such teams are commonly found at pediatric teaching hospitals in major
