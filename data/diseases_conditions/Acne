It is not caused by bacteria, although bacteria play a role in its development. It is not unusual for some women to develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/acne_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">acne</a> in their mid- to late-20s.</p>.<p>Acne appears on the skin as</p>.<p>One can do a lot to treat acne using products available at a drugstore or cosmetic counter that do not require a prescription. However, for tougher cases of acne, one should consult a physician for treatment options.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_acne" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No one factor causes acne. Acne occurs when sebaceous (oil) glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated at the time of puberty or due to other hormonal changes. Sebum (oil) is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin. Associated with increased oil production is a change in the manner in which the skin cells mature, predisposing them to plug the follicular pore. The plug can appear as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adult_acne_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">whitehead</a> if it is covered by a thin layer of skin, or if exposed to the air, the darker exposed portion of the plug is called a "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adult_acne_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">blackhead</a>." The plugged <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">hair follicle</a> gradually enlarges, producing a bump. As the follicle enlarges, the wall may rupture, allowing irritating substances and normal skin bacteria access into the deeper layers of the skin, ultimately producing inflammation. Inflammation near the skin's surface produces a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pustule</a>; deeper inflammation results in a papule (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adult_acne_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pimple</a>); if the inflammation is deeper still, it forms a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cyst</a>.</p>.<p>Here are some factors that don't usually play a role in acne:</p>.<p>In occasional patients, the following may be contributing factors:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_skin_conditions_can_mimic_acne_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_someone_start_acne_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since everyone gets acne at some time, the right time to treat it is when it becomes bothersome or when the potential for scarring develops. This can be when severe acne flares suddenly, for mild acne that just won't go away, or even when a single pimple decides to show up the week before one's prom or wedding.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_people_do_to_get_rid_of_their_acne" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Moderation and regularity are good things, but not everyone can <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> eight hours, eat three healthy meals per day, and drink plenty of water a day. Probably the most useful lifestyle changes one can make is to <i>never</i> to pick or squeeze pimples. Playing with or popping pimples, no matter how careful and clean one is, nearly always makes bumps stay redder and bumpier longer. People often refer to redness as "scarring," but fortunately, it usually isn't permanent. It's just a mark that takes months to fade if left entirely alone.</p>.<p>Occasional visits to an esthetician who is an expert at safely removing blackheads during a facial can be beneficial.</p>.<p>Despite what one might read in popular style and fashion magazines, there is no magic product or regimen that is right for every person and situation.</p>.<p>Benzoyl peroxide causes red and scaly skin irritation in a small number of people, which goes away as soon as one stops using the product. Keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide is a bleach, so do not let products containing benzoyl peroxide come into contact with fabrics, leaving unsightly white spots on colored clothes, shirts, towels, and carpets.</p>.<p>One cannot stop oil glands from producing oil. Even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/isotretinoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">isotretinoin</a> (Accutane, see below) only slows down oil glands for a while; they resume normal activity later.

The goal of treatment should be the prevention of scarring (not a flawless complexion) so that after the condition spontaneously resolves there is no lasting sign of the affliction. Here are some of the options available:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_would_you_summarize_current-day_acne_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treating acne requires patience and perseverance. Any of the treatments listed above may take two or three months to start working (even isotretinoin). Unless there are side effects such as excessive dryness or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>, it is important to give each regimen or drug enough time to work before giving up on it and moving on to other methods.
