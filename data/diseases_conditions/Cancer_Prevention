By preventing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.</p>.<p>Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related diseases. Many things in our genes, our lifestyle, and the environment around us may increase or decrease our risk of getting cancer.</p>.<p>Scientists are studying many different ways to help prevent cancer, including the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="carcinogenesis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Carcinogenesis is the process in which normal cells turn into cancer cells.</b></p>.<p>Carcinogenesis is the series of steps that take place as a normal cell becomes a cancer cell. Cells are the smallest units of the body and they make up the body's tissues. Each cell contains genes that guide the way the body grows, develops, and repairs itself. There are many genes that control whether a cell lives or dies, divides (multiplies), or takes on special functions, such as becoming a nerve cell or a muscle cell.</p>.<p><b>Changes (mutations) in genes occur during carcinogenesis.</b></p>.<p>Changes (mutations) in genes can cause normal controls in cells to break down. When this happens, cells do not die when they should and new cells are produced when the body does not need them. The buildup of extra cells may cause a mass (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a>) to form.</p>.<p>Tumors can be benign or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">malignant</a> (cancerous). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Malignant tumor</a> cells invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumor cells do not invade nearby tissues or spread.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Scientists study risk factors and protective factors to find ways to prevent new cancers from starting. Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor.

</p>.<p>Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For example, both <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> and inheriting certain genes are risk factors for some types of cancer, but only <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> can be avoided. Risk factors that a person can control are called modifiable risk factors.

</p>.<p>Many other factors in our environment, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, and lifestyle may cause or prevent cancer. This summary reviews only the major <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_causes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer risk factors</a> and protective factors that can be controlled or changed to reduce the risk of cancer. Risk factors that are not described in the summary include certain sexual behaviors, the use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogen</a>, and being exposed to certain substances at work or to certain chemicals.</p>.<p><b><a name="factors_that_are_Known_to_Increase_the_Risk_of_Cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Cigarette Smoking and Tobacco Use</b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tobacco</a> use is strongly linked to an increased risk for many kinds of cancer. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Smoking</a> cigarettes is the leading cause of the following types of cancer:

</p>.<p>Not smoking or quitting smoking lowers the risk of getting cancer and dying from cancer. Scientists believe that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cigarette</a> smoking causes about 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States.

</p>.<p><b>Infections</b></p>.<p>Certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> and bacteria are able to cause cancer. Viruses and other infection-causing agents cause more cases of cancer in the developing world (about 1 in 4 cases of cancer) than in developed nations (less than 1 in 10 cases of cancer). Examples of cancer-causing viruses and bacteria include:</p>.<p>Two vaccines to prevent infection by cancer-causing agents have already been developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One is a vaccine to prevent infection with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hepatitis_b_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis B</a> virus. The other protects against infection with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strains</a> of human papillomavirus (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a>) that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cervical cancer</a>. Scientists continue to work on vaccines against infections that cause cancer.</p>.<p><b>Radiation</b></p>.<p>Being exposed to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> is a known cause of cancer. There are two main types of radiation linked with an increased risk for cancer:</p>.<p>Scientists believe that ionizing radiation causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">leukemia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid cancer</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a> in women. Ionizing radiation may also be linked to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_myeloma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">myeloma</a> and cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a>, bladder, and ovary. Being exposed to radiation from diagnostic x-rays increases the risk of cancer in patients and x-ray technicians.</p>.<p>The risk of cancer after being exposed to ionizing radiation from diagnostic x-rays is higher for younger age groups than for older age groups, and is higher for women than for men. The risk of cancer also increases with the number of diagnostic x-rays a patient is given and the radiation dose per x-ray.</p>.<p><b>Immunosuppressive Medicines</b></p>.<p>Immunosuppressive medicines are linked to an increased risk of cancer. These medicines lower the body's ability to stop cancer from forming. For example, immunosuppressive medicines may be used to keep a patient from rejecting an organ transplant.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="factors_that_may_affect_the_Risk_of_Cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Diet</b></p>.<p>The foods that you eat on a regular basis make up your diet. Diet is being studied as a risk factor for cancer. It is hard to study the effects of diet on cancer because a person's diet includes foods that may protect against cancer and foods that may increase the risk of cancer.</p>.<p>It is also hard for people who take part in the studies to keep track of what they eat over a long period of time. This may explain why studies have different results about how diet affects the risk of cancer.</p>.<p>Some studies show that fruits and nonstarchy vegetables may protect against cancers of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach. Fruits may also protect against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lung cancer</a>.</p>.<p>Some studies have shown that a diet high in fat, proteins, calories, and red meat increases the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colorectal cancer</a>, but other studies have not shown this.</p>.<p>It is not known if a diet low in fat and high in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fiber</a>, fruits, and vegetables lowers the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colorectal cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b>Alcohol</b></p>.<p>Studies have shown that drinking alcohol is linked to an increased risk of the following types of cancers:</p>.<p>Drinking alcohol may also increase the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> cancer and female colorectal cancer.</p>.<p><b>Physical Activity</b></p>.<p>Studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of certain cancers than those who are not. It is not known if physical activity itself is the reason for this.</p>.<p>Studies show a strong link between physical activity and a lower risk of colorectal cancer.

Many studies are being done to find ways to keep cancer from starting or recurring (coming back).</p>.<p><b>Chemoprevention is being studied in patients who have a high risk of developing cancer.</b></p>.<p>Chemoprevention is the use of substances to lower the risk of cancer, or keep it from recurring. The substances may be natural or made in the laboratory. Some chemopreventive agents are tested in people who are at high risk for a certain type of cancer. The risk may be because of a precancerous condition, family history, or lifestyle factors.</p>.<p>Some chemoprevention studies have shown good results.
