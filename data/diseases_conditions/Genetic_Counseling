Universities and medical centers also often have affiliated genetic

medical researcher - who specializes in your disease or disorder. A medical 
geneticist has completed a fellowship or has other advanced training in medical 
genetics. While a genetic counselor or 
genetic nurse may help you with testing decisions and support issues, a medical 
geneticist will make the actual diagnosis of a disease or condition. Many genetic diseases are so rare that only 
a geneticist can provide the most complete and current information about your 
condition.</p>.<p>Along with a medical geneticist, you may also be 
referred to a physician who is a specialist in the type of disorder you have.
