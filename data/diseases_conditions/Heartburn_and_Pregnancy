<p><b><a name="heartburn_during_pregnancy_definitions_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_heartburn_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of heartburn (also called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) during pregnancy is more complicated than in the non-pregnant state. The basic cause of heartburn - reflux of acid from the stomach into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> - is the same. The lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus that normally prevents acid from refluxing) is weak in pregnancy. This probably is an effect of the high levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">estrogens</a> and progesterones that are a normal part of pregnancy. This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a> resolves after delivery.</p>.<p>It is not known whether unexplained, transient relaxations of the sphincter, a common cause of reflux in the non-pregnant state, also occur in pregnancy. It also is not known if the contraction (motility) of the esophagus above the sphincter, a common contributor to GERD in the non-pregnant state, is impaired in pregnancy and is responsible for delaying the clearance of acid from the esophagus back into the stomach. What makes pregnancy different is the distortion of the organs in the abdomen and the increased abdominal pressure caused by the growing fetus. These changes clearly promote the reflux of acid.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="which_diet_and_lifestyle_changes_relieve_heartburn_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The management of heartburn (GERD) during pregnancy involves many of the same principles as management in the non-pregnant state. Lifestyle changes may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="which_hearburn_medications_are_used_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If lifestyle changes are not adequate, treatments with substances that are minimally absorbed into the body (and therefore not a potential threat to the fetus) could be started. Treatments include antacids (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aluminum_hydroxide_magnesium_hydroxide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Maalox</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/simethicone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Mylanta</a>), alginic acid/antacid combination (Gaviscon), and sucralfate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sucralfate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Carafate</a>). The most reasonable first line of treatment is antacids alone, one hour after meals and at bedtime. It may be necessary to alternate magnesium and aluminum-containing antacids to avoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a>. If antacids alone are not effective, then they should be continued and alginic acid/antacid may be added. Antacids and alginic acid/antacid should be taken after meals and at bedtime, more frequently if necessary, as advised by your doctor.</p>.<p>Sucralfate acts by coating and protecting the lining of the esophagus and stomach and is more effective in an acidic environment. Thus, if sucralfate is being used, it should be taken one-half hour before or after doses of antacids or alginic acid/antacid for maximal effect. A small study in pregnant women showed sucralfate is successful in relieving heartburn and studies in animals have not shown effects of sucralfate on the fetus.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_heartburn_drugs_safe_to_take_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
