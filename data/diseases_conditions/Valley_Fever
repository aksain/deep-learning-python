<p><b><a name="valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) is a disease caused by fungi (<i>Coccidioides immitis</i> and <i>C. posadasii</i> species) that in about 50%-75% of normal (not immunocompromised) people causes either no symptoms or mild symptoms and those infected never seek medical care. When symptoms are more pronounced, they usually present as lung problems (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cold_flu_cough_relief_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cough</a>, shortness of breath, sputum production, fever, and chest pains). The disease can progress to chronic or progressive lung disease and may even become disseminated to the skin, lining tissue of the brain (meninges), skeleton, and other body areas. The disease can also infect many animal types (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puppies_and_dogs_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">dogs</a>, cattle, otters, and monkeys). From 1998 to 2011, the U.S. incidence has increased about tenfold to about 22,000 diagnosed individuals per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Prevention</a> (CDC) although some researchers estimate as many as 15,000 per year.</p>.<p>Most microbiologists and infectious disease physicians prefer the name <i>coccidioidomycosis</i> because the word describes the disease as a specific fungal disease, and this term may replace <i>valley fever</i> in the future. This disease has several commonly used names (valley fever, San Joaquin Valley fever, California valley fever, acute valley fever, and desert fever). Other names get confused with valley fever (for example, rift or African valley fever, which is caused by a virus).</p>.<p>Coccidioidomycosis was first noted in the 1890s in Argentina when tissue biopsies of people with the disease showed pathogens that resembled coccidia (protozoa). During 1896-1900, investigators learned the disease was caused by a fungus, not protozoa, so the term "mycosis" was eventually added to "coccidia." The disease is often noted to occur in outbreaks, usually when soil is disturbed and dust arises, and when groups of people visit an endemic region (such as San Joaquin Valley or Bakersfield [in Kern County], Calif., and Tucson, Ariz., or parts of southern New Mexico or west Texas) during late summer and early fall. The disease is not transmitted from person to person; it is acquired from the environment via contaminated soil and dust. About 150,000 individuals are estimated to become infected each year in the U.S.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Coccidioidomycosis is caused by two species of fungi, <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> and 
<i>Coccidioides posadasii</i>. Both are dimorphic (having mycelial and spore phases when viewed microscopically) and almost always are acquired through the respiratory tract by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inhalation</a>. When viewed microscopically, the mycelial form found in the soil has arthroconidia (barrel-shaped asexual spores) attached to non-spore-forming rectangular mycelium cells, usually alternating in a line. Once the arthroconidia are inhaled, the fungus develops into 30-60 micron diameter structures called spherules that are filled with 3-5 micron diameter endospores. The large spherules then release the endospores that continue the infection; microscopic identification of these endospores in pus or tissue confirms the diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>About 60% of all infected people (without immunosuppression) have no symptoms and do not seek medical care. About 30%-35% of people who develop symptoms have flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, malaise, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chills</a>) that resolve over about two to six weeks without treatment. Some may develop additional symptoms such as shortness of breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/night_sweats/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">night sweats</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a>, sputum production, and joint and muscle pains (symptoms resembling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a>). Women, more often than men, may develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erythema_nodosum/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">erythema nodosum</a> (reddish, painful, tender lumps, usually on the legs) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/erythema_multiforme_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">erythema multiforme</a> (an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergic reaction</a> similar to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/erythema_nodosum_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">erythema nodosum</a> in multiple body sites with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>). The combination of fever, erythema nodosum, and migratory joint pains are often referred to as "desert rheumatism." Usually these symptoms resolve in about two to six weeks.</p>.<p>Chronic coccidioidomycosis occurs in about 8% of patients and is characterized by the above symptoms but may spread from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> to other parts of the body. People develop lung <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cavities</a> that may disappear in about two years or become calcified.</p>.<p>Progressive pulmonary coccidioidomycosis includes the above symptoms but progresses to lung volume loss, fibrosis (scarring), and inflammation, considered serious complications of the disease.</p>.<p>Disseminated coccidioidomycosis (about 1% of cases) can be characterized by the above symptoms, but they may occur over weeks to years. The fungi may be found in any organ system but are most frequently seen in the skin, meninges, and bones. In a few individuals, the disease is rapidly fatal. Disseminated disease occurs most often in immunosuppressed individuals, males, and pregnant females.</p>.<p>Other mammals, like dogs, can become infected. As many as 28% of dogs by the age of 2 years may have had the disease, with about 6% showing symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/decreased_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">decreased appetite</a>, and listlessness. The animals are not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> to each other or humans, but like in some humans, the disease may progress.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis_%0Adiagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Early in the disease, the diagnosis is difficult because the symptoms may be 
mild so no tests are initiated.
Accurate diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is important because there are many 
diseases that have similar initial symptoms and may occur in areas of the world 
where coccidioidomycosis occurs; for example, Andes virus (caused by a 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hantavirus_pulmonary_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hantavirus</a>), arbovirus encephalitis (caused by six different <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a>), Argentine 
hemorrhagic fever (an arenavirus infection caused by Junin virus), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cryptococcosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cryptococcosis</a> (caused by <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, a fungal species), and 
others. Fortunately, a confirmative diagnostic test is easily done by 
microscopic examination of sputum or a tissue biopsy. The biopsy shows characteristic 
fungal spherules and endospores of <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> or <i>Coccidioides posadasii</i>. These fungi can also be identified after they are cultured on fungal 
media (growth takes about five days). Additionally, there are several serum tests 
and a 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">PCR</a> test (to detect the genetic material of the fungus) that are 
available. High blood levels of IgG (an immunoglobulin) that react with the 
fungi can help determine the extent of the disease. Skin tests can determine if 
the person has been exposed to the fungi, but the test is not very specific or 
sensitive.</p>.<p>
Other tests help determine the extent of the disease. The most frequent test is 
a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest X-ray</a> to identify abnormalities in the lungs. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a> and 
CT scans are used 
to examine brain or other organ (especially bone) involvement. Bone scans also 
help to determine the presence of bone involvement. Most physicians will do 
other routine blood tests such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CBC</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">complete blood count</a>) and ESR 
(erythrocyte <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sedimentation rate</a>, a marker of inflammation) test.</p>.<p>
Occasionally, the diagnosis may require obtaining samples of tissue or tissue 
fluid, so <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lumbar_puncture/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lumbar puncture</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bronchoscopy</a>, and surgical or needle biopsy may be 
done.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of cases (over 60%) spontaneously resolves and requires no treatment. However, there are several antifungal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> available to treat coccidioidomycosis if needed. The drug of choice is usually amphotericin B, but oral azoles (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">fluconazole</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Diflucan</a>], <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itraconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">itraconazole</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itraconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sporanox</a>], and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketoconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ketoconazole</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketoconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Nizoral</a>]). Newer antifungal agents including posaconazole and voriconazole are often used "off label," meaning they have not been approved to treat coccidioidomycosis. Most of these drugs have side effects, and most have not been proven safe to use in pregnant patients except for amphotericin B. High relapse rates can occur with some patients (about 75% relapse with brain involvement), requiring lifelong antifungal therapy. In general, dosage (especially pediatric), length of time of drug administration, and the choice of drug is best decided in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.</p>.<p>Surgical treatment is sometimes needed. Pulmonary cavities, persistent pulmonary infection, empyema (pus collection), and shunt placement are some of the surgical interventions used to treat this disease.</p>.<p>Other treatments (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Deltasone</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Liquid Pred</a>] or alternative therapy such as dietary modification) are not currently recommended by most physicians; people should consult with their physician before trying to use such methods.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_outcome_for_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of people who get infected with the<i> Coccidioides</i> fungi have a good prognosis, as the infection is usually self-limiting. Some people with self-limiting disease may get a few small calcified areas in the lung, but these typically cause no problems for the person. Chronic disease may produce more nodules and cavities in the lung and take a year or two to resolve, but usually the prognosis is good for many patients.</p>.<p>However, people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> or the elderly have a only fair prognosis, as they can develop progressive pulmonary disease with symptoms (shortness of breath, lung fibrosis, and cavities in the lungs) that persist for years. Progressive coccidioidomycosis has a poor prognosis. About 1% of patients are at high risk (usually those who are immunosuppressed due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a>) for developing disseminated coccidioidomycosis, and these patients have a grave prognosis. Patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis can have rapid development of all the symptoms listed above and die if the disease is not appropriately and rapidly treated.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_developing_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People living in the endemic areas (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) have been estimated to have a 1 in 33 chance of acquiring the disease every year (others have even higher risk, see below for Kern County, Calif.), so the chance increases (accumulates) the longer they reside in the area. However, even people simply passing through the area can get the disease. Males and pregnant females have a higher risk of getting the disease. People who do construction or farm work, especially the type that disturbs the soil, and any immunosuppressed person has an increased risk of developing valley fever (coccidioidomycosis). Poor air quality in the endemic areas also increases risk for the disease. Inmates (58 individuals) in California are suing the state because they allege the contracted the disease while serving prison time.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Research is progressing at several laboratories, but to date there is no vaccine 
available to prevent coccidioidomycosis in humans. People who live in endemic 
areas (see map in the last Web citation) of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Texas are likely to be exposed to the organisms since they occur in soil and 
dust. People who are more susceptible to the disease (for example, 
immunosuppressed people such as those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV/AIDS</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, the elderly, and 
pregnant females) should avoid new construction sites and stay indoors on dusty 
days. Soil in these areas can be moistened to prevent dust formation, and some 
investigators suggest that susceptible people should wear dust masks if dust 
exposure is likely. People who get the disease usually develop immunity to it, 
and unless their immune system is compromised, will not get the disease again.
</p>.<p><b><a name="is_valley_fever_coccidioidomycosis_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Valley fever is not contagious person to person. People only become infected when they inhale arthroconidia (spores) of <i>Coccidioides</i> that settle in the lungs. Spores are easily dispersed and become airborne mixed with dust, especially on dusty, windy days and in areas where soil has been recently disturbed by construction or similar actions.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_one_find_more_information_on_valley_fever" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In California, Kern County developed a web site in 2013 devoted to valley fever because it is endemic.
