<p><b><a name="asthma_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Asthma</a> is a disease in which there is a brief, temporary narrowing of the airways in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, referred to as bronchospasm. This is only part of the picture. The main problem in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthma</a> involves inflammation and swelling of the airways. It is important to understand that the lungs have a series of tubes akin to branches of tree leading to each of the air sacs of the lungs. When these tubes become inflamed, the walls thicken and the opening of the tube narrows. This causes increased resistance for air flow. In addition, these changes make it easier for bronchospasm to occur. Both bronchospasm and thickened <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">airway</a> walls prevent air from moving in and out of the lungs easily. As a result, a patient with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">asthma</a> has episodic difficulty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a>. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthmatic</a> episode can resolve spontaneously or may require treatment.</p>.<p>It is crucial to understand that over time the airway inflammation associated with asthma can result in permanent remodeling/scarring of the airways. When this occurs and lung function no longer returns normal when not having an attack, Asthma moves into the category of disease known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">COPD</a>). Therefore, if persistent symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tightness_in_chest/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chest tightness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wheezing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">wheezing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shortness of breath</a> occur, it is imperative to be evaluated by a physician. Even mild symptoms, if long lasting, can reflect chronic inflammation and progress to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">COPD</a>. The available <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) medications treat bronchospasm primarily and have little, if any, effect on airway inflammation. It is not advisable to use over-the-counter asthma medication unless instructed by a physician knowledgeable in the treatment of asthma. Airway inflammation is treated by prescription medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/montelukast/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">montelukast</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/montelukast/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Singulair</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zafirlukast/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">zafirlukast</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zafirlukast/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Accolate</a>), and inhaled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroids</a> (steroids).</p>.<p>Asthmatic patients and their physicians may select from a wide variety of prescription medications. This is not true for OTC medicines, which are limited to epinephrine (adrenaline) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ephedrine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ephedrine</a>. In addition, many asthmatic patients should not use epinephrine or ephedrine because of their relatively weak effectiveness or side effects.</p>.<p>To decide whether an OTC epinephrine or ephedrine product may be useful, patients should understand:</p>.<p>The advantages of using OTC <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_medications/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">medications for asthma</a> include their affordability and accessibility (lack of need for a prescription and/or health insurance approval). Unfortunately, these medications are less effective at controlling asthma and sometimes can be more dangerous.</p>.<p>Recently, the FDA published safety concerns about the new medication Asthmanefrin and the EZ Breathe atomizer. They report complications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, increased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a>, increased heart rate, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bloody_sputum/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">coughing up blood</a>. Even more disconcerting, they have reports of a choking hazard from a washer dislodged during atomizer use.</p>.<p>Most pulmonary and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> specialists would discourage the use of these OTC medications unless <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">asthma symptoms</a> are extremely mild and infrequent.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of asthma is unknown. Physicians know more about the abnormal conditions that occur in asthma. These conditions include:</p>.<p>Each of these conditions narrow the airways and make breathing difficult. Asthma symptoms include wheezing (the hallmark of asthma), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a>, difficulty breathing, and tightness of the chest. Health care professionals diagnose asthma by the presence of wheezing, though wheezing can occur with other diseases, such as airway narrowing from other diseases, or excess fluid from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">congestive heart failure</a>. Other common symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cough</a> and shortness of breath, help determine if asthma is present. Breathing tests (spirometry) that evaluate the movement of air into and out of the lungs can be very helpful in making the diagnosis. Normally, one can exhale 70% of the air from the lungs in one second with a forced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">exhalation</a>. In asthma, this number is often reduced when a patient is having symptoms. When they are better, the volume of air exhaled in that first second (referred to as FEV1, forced expired volume in one second) often is normal. This reversibility also helps confirm the diagnosis. Often a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchodilators_for_asthma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">bronchodilator</a> is administered after initial testing to determine if the airways dilate, another confirmatory test. Some have a type of asthma referred to as cough variant asthma. In this situation, patients have a cough that is chronic or recurrent with the presence of normal lung function.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_treat_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prior to modern medicine, people smoked a variety of plants and herbs in an effort to treat asthma. Some were mildly efficacious, while others were just plain dangerous. Oral and inhaled forms of epinephrine and ephedrine once were the only effective medications for treating asthma. Beginning in the 1980s, newer medications were introduced that target more of the abnormal conditions in asthma and do so more effectively than epinephrine or ephedrine. For example, prescription inhaler forms of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA), including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/albuterol/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">albuterol</a> (Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levalbuterol-inhalation_solution/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Xopenex</a>), and metaproterenol (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metaproterenol-inhalation_solution/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Alupent</a>), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) including Beclovent, Flovent, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beclomethasone_dipropionate_inhaler/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Qvar</a>, Asmanex, Asmacort, Arnuity, Pulmicort, Aerospan, Alvesco and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flunisolide_nasal_spray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">AeroBid</a>, anticholinergics (ipratropium, tiotropium bromide, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glycopyrrolate-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">glycopyrrolate</a>, umeclidinium, [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ipratropium_bromide_inhaler/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Atrovent</a>], Spiriva, Incruse, Bevespi), and other medicines are now widely used because of their greater effectiveness and fewer side effects. The use of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications that include steroid agents such as fluticasone, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/budesonide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">budesonide</a>, beclomethasone, and flunisolide has become the mainstay of initial asthma therapy. Unfortunately, none of these medications is available without a prescription. Often, doctors prescribe these medications in combination with a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/salmeterol/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">salmeterol</a>, formoterol, or vilanterol. Some of the more common versions include Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, and Breo.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_over-the-counter_otc_asthma_medications_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Epinephrine acts by relaxing the muscles of the airways, thereby opening up the airways and allowing air to flow in and out of the lungs more easily. Ephedrine also relaxes the muscles of the airways. Essentially, these drugs work by stimulating the beta sympathetic receptors. However, these agents are not very specific and stimulate all beta receptors, resulting in increased side effects, including elevate blood pressure and heart rate.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_factors_should_%0Apatients_consider_in_choosing_and_using_otc_epinephrine_or_ephedrine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Despite the development of newer medications, epinephrine and ephedrine remain available as OTC medications. The choice of epinephrine or ephedrine should involve consideration of several factors. Most importantly, the asthma should be mild and less frequent, defined as occurring less than once per week and resolving almost immediately. It's best to use OTC epinephrine or ephedrine under the guidance of a physician, if used at all. A patient should seek medical attention and prepare to switch to a prescription asthma medication in most cases, but especially if:</p>.<p>OTC epinephrine is available in various concentrations for oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inhalation</a> or as a solution in vaporized form (nebulization). Both forms may or may not contain alcohol or sulfite as preservatives. For example, AsthmaHaler Mist does not contain alcohol. Alcohol and sulfite preservatives may trigger an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_asthma_attack_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthma attack</a>, and therefore, patients whose asthma is sensitive to these preservatives should read product labels carefully. The nebulized epinephrine solutions may or may not require diluting with a separate saline (salt) solution before use. Several saline solutions are available OTC in various concentrations. Again, careful reading of the label will provide information about combining an epinephrine solution for nebulization with a specific saline solution. Oral epinephrine is unavailable because it is rapidly broken down in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestive system</a> before it can reach the lungs. Once inhaled, epinephrine should provide rapid relief of symptoms (within five to 10 minutes) and continue working for one to three hours. Good inhaler and nebulizing techniques are critical in the use of epinephrine. If patients use epinephrine frequently, tolerance to its effects occurs; that is, repeated inhalations provide progressively less and less benefit. Previously chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were used as the propellant for inhaler therapy. These have been banned and replaced by alternative propellant, hydrofloroalkane (HFA). The CFCs were felt to contribute to damage to the ozone layer.</p>.<p>OTC ephedrine is available only as an oral medication in combination with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guaifenesin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">guaifenesin</a> as caplets, tablets, or syrup. (Guaifenesin is an expectorant that reportedly loosens mucus in the airways and facilitates its removal by coughing, though health researchers haven't proven this conclusively.) Use caution when first starting these products since they occasionally irritate the airways of some patients and may make the asthma worse. OTC ephedrine should provide relief of symptoms within 15-60 minutes and may continue to be effective for three to five hours. Continued use of ephedrine, like frequent use of epinephrine, leads to tolerance.</p>.<p>Discontinue epinephrine or ephedrine if thick mucus or sputum (colored mucus) develops and/or a persistent or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chronic cough</a> occurs with the asthma. These may be signs of infection in the lungs and require immediate medical attention. If OTC asthma drugs do not relieve an episode of asthma within 10 (for epinephrine) or 60 minutes (for ephedrine) or the symptoms worsen, the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Repeated use of these agents should be strongly discouraged, unless under direct medical supervision.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_side_effects_and_drug_interactions_are_there_with_otc_asthma_medicines" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ephedrine poses a greater risk of causing adverse drug effects or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_interactions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drug interactions</a> than epinephrine because it must be absorbed into the body to be effective.
