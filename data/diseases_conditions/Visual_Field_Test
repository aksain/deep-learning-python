<p><b><a name="what_is_a_visual_field_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A visual field test is a method of measuring an individual's entire scope of vision, that is their central and peripheral (side) vision. Visual field testing maps the visual fields of each eye individually and can detect blind spots (scotomas) as well as more subtle areas of dim vision. The visual field test is a subjective examination, so the patient must be able to understand the testing instructions, fully cooperate, and complete the entire test in order to provide useful information.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_visual_field_test_used_for" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Visual field testing is most frequently used to detect signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a> damage to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">optic nerve</a>.

Visual field testing is performed one eye at a time, with the opposite eye completely covered to avoid errors. In all testing, the patient must look straight ahead at all times in order accurately map the peripheral visual field. Most modern visual field testing devices also continuously monitor fixation, or the ability of the patient to maintain a consistent straight ahead gaze.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_specialists_perform_visual_field_tests" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Visual field tests are performed most often by eye doctors (optometrists and ophthalmologists) and neurologists. These specialists have training in visual field interpretation. The cost of visual field testing is usually covered by medical insurance.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_visual_field_tests" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_a_visual_field_test_take" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Visual field testing requires a minimal amount of time for most otherwise healthy patients, but it may be tiring or stressful for those who are ill or elderly. Visual field testing is also very difficult for younger children, patients with mental disabilities or developmental delay, or anyone with slowed reflexes or poor attention span.</p>.<p>If the first visual field test is read as abnormal or inconclusive because it was inaccurate, it may need to be repeated. It is not uncommon for patients to forget to keep their gazed fixed straight ahead. With repeat visual field testing, most patients find their ability to maintain a steady straight-ahead gaze improves, thus improving the reliability of the results.</p>.<p>The following are common testing times for visual fields in both eyes:</p>
