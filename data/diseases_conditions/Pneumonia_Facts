<p>Pneumonia is an inflammation of the airspaces (alveoli; singular alveolus) in the lung most commonly caused by infections. Bacteria, viruses, or fungi (infrequently) can cause the infection. There are also a few noninfectious types of pneumonia that are caused by inhaling or aspirating foreign matter or toxic substances into the lungs.</p>.<p>Some cases of pneumonia are life-threatening. Around 50,000 people die each year of pneumonia in the U.S. Although anyone of any age can be affected, pneumonia is more common in elderly people and often occurs when the immune system becomes weakened via a prior infection or another condition.</p>.<p>Pneumonia is generally more serious when it affects older adults, infants and young children, those with chronic medical conditions, or those with weakened immune function.</p>.<p>Pneumonia can be classified or characterized in different ways. Health care professionals often refer to pneumonia based upon the way that the infection is acquired, such as community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.</p>.<p>Other classification systems for pneumonia describe the way the inflammatory cells infiltrate the lung tissue or the appearance of the affected tissue (see the following examples).</p>.<p>Sometimes, types of pneumonia are referred to by the type of organism that causes the inflammation, such as bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or fungal pneumonia. The specific organism name may also be used to describe the types of pneumonia, such as pneumococcal (<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Streptococcus</a> pneumoniae</i>) pneumonia or <i>Legionella</i> pneumonia.</p>.<p>Other types of pneumonia that are commonly referenced include the following:</p>.<p>Most types of bacterial pneumonia are not highly contagious. Even though it is possible to spread bacteria from one person to another, pneumonia typically occurs in people with risk factors or weakened immune defenses when bacteria that are normally present in the nose or throat invade the lung tissue. Any kind of bacterial or viral pneumonia has the potential to be contagious, but <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (the cause of tuberculosis) are two types of bacterial pneumonia that are highly contagious. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Breathing</a> in infected droplets that come from patients who are coughing or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sneezing</a> can spread the disease to others.</p>.<p>It is impossible to say with certainty exactly how long an adult or child with pneumonia is contagious, since this varies according to the type of germ or organism that caused the pneumonia. This contagious period can range from one to two days to weeks. In general, while an infected person is coughing or sneezing, there is the potential to release contaminated droplets into the air.</p>.<p>Many bacterial pneumonias are much less contagious after antibiotics have been taken for about 24-48 hours. However, this time period may vary for some organisms. For example, with tuberculosis, it can take two weeks or more of antibiotics before the person is no longer contagious. With viral pneumonias, the patient becomes less contagious after the symptoms have improved, especially <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a>. Some people with viral pneumonia may not be contagious after one to two days with no fever, but others may still shed some infectious virus particles for a much longer time.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, a type of bacteria, is the most common cause of pneumonia. <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is the bacterial type that causes the pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called "atypical" pneumonia, <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Chlamydophila pneumonia</i>. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> is a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia. It most commonly causes disease in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a> and children younger than 5 years of age. Adults 65 years or older, American Indians, and Alaska Natives are also at increased risk for developing <em>H. influenzae</em> disease.</p>.<p>The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present. Influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), however, may cause serious problems in some patients. Other virus types that can cause pneumonia include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">measles</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">varicella</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chickenpox</a>) viruses. Rarely, certain viruses may cause lethal pneumonias such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">SARS</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">severe acute respiratory syndrome</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mers_middle_east_respiratory_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">MERS</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mers_middle_east_respiratory_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Middle East respiratory syndrome</a>); both diseases are caused by different coronaviruses.</p>.<p>Fungi that cause pneumonia include <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cryptococcosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cryptococcus</a></i>, <i>Histoplasma</i>, and <i>Coccidioides</i>. In most individuals, these organisms don't cause illness, but they can cause pneumonia in some people. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fungal_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Fungal infections</a> are most common in those with weakened immune systems due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV/AIDS</a> or those taking medications that suppress immune function. Another infection that is considered a fungal type of pneumonia is <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i>, formerly known as <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>. This organism became known as a frequent cause of pneumonia in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv-aids_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">HIV/AIDS</a>.</p>.<p>The emphasis of this article is the more common causes of infectious pneumonias, but there are others that may be caused by noninfectious lung irritants like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inhalation</a> of chemicals, foods, gasses, liquids, and/or dust.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are a number of factors that increase the risk of developing pneumonia. These include</p>.<p>The incubation period for pneumonia depends on the type of organism causing the disease, as well as characteristics of the patient, such as his or her age and overall health status. Most cases of pneumonia begin with symptoms similar to those of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold</a> or the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a> that last longer than the flu (about seven to 10 days) and become more severe. The symptoms of pneumonia can occur from a few days to a week following the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">flu-like symptoms</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Symptoms and signs of pneumonia may be mild or severe and depend upon someone's overall state of health as well as the type of organism causing the pneumonia. Severe symptoms of pneumonia include</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a> are other possible symptoms that can accompany the respiratory symptoms.</p>.<p>Infants and newborns may not show specific symptoms of pneumonia. Instead, the baby or child may appear restless or lethargic. A baby or child with pneumonia may also have a fever or cough or vomit. Older adults or those who have weak immune systems may also have fewer symptoms and a lower temperature. A change in mental status, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">confusion</a>, can develop in older adults with pneumonia.</p>.<p></p>.<p>The duration of symptoms varies according to the type of pneumonia and the underlying health status of the individual. In previously healthy people, pneumonia can be a mild illness that resolves within two to three weeks. In older adults and in those with chronic diseases or other health problems, recovery may take six to eight weeks or longer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The diagnosis of pneumonia always begins with taking a medical history and performing a physical examination to look for characteristic signs. In particular, listening to the lungs may reveal areas where sound is diminished, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wheezing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">wheezing</a>, or crackling sounds in affected areas. Some commonly performed diagnostic tests are as follows:</p>.<p>Antibiotic medications are the treatment of choice for pneumonia caused by bacterial and fungal infections. The exact choice of medications depends on many factors, including the following:</p>.<p>About 80% of cases of CAP can be managed at home with the patient taking oral antibiotics. There are numerous treatment regimens available. Initial treatment (before the causative organism has been identified) is called empiric treatment and is based upon the organisms most likely to be responsible for the illness. Once the exact organism has been identified in the laboratory and susceptibility testing performed to determine which antibiotics are effective, the treatment regimen can be further individualized. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Over-the-counter</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> and fever-reducing medications may be recommended for some people in addition to antibiotics or antiviral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> for symptom relief. Do not take cough or cold medications when suffering from pneumonia without a doctor's approval.</p>.<p>In around 20% of cases, CAP must be managed in the hospital, typically with intravenous antibiotics initially. HAP care is managed in the hospital, typically with intravenous antibiotics.</p>.<p>Antibiotics are not effective against viral pneumonia. Depending upon the type of virus that causes pneumonia, antiviral medications can provide benefit when started early in the course of the disease. For example, the medications <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oseltamivir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">oseltamivir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oseltamivir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tamiflu</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zanamivir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">zanamivir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zanamivir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Relenza</a>) are used to treat influenza virus infections. Antifungal agents are used to treat most fungal pneumonias.</p>.<p>In some cases, primary care physicians, including pediatricians, internists, and family medicine specialists, may manage the care for patients with pneumonia. In more severe cases, other types of specialists may be involved in treating the patient with pneumonia. These include infectious-disease specialists, pulmonologists, critical care specialists, and hospitalists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are a number of potential complications of pneumonia. The infection that causes pneumonia can spread to the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis is a serious condition that can result in lowering of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a> and failure of oxygen to reach the tissues of the body, resulting in the need for intensive care management. Another complication is the accumulation of fluid in the space between the lung tissue and the chest wall lining, known as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pleural_effusion_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pleural effusion</a>. The organisms responsible for the pneumonia may infect the fluid in a pleural effusion, known as an empyema. Pneumonia can also result in the formation of an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abscess</a> (collection of pus) within the lungs or airways.</p>.<p></p>.<p>Most people with pneumonia improve after three to five days of antibiotic treatment, but a mild cough and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fatigue</a> can last longer, up to a month. Patients who required treatment in a hospital may take longer to see improvement.</p>.<p>Pneumonia can also be fatal. The mortality (death) rate is up to 30% for patients with severe pneumonia who require treatment in an intensive care unit. Overall, around 5%-10% of patients who are treated in a hospital setting die from the disease. Pneumonia is more likely to be fatal in the elderly or those with chronic medical conditions or a weakened immune system.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>It is not possible to prevent all types of pneumonia, but one can take steps to reduce the chance of contracting the condition by quitting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a>, practicing good hand-washing, and avoiding contact with people who have colds, the flu, or other infections.</p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> is available against the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (also known as <i>Pneumococcus</i>). There are two types of vaccine: PPSV23 (Pneumovax), a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine against 23 types of the bacteria, and PCV13 (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumococcal_pediatric_vaccine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Prevnar 13</a>), a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that protects against 13 types of the bacteria. These <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> may not always prevent pneumococcal pneumonia, but they may prevent serious complications of pneumonia if it does occur.</p>.<p>Avoidance of areas where fungal pathogens are endemic is recommended to prevent fungal pneumonias. There is no antifungal vaccine available; however, for some high-risk patients, some doctors have recommended prophylactic antifungal drugs.</p>.<p></p>.<p>Side effects of PCV13 in children include drowsiness, temporary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loss of appetite</a>, or redness, swelling, or tenderness where the shot was given. Mild fever and irritability are other common side effects. Adults receiving pneumococcal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> have reported <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a>, redness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>, and swelling where the shot was given; also mild fever, fatigue, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, chills, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_pain_myalgia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">muscle pain</a>.</p>.<p>Any type of vaccine has the potential to cause an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergic reaction</a>, which can be severe, but this side effect is rare. This would happen within minutes to a few hours after receiving the vaccine.</p>.<p>PCV13 or Prevnar 13, is currently recommended for all children younger than 2 years of age, all adults 65 years of age or older, and people 2-64 years of age with certain medical conditions.</p>.<p>PPSV23 is currently recommended for all adults 65 years of age or older and for people who are 2 years of age or older and at high risk for pneumococcal disease (for example, those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sickle cell disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> infection, or other immunocompromising conditions). PPSV23 is also recommended for use in adults 19-64 years of age who smoke cigarettes.</p>.<p>There is no evidence about the safety of PCV13 or PPSV23 vaccine use in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>. Women who need the vaccine should be vaccinated before a pregnancy, if possible.</p>.<p>Some people may be recommended to receive both the PCV13 and PPSV23 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a>. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends two pneumococcal vaccines for all adults 65 years or older. The PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be given at the same time. When both vaccines are recommended, a dose of the PCV13 should be given first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 at another visit to a health care provider.</p>.<p>Seasonal influenza vaccines are available yearly and are recommended to decrease the chance of contracting influenza. Vaccines against the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/measles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">measles</a> virus and varicella virus, two viruses that can also cause pneumonia, are also available. The common side effects of these vaccines are similar to those listed below for the pneumonia vaccine.<!-- AIA --></p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>
