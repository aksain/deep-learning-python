Cunha, DO, FACOEP</a></p>.<p><b><a name="penile_cancer_is_a_disease_in_which_malignant_cancer_cells_form_in_the_tissues_of_the_penis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The penis is a rod-shaped male reproductive organ that passes sperm and urine from the body. It contains two types of erectile tissue (spongy tissue with blood vessels that fill with blood to make an erection):</p>.<p>The erectile tissue is wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin. The glans (head of the penis) is covered with loose skin called the foreskin.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="human_papillomavirus_infection_may_increase_the_risk_of_developing_penile_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for penile cancer include the following:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/circumcision_the_medical_pros_and_cons/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Circumcision</a> may help prevent infection with the human papillomavirus (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">HPV</a>). A circumcision is an operation in which the doctor removes part or all of the foreskin from the penis. Many boys are circumcised shortly after birth. Men who were not circumcised at birth may have a higher risk of developing penile cancer.</p>.<p>Other risk factors for penile cancer include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_of_penile_cancer_include_sores_discharge_and_bleeding" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs may be caused by penile cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="tests_that_examine_the_penis_are_used_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_penile_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used:</p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="stages_of_penile_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.</p>.<p>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.</p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.</p>.<p>In stage 0, abnormal cells or growths that look like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">warts</a> are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">carcinoma in situ</a>.</p>.<p>In stage I, cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels. The tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope.</p>.<p>In stage II, cancer has spread:</p>.<p>Stage III is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb.</p>.<p>In stage IIIa, cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin. Cancer has also spread:</p>.<p>In stage IIIb, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. Cancer has also spread:</p>.<p>In stage IV, cancer has spread:</p>.<p>Recurrent penile cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the penis or in other parts of the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_penile_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatments are available for patients with penile cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p>Surgery is the most common treatment for all stages of penile cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations:</p>.<p>Lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery.</p>.<p>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a> therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">x-rays</a> or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy.</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.Â External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly onto the skin (topical chemotherapy) or into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Topical chemotherapy may be used to treat stage 0 penile cancer.</p>.<p>Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/biological_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">biotherapy</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy_shots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">immunotherapy</a>. Topical biologic therapy with imiquimod may be used to treat stage 0 penile cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="new_types_of_treatment_are_being_tested_in_clinical_trials" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.</p>.<p>Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells.</p>.<p><b>Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery</b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sentinel_lymph_node_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Sentinel lymph node biopsy</a> is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the cancer.</p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p><b>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.</b></p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_by_stage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of stage 0 may be one of the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.</p>.<p>If the cancer is only in the foreskin, wide local excision and circumcision may be the only treatment needed.</p>.<p>Treatment of stage I penile cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage II penile cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage III penile cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage IV penile cancer is usually palliative (to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life).
