<p><b><a name="what_is_binswangers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Binswanger's disease (BD), also called subcortical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/vascular_multi-infarct_dementia_1_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vascular dementia</a>, is a type of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dementia</a> caused by widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of white matter in the brain. The damage is the result of the thickening and narrowing (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerosis</a>) of arteries that feed the subcortical areas of the brain. Atherosclerosis (commonly known as "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_pathology_photo_essay/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hardening of the arteries</a>") is a systemic process that affects blood vessels throughout the body. It begins late in the fourth decade of life and increases in severity with age. As the arteries become more and more narrowed, the blood supplied by those arteries decreases and brain tissue dies. A characteristic pattern of Binswanger's disease-damaged brain tissue can be seen with modern brain imaging techniques such as 
CT scans or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>).  

</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_binswangers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms associated with Binswanger's disease are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits that control what neuroscientists call executive cognitive functioning:  

</p>.<p>The most characteristic feature of Binswanger's disease is psychomotor slowness - an increase in the length of time it takes, for example, for the fingers to turn the thought of a letter into the shape of a letter on a piece of paper.  

</p>.<p>Other symptoms include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_binswangers_disease_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Brain imaging, which reveals the characteristic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_lesions_lesions_on_the_brain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain lesions</a> of Binswanger's 
disease, is essential for a positive diagnosis. 

</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_treatment_for_binswangers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no specific course of treatment for Binswanger's disease. Treatment is symptomatic.  
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_binswangers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Binswanger's disease is a progressive disease; there is no cure. Changes may be sudden or gradual and then progress in a stepwise manner. 
Binswanger's disease can often coexist with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a>. Behaviors that slow the progression of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, and atherosclerosis -- such as eating a 
healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> and keeping healthy wake/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> schedules, 
exercising, and not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> or drinking too much alcohol -- can also slow the progression of Binswanger's disease.

Binswanger's disease in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure neurological disorders, such as 
Binswanger's disease.
