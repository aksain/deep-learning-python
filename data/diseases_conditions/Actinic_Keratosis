Actinic keratoses characteristically appear on photo-damaged skin. Actinic keratosis is also referred to as a solar keratosis.</p>.<p>Specialized forms of actinic keratoses include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/cutaneous_horns_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">cutaneous horns</a>, in which the skin protrudes in a thick, hornlike manner, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/actinic_cheilitis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">actinic cheilitis</a>, a scaling and roughness of the lower lip and blurring of the border of the lip and adjacent skin. There are other causes of cutaneous horns, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">warts</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/freckles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">age spots</a> (seborrheic keratoses).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_%0Aan_actinic_keratosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Actinic keratoses generally range in size between 2-6 mm in diameter (between the size of a pencil point and that of an eraser). They are usually reddish in color, with a rough texture and often have a white or yellowish scale on top. There is often a prickling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pain</a> felt when it is touched.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_for_actinic_keratoses" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Those who develop actinic keratoses tend to be fair-skinned people who have spent years outdoors at work or at play or who have exposed their skin to indoor tanning <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">radiation</a>. Their skin often becomes wrinkled, mottled, and thinned from sun exposure. Others at risk for developing actinic keratoses include those who have their immune systems suppressed, such as organ-transplant patients, as well as patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a> treated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puva_therapy_photochemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PUVA</a> therapy (long-wave ultraviolet light plus an oral drug called psoralen).</p>.<p><b><a name="where_on_the_body_do_actinic_keratoses_typically_occur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Common locations for actinic keratoses are the cheeks, bridge of the nose, rim of the ears, scalp, back of the neck, upper chest, and the tops of the hands and forearms. Men are more likely to develop AKs on top of the ears, whereas women's hairstyles often protect this area.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_significance_of_an_actinic_keratosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Actinic keratoses are precancerous (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">premalignant</a>), which means they may develop into invasive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">skin cancer</a>. Although the chance of an individual actinic keratosis progressing into an invasive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">squamous cell carcinoma</a> is less than 1%, patients with many of these lesions (very common) who continue to expose their skin to carcinogenic ultraviolet sunlight are likely to develop invasive skin cancers. Squamous cell skin cancers are locally destructive and have a small but real potential for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a> (spreading to other areas). Treating actinic keratoses at an early stage will help prevent invasive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_melanoma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">skin cancer</a>. When patients are diagnosed with this condition, they often say, "But I never go out in the sun!" The explanation for this is that there can be a long delay, even decades, for these keratoses to develop. Short periods of sun exposure do not generally either produce actinic keratoses or transform them into skin cancers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_diagnose_actinic_keratoses" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generally, primary-care physicians or dermatologists can diagnose and care for actinic keratosis. If the lesion is especially large or thick, a biopsy may be advisable to make sure that the spot in question has not become a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/skin_cancer_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">skin cancer</a>.</p>.<p>There are other spots, called seborrheic keratoses, which are not caused by sun exposure and have no relationship to skin cancers. These are raised brown lesions that may appear on any area of the skin. They also often run in families.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_an_actinic_keratosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best treatment for an AK is prevention. For light-skinned individuals, this means minimizing their sun exposure. By the time actinic keratoses develop, however, the relevant ultraviolet radiation is often so far in the past that prudent preventive measures play a relatively small role. Fortunately, treatment methods are usually simple and straightforward:</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_home_remedies_for_actinic_keratoses" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no home remedies for actinic keratoses, but most will resolve spontaneously if sun exposure can be strictly limited. Those lesions that do not resolve need professional medical attention.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_actinic_keratoses" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sun avoidance is the simplest way to avoid actinic keratoses. This would include applications of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">SPF</a> 50 sunscreens to exposed skin, wearing sun-protective clothing, shade-seeking behavior, and avoiding tanning. Concerns about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d_deficiency/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamin D deficiency</a> can be avoided by taking multivitamin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_an_actinic_keratosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients who develop actinic keratoses are usually well advised to have a doctor examine them at least annually. The purpose of these regular checks is to be sure that new lesions have not developed and that old ones are not becoming thicker and more suspicious looking (for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>). Furthermore, continual avoidance of excessive sun exposure can decrease the risk of recurrences.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
