<p><b><a name="food_poisoning_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Food poisoning is a food borne disease. Ingestion of food that contains a toxin, chemical or infectious agent (like a bacterium, virus, parasite, or prion) may cause adverse symptoms in the body. Those symptoms may be related only to the gastrointestinal tract causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a> or they may involve other organs such as the kidney, brain, or muscle.</p>.<p>Typically most food borne diseases cause vomiting and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">diarrhea</a> that tend to be short lived and resolve on their own, but <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolyte</a> abnormalities may develop. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates approximately 48 million people become ill from food-related diseases each year resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths.</p>.<p>According to the CDC, in 2011, the most common food-borne illnesses in the United States each year are caused by <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/norovirus_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Norovirus</a></i>, and the bacteria <i>Campylobacter</i>, <i>Clostridium</i> <i>perfringens</i>, and <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/salmonella_food_poisoning_salmonellosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Salmonella</a></i>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Food poisoning most commonly causes:</p>.<p>This can cause significant amounts of fluid loss and diarrhea along with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a> and vomiting may make it difficult to replace lost fluid, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a>. In developing countries where infectious epidemics cause diarrheal illnesses, thousands of people die because of dehydration.</p>.<p>As noted in the section above, other organ systems may be infected and affected by food poisoning. Symptoms will depend upon what organ system is involved (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalopathy</a> due to brain infection).</p>.<p><b><a name="are_food_poisoning_and_stomach_flu_the_same_thing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Food poisoning and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stomach flu</a> may or may not be the same thing, depending if the causative agent is transmitted by contaminated food, or if the agent is transmitted by non-food mechanisms such as body secretions. Most health-care professionals equate stomach <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a> to viral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroenteritis</a>.</p>.<p>Stomach flu is a non-specific term that describes an illness that usually resolves within 24 hours and is caused commonly by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">adenovirus</a>, Norwalk virus or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rotavirus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rotavirus</a>, (rotavirus is most commonly found in children).</p>.<p>If numerous cases of "stomach flu" occur in a situation where many people have been eating, it certainly may be considered food poisoning. Norwalk virus is responsible for many cases of food borne illness outbreaks on cruise ships.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_food_poisoning_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most cases of food poisoning last about 1 to 2 days and symptoms resolve on their own. If symptoms persist longer than that, the affected person should contact their health-care professional.</p>.<p><i>Cyclospora</i> infections may be difficult to detect and diarrhea may last for weeks. Health-care professionals may consider this parasite as the potential cause of food poisoning in patients with prolonged symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most frequently, food poisoning may be due to infection caused by bacteria, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a>, parasites, and infrequently, prions. More than 200 infectious causes exist. Sometimes it is not the bacteria that causes the problem, but rather the toxin that bacteria produce in the food before it is eaten. This is the case with <i>Staphylococcal</i> food poisoning and with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/botulism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">botulism</a>.</p>.<p>Other illnesses may involve chemical toxins that are produced in certain foods that are poorly cooked or stored. For example, scombroid poisoning occurs due to a large release of histamine chemical from the fish when it is eaten. It causes facial swelling, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>, and difficulty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> and swallowing - just like an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergic reaction</a>. Scombroid poisoning is sometimes confused with a shellfish <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>.</p>.<p>Some "food poisonings" may not be due to toxins or chemicals in food but to infectious agents that happen to contaminate the food. <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli</a> O157:H7</i> (hemorrhagic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli_0157h7_escherichia_coli_0157h7/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">E. coli</a>) usually occurs when contaminated food is eaten, but it also can spread from contaminated drinking water, a contaminated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swimming/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">swimming</a> pool, or passed from child to child in a daycare center.</p>.<p><i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/listeria/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Listeria</a></i> is a type of bacteria that has caused the two most deadly outbreaks of food poisoning in United States history. In 1985, an outbreak in California was traced to eating a type of fresh cheese, and in 2011, <i>Listeria</i> food poisoning was traced to a cantaloupe farm and processing operation in Colorado. It is most often associated with eating soft cheeses, raw milk, contaminated fruits, vegetables, poultry, and meats. Newborns, the elderly, and others with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of becoming ill with <i>Listeria</i> infections. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Pregnant</a> women are also at higher risk of contracting <i>Listeria</i> infections and are recommended to avoid soft cheeses like brie, camembert, and blue (cream cheese is safe) to avoid infection and to prevent transmission to the fetus.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There many causes of food poisoning. Sometimes they are classified by how quickly the symptoms begin after eating potentially contaminated food. Think of this as the incubation time from when food enters the body until symptoms begin. The following are examples of how this time classification can be arranged:</p>.<p><b><a name="short_incubation_of_less_than_16_to_24_hours" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="intermediate_incubation_from_about_1_to_3_days" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Infections of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">large intestine</a> or colon can cause bloody, mucousy diarrhea associated with crampy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abdominal pain</a>.</p>.<p>Diarrhea due to small bowel infection tends not to be bloody, but infections may affect both the small and large intestine at the same time.</p>.<p><b><a name="long_incubation_of_3_to_5_days" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="very_long_incubation_of_up_to_a_month" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Parasites</b></p>.<p><b>Bacteria</b></p>.<p><b>Virus</b></p>.<p><b>Protozoans</b></p>.<p><b>Prion</b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most times, the diagnosis of food poisoning is made by history and physical examination. Often, the patient volunteers the diagnosis when they come for medical care. For example, "I got sick after eating potato salad at a picnic," or, "I drank a raw egg protein shake."</p>.<p>The health-care professional may ask questions about the symptoms, when they started, and how long they have lasted. A review of systems may help give direction as to what type of infection is present. For example, a patient with numbness of their feet and weakness may be asked about whether they have opened any home canned food recently.</p>.<p>Travel history may be helpful to see if the patient had been camping near a stream or lake and the potential for drinking contaminated water, or if they have traveled out of the country recently and have eaten different foods than they normally do, such as raw eggs or wild game.</p>.<p>Physical examination begins with taking the vital signs of the patient (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a>, pulse rate, and temperature). Clinical signs of dehydration include dry, tenting skin, sunken eyes, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a>, and lack of sweat in the armpits and groin. In infants, in addition to the above, subtle signs of dehydration may include poor muscle tone, poor suckling, and sunken fontanelle.</p>.<p>Routine blood tests are not usually ordered unless there is concern about something more than the vomiting and diarrhea. In patients with significant dehydration, the health-care professional may want to check electrolyte levels in the blood as well as kidney function. If there is concern about hemolytic uremic syndrome, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">complete blood count</a> (hemogram, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>) to check the red blood cells, white blood cells, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">platelet count</a> may be ordered. If there is concern about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver function</a> tests may be ordered.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Stool</a> samples may be useful especially if there is concern about infections caused by <i>Salmonella, Shigella</i>, and <i>Campylobacter</i>, the common non <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">traveler</a>'s diarrhea. This is especially true when the patient presents with bloody diarrhea, thought to be due to infection. If there is concern about a parasite infection, stool samples can be examined also for the presence of parasites. Some parasites may be very difficult to see under the microscope, including <i>Cyclospora</i>, because it is so tiny.</p>.<p>Depending on the suspected cause of the food poisoning, there are some immunological tests (for example, detection of Shiga toxins) that the CDC recommends. <i>Cyclospora</i> DNA may be detected in the stool using molecular testing called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">polymerase chain reaction</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a>). Other methods may be used (for example, detection of prions in tissue samples).<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_and_home_remedies_treat_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The key to home care is being able to keep the person hydrated. Drinking a lot of water or a balanced electrolyte solution such as Gatorade or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolyte_solution-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pedialyte</a> usually is adequate to replenish the body with fluids. A person can lose a significant amount of fluid with an episode of diarrhea and/or vomiting, and these fluids need to be replaced. People who show any signs of dehydration such as decreased urination, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dizziness</a>, or dry mucous membranes, especially in the young or elderly, should see a health-care professional.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first and most important complication of food poisoning is dehydration. Food poisoning can cause significant loss of body water and changes in the electrolyte levels in the blood.</p>.<p>If the affected individual has underlying medical conditions requiring medication, persistent vomiting may make it difficult to swallow and digest those medications.</p>.<p>Other complications of food poisoning are specific to the type of infection. Some are listed in the causes of food poisoning such as HUS, TTP, or encephalopathy.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_the_doctor_be_called_for_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>With a clear fluid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> and rest, most infections resolve on their own within 24 hours.
