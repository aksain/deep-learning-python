Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an overactive, misdirected immune system that attacks one's own body. Because arteries are involved, the disease can affect any organ of the body. The most common areas of involvement include the muscles, joints, intestines (bowels), nerves, kidneys, and skin. Poor function or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> in any of these organs can be a symptom. Poor blood supply to the bowels can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>, local bowel death, and bleeding. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> are common. Polyarteritis nodosa is often abbreviated PAN.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_polyarteritis_nodosa" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Polyarteritis nodosa is most common in middle-age people. Its cause is unknown, but it has been reported after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis B</a> infection. Polyarteritis is not felt to be an inherited condition.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_polyarteritis_nodosa" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Polyarteritis nodosa causes symptoms and signs that are a result of injury to the blood vessels. Therefore, the symptoms and signs depend on which vessels are affected and to what degree. This can lead to organ damage or injury. For example, if blood vessels supplying the nerves or muscles are affected, the nerves or muscles can be damaged. If the blood vessels to the kidneys are affected, kidney damage with blood in the urine can result.

In patients with nerves affected, nerve conduction tests are abnormal.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is confirmed by a biopsy of involved tissue that reveals the inflamed blood vessels (vasculitis). Examples of tissues that are sometimes biopsied include nerves, muscle, kidneys, and bowel. Vasculitis of the bowel and kidneys can often be detected with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angiogram</a> (X-ray testing while contrast "dye" is infused into the blood vessels).</p>.<p>The American College of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Rheumatology</a> established criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa in 1990.

Treatment is directed toward decreasing the inflammation of the arteries by suppressing the immune system.
