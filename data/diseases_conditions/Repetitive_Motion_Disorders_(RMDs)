for RMDs usually includes reducing or stopping the motions that cause symptoms. 
Options include taking breaks to give the affected area time to rest, and adopting stretching and relaxation exercises. Applying ice to the 
affected area and using medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> relievers, cortisone, and 
anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>   
  can reduce pain and swelling. Splints may be able to 
relieve pressure on the muscles and nerves. Physical therapy may relieve the 
soreness and pain in the muscles and joints. In rare cases, surgery may be 
required to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent damage. Some employers have 
developed ergonomic programs to help workers adjust their pace of work and 
arrange office equipment to minimize problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocc" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most individuals with RMDs recover completely and can avoid re-injury by 
changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which 
they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. Without 
treatment, RMDs may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in 
the affected area.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Much of the on-going research on
