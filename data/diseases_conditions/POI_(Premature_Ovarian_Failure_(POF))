<p><b><a name="what_is_primary_ovarian_insufficiency_poi" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Health care providers use the term POI when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40 years of age.<sup>1,2</sup>
</p>.<p>
Many women naturally experience reduced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fertility</a> when they are around 40 years old. This age may mark the start of 
irregular menstrual periods that signal the onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility occur before the age of 40, sometimes as early as the teenage years.<sup>3,4</sup>
</p>.<p>
In the past, POI used to be called "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premature_menopause_medical_procedural_causes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premature menopause</a>" or "premature ovarian failure," but those terms do not accurately describe what happens in a woman with POI. A woman who has gone through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause_and_perimenopause_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a> will never have another normal period and cannot get <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a>. A woman with POI may still have periods, even though they might not come regularly, and she may still 
get pregnant.<sup>2,4</sup></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_primary_ovarian_insufficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first sign of POI is usually menstrual irregularities or missed periods,<sup>2</sup> which is sometimes called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amenorrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amenorrhea</a> (pronounced ey-men-uh-REE-uh or uh-men-uh-REE-uh).
</p>.<p>
In addition, some women with POI have symptoms similar to those experienced by women who are going through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">natural menopause</a>, including:
</p>.<p>

For many women with POI, trouble <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">getting pregnant</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a> is the first symptom they experience and is what leads them to visit their health care provider. This is sometimes called 
"occult" (hidden) or early POI.<sup>6</sup><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_many_women_are_affected_by_or_at_risk_for_primary_ovarian_insufficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Estimates suggest that about 1% of women and teenage girls in the United States have POI.<sup>1</sup> Researchers estimate that, categorized by age, POI affects:</p>.<p>

Several factors can affect a woman's risk for POI:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_primary_ovarian_insufficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is a mystery.<sup>4,6,11</sup></p>.<p>

Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles (pronounced FOL-i-kulz)â€”the small sacs in the ovaries in which eggs grow and mature.<sup>6</sup></p>.<p>

Follicles start out as microscopic seeds called primordial (pronounced prahy-MAWR-dee-uhl) follicles. These seeds are not yet follicles, but they can grow into them. Normally, a woman is born with approximately 2 million primordial follicles,<sup>12</sup> typically enough to last until she goes through natural <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>, usually around age 50.<sup>4</sup></p>.<p>

For a woman with POI, there are problems with the follicles:<sup>1</sup></p>.<p>

Although the exact cause is unknown in a majority of cases, some causes of follicle depletion and dysfunction have been identified:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_primary_ovarian_insufficiency_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The key signs of POI are:</p>.<p>

If a woman is younger than age 40 and begins having irregular periods or stops having periods for 4 months or longer, her health care provider may take these steps to diagnose the problem:</p>.<p>

The health care provider will also ask questions about a woman's medical history. He or she may ask about:</p>.<p>

If they do not do tests to rule out POI, some health care providers might assume missed periods are related to 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>.<sup>4</sup> However, this approach is problematic because it will lead to a delay in diagnosis; further evaluation is needed.<sup>4</sup><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_associated_disorders_or_conditions_associated_with_primary_ovarian_insufficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because POI results in lower levels of certain hormones, women with POI are at greater risk for a number of health conditions, including:</p>.<p>

Addison's disease is also associated with POI. Addison's disease is a life-threatening condition that affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that help the body respond to physical stress, such as illness and injury. These hormones also affect ovary function.<sup>14</sup> About 3% of women with POI have Addison's disease.<sup>15</sup><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_primary_ovarian_insufficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.<sup>1,2</sup> But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI, as well as treatments and behaviors to reduce health risks and conditions associated with POI.</p>.<p>

It is also important to note that between 5% and 10% of women with POI get pregnant without medical intervention after they are diagnosed with POI. Some research suggests that these women go into what is known as "spontaneous remission" of POI, meaning that the ovaries begin to function normally on their own. When the ovaries are working properly, fertility is restored and the women can get pregnant.</p>.<p><b><a name="hormone_replacement_therapy_hrt" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HRT</a> is the most common treatment for women with POI. It gives the body the 
estrogen and other hormones that the ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual 
health and decreases the risks for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiovascular disease</a> (including 
heart 
attacks, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>.<sup>17</sup>
</p>.<p>If a woman with POI begins HRT, she is expected to start having regular 
periods again. In addition, HRT is expected to reduce other symptoms, such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hot_flashes/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hot flashes</a> and night sweats, and help maintain bone health.<sup>1,13,17,26</sup> HRT 
will not prevent pregnancy, and evidence suggests it might improve pregnancy 
rates for women with POI by lowering high levels of luteinizing hormone - which 
stimulates <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ovulation</a> - to normal in some women.<sup>19</sup>
</p>.<p>HRT is usually a combination of an estrogen and a progestin. A progestin is a 
form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/progesterone-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">progesterone</a>. Sometimes, the combination might also include 
testosterone, although this approach is controversial.<sup>11</sup> HRT 
comes in several forms: pills, creams, gels, patches that stick onto the skin, 
an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iud/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intrauterine device</a>, or a vaginal ring.<sup>14</sup> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/estradiol/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Estradiol</a> 
is the natural form of human estrogen. The optimal method of providing estradiol 
to women with POI is by a skin patch or vaginal ring. These methods are linked 
with a lower risk of potentially fatal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> developing. Most women 
require a dose of 100 micrograms of estradiol per day. It is important to take a 
progestin along with estradiol to balance out the effect of estrogen on the 
lining of the womb. Women who do not take a progestin along with estradiol are 
at increased risk of developing 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/uterine_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">endometrial cancer</a>. The progestin with the best 
evidence available to support use in women with POI is 10 mg of
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/medroxyprogesterone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">medroxyprogesterone</a> acetate by mouth per day for the first 12 calendar days of 
each month.</p>.<p>A health care provider may suggest that a woman with POI take HRT until she 
is about 50 years old, the age at which menopause usually begins.</p>.<p>After that time, she should talk with her health care provider about stopping 
the treatment because of risks associated with using this type of therapy in the 
years after the normal age of menopause.<sup>4</sup></p>.<p>In general, HRT treatment for women with POI is safe and is associated with 
only minimal side effects. Women with POI take HRT to replace hormones their 
bodies would normally be making if they didn't have POI.</p>.<p>The HRT taken by women with POI is different from the hormone therapies taken 
by women who are going through or have gone through natural menopause, which are 
often called menopausal or post-menopausal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hormone therapy</a> (PMHT).</p>.<p>A large, long-term study - called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/womens_health/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Women's Health</a> Initiative - examined the 
effects of a specific type of PMHT, taken for more than 5 years, by women ages 
50 to 79 who had already gone through menopause. This study showed that PMHT was 
associated with an increased risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, blood clots, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a>, heart 
attacks, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a> in these women.<sup>20</sup></p>.<p>These results do not apply to young women with POI who take HRT.<sup>4,14</sup> 
The type and amount of HRT prescribed to women with POI is different from the 
PMHT taken by older women.<sup>4</sup></p>.<p>A woman should talk to her health care provider if she has questions about 
HRT as a treatment for POI. Also, she should tell her health care provider about 
any side effects she experiences while taking HRT. There are many different 
types of HRT. Women should work with their health care providers to find out the 
best type of treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="calcium_and_vitamin_d_supplements" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, they should get 
at least 1,200 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium and 1000 IU (international 
units) of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin D</a>, which helps the body absorb calcium, every day.<sup>21</sup> 
These nutrients are important for bone health.<sup>14</sup> 
A health care provider may do a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bone mineral density</a> test to check for bone 
loss.<sup>19</sup></p>.<p><b><a name="regular_physical_activity_and_healthy_body_weight" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Weight-bearing physical activity, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a>, 
jogging, and stair 
climbing, helps build bone strength and prevents osteoporosis.<sup>14</sup> 
Maintaining a healthy body weight and getting regular physical activity are also 
important for reducing the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a>. These factors can affect 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol levels</a>, which in turn can change the risk for heart disease.<sup>22</sup></p>.<p><b><a name="treatments_for_associated_conditions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>POI is associated with other health conditions, including (but not limited 
to) Addison's disease,
Fragile X permutation, thyroid dysfunction, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>, and 
certain other genetic, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders.</p>.<p>Women who have POI as well as one of these associated conditions will require 
additional treatment for the associated condition. In some cases, treatment 
involves medication or hormone therapy. Other types of treatments might also be 
needed.</p>.<p><b><a name="emotional_support" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For many women who experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a>, including those with POI, feelings 
of loss are common. In one study, almost 9 out of 10 women reported feeling 
moderate to severe emotional distress when they learned of their POI diagnosis.<sup>14, 
26</sup>â€‹ Several organizations offer help finding these types of professionals. 
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="poi_in_teens" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Receiving a diagnosis of POI can be emotionally difficult for teenagers and 
their parents. A teen may have a similar emotional experience as an adult who 
receives the diagnosis, but there are many aspects of the experience that are 
unique to being a teenager. It is important for parents, the teenager, and 
health care providers to work closely together to ensure that the teenager gets 
the right treatment and maintains her emotional and physical health in the long 
term. There are resources to provide advice and support for parents, teenagers, 
and health care providers.<sup>25</sup> <span id="cntid"></span></p>
