<p><b><a name="introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> will experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> at some time or another. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> can result from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> itself, or from the cancers treatment. In addition, some people who have been cured of their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> can continue to suffer from pain.</p>.<p>Cancer pain, or the discomfort that stems from cancer and its treatment, can be controlled most of the time. There are many different medicines and methods available to control cancer pain. People who have cancer and are feeling pain need to inform their doctor immediately. The earlier pain treatment is started, the more effective it is.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_cancer_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">causes of cancer</a> pain, but most cancer pain occurs when a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a> presses on nerves or body organs or when cancer cells invade bones or body organs. Cancer treatments such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a>, or surgery also may cause pain.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_cancer_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of cancer pain vary from person to person. The amount of pain present may depend on the type of cancer, the stage or extent of the disease, and the person's pain threshold (tolerance for pain). Pain can range from mild and occasional to severe and constant.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medicines_are_used_to_treat_cancer_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Mild to Moderate Pain</i></p>.<p><b>Pain relievers:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tylenol</a> and a group of pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">NSAIDs</a>) such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Motrin</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Aleve</a>) can treat mild to moderate pain. Many of these are over-the-counter drugs that do not require a prescription, but some do require a prescription. Patients should check with a physician before using these medicines, especially if chemotherapy is being administered. NSAIDs can slow blood clotting.</p>.<p><i>Moderate to Severe Pain</i></p>.<p><b>Narcotic pain relievers:</b> These drugs include morphine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fentanyl-oral_lozenge_cancer_pain_only/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Actiq</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fentanyl_transdermal_system/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Duragesic</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydromorphone_hydrochloride/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dilaudid</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oxycodone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">oxycodone</a> (sold under the brand names <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oxycodone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">OxyContin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oxycodone_and_acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Percocet</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oxycodone_and_acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tylox</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/codeine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">codeine</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prescription_drug_abuse_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Narcotic</a> pain relievers require a prescription and may be used along with mild pain relievers for moderate to severe pain.</p>.<p><i>Breakthrough Pain</i></p>.<p><b>Onset narcotic pain relievers:</b> Onset narcotic pain relievers, which require a prescription, are used to treat breakthrough pain (a flare-up of pain characterized by rapid onset, severe intensity and short duration).

In most cases, doctors treat cancer pain with pain-relief medicines called analgesics or with non-drug treatments such as physical therapy and rehabilitation, imagery, biofeedback and relaxation techniques.
