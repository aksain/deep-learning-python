Sometimes double fang marks may be seen at the location of the bite. The most common localized symptoms of a black widow spider bite include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_brown_recluse_spider_bite_what_does_the_spider_look_like_pictures" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The bite of a brown recluse spider leads to a mild stinging, followed by local redness and severe pain that usually develops within eight hours but may occur later. Some reports of brown recluse bites describe a blue or purple area around the bite, surrounded by a whitish ring and large red outer ring in a "bull's eye" pattern. A fluid-filled <strong>blister forms</strong> at the site and then sloughs off to reveal a deep ulcer that may turn black.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_black_widow_or_brown_recluse_spider_bite_symptoms_be_the_same" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generalized symptoms of bites from black widow and brown recluse spiders may include:</p>.<p>Rarely, black widow spider bites are fatal; however, a few individuals have died from brown recluse spider bites, which are more common in children than in adults.</p>.<p>If a spider was not observed inflicting the bite, it is difficult if not impossible to determine whether a spider bite occurred, since many conditions of the skin may produce the same symptoms as a spider bite. Streptococcal and Staphylococcal infections, early lesions of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">herpes</a> simplex or zoster, burns, stings or bites from other arthropods or insects (including fleas, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bed_bugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bedbugs</a>, mosquitos, biting flies, ants, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ticks/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ticks</a>), thorn injury, and early <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Lyme disease</a> all may be characterized by skin findings similar to those from a spider bite.</p>.<p>Spiders rarely bite people, and only if threatened. People often thing they have spider bites when the irritation is from another cause.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_spider_bites_dangerous" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most spiders do not have mouth parts strong enough to penetrate human skin, and the majority of spiders found in the U.S. and are actually harmless. There are two notable exceptions, the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider, which are both dangerous to humans. Spider bites are fortunately uncommon. In many cases, presumed spider bites are actually due to another skin condition or an insect sting.</p>.<p>The black widow and brown recluse spiders are more common in the southern states of the U.S. They prefer warm, dry climates and undisturbed areas such as basements, closets, woodpiles, attics, or under sinks. The black widow spider is a small, black, shiny spider with a red hourglass marking on its belly. The brown recluse spider is sometimes termed a "violin spider." It is about an inch long and has a marking resembling a violin on the upper part of its back. Bites from both the black widow and brown recluse spiders are dangerous to humans and require prompt emergency medical care.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_you_do_if_a_spider_bites_you" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_you_do_if_a_black_widow_or_brown_recluse_spider_bites_you" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
