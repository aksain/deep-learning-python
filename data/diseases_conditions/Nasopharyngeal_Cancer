The pharynx is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> (the tube that goes from the throat to the stomach). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or the esophagus. The nostrils lead into the nasopharynx. An opening on each side of the nasopharynx leads into an ear. Nasopharyngeal cancer most commonly starts in the squamous cells that line the nasopharynx.</p>.<p>Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">head and neck cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="ethnic_background_and_being_exposed_to_the_epstein-barr_virus_can_affect_the_risk_of_nasopharyngeal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for nasopharyngeal cancer include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_of_nasopharyngeal_cancer_include_trouble_breathing_speaking_or_hearing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer or by other conditions.

The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_three_ways_that_cancer_spreads_in_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p><b><a name="cancer_may_spread_from_where_it_began_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="the_following_stages_are_used_for_nasopharyngeal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the nasopharynx.

The cancer may come back in the nasopharynx or in other parts of the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_nasopharyngeal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatment are available for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p>Three types of standard treatment are used:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Radiation therapy</a> is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">x-rays</a> or other types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a> to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>.<p>Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer.</p>.<p>External radiation therapy to the thyroid or the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pituitary_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pituitary gland</a> may change the way the thyroid gland works. A blood test to check the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">thyroid hormone</a> level in the blood is done before and after therapy to make sure the thyroid gland is working properly. It is also important that a dentist check the patientâ€™s <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">teeth</a>, gums, and mouth, and fix any existing problems before radiation therapy begins.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Chemotherapy</a> is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy may be given after radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after radiation therapy, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Surgery is a procedure to find out whether cancer is present, to remove cancer from the body, or to repair a body part. Also called an operation. Surgery is sometimes used for nasopharyngeal cancer that does not respond to radiation therapy. If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the doctor may remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck.</p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_by_stage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of stage I nasopharyngeal cancer is usually radiation therapy to the tumor and lymph nodes in the neck.</p>.<p>Treatment of stage II nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage III nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_for_recurrent_nasopharyngeal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:</p>
