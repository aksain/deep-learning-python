<p>Laryngitis is inflammation of the vocal cords located in the larynx or voice box. The larynx is the voice box that allows us to speak, shout, whisper, and sing. The larynx consists of a cartilage skeleton that houses the vocal cords, which are covered by a mucus lining. Muscles inside the larynx adjust the position, shape, and tension of the vocal cords, allowing the voice to make different sounds like whispering, singing, and shouting. Any change in the airflow (which is generated by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> exhaling air) across the vocal cords will affect the voice and the quality of the sound.</p>.<p>The larynx is located at the junction of the mouth and trachea (where air enters the e lungs). There is a flap-like covering called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_body_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">epiglottis</a>, whose job it is to prevent food and saliva from entering the larynx during swallowing.</p>.<p>Laryngitis is an inflammation of the voice box and vocal cords, causing a person to lose their voice and become hoarse. The quality of the voice becomes gravelly-sounding and sometimes too quiet or soft to hear. Because there is inflammation, throat pain is often an associated symptom.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are a number of different causes of acute and chronic laryngitis.</p>.<p>Laryngitis is considered chronic when symptoms last than three weeks, and it may be caused by:</p>.<p>Not all individuals who have lost their voice have an infection. Not all hoarseness is due to a primary inflammation of the vocal cords.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Diphtheria</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pertussis</a> may cause laryngitis-like symptoms, but because most people in the United States have been immunized, these are very uncommon causes. However, with primary immunization decreasing, and people failing to keep their immunizations up to date, there have been a few sporadic outbreaks reported.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b>If the cause of laryngitis is infectious</b>, affected individuals will have symptoms of a viral infection:</p>.<p>In infants and children with croup, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> becomes more difficult. As the child tries to inhale through a swollen and narrow larynx, the cartilage may collapse, just like when attempting to breathe through a straw. As we age, the cartilage becomes stiffer and is able to withstand deeply indrawn breaths, but in children, the cartilage is weaker and with each inspiration, the child may need to work hard to inhale. The maturing of laryngeal cartilage and widening of airways usually occurs by age 6 or 7.</p>.<p>In infants and children with croup, breathing may become more difficult. As the child inhales through a swollen and narrow larynx, the tissues surrounding the upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">airway</a> may collapse, just like when attempting to breathe through a straw. This leads to the classic "seal-like" barky cough associated with croup.</p>.<p>Coup is a viral infection of the upper airways. Symptoms may include:</p>.<p><b>When the cause of laryngitis is not infectious</b>, cough may be a significant symptom along with the hoarseness. There also can be a fullness felt in the throat. The patient also may complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swallowing/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">difficulty swallowing</a> and have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shortness of breath</a>. Rarely, the patient can cough up blood-tinged saliva if the inflammation causes minor bleeding.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Laryngitis is only contagious if it is caused by an infection. Laryngitis, upper respiratory infections, and colds are commonly a contagious viral infection spread by aerosol droplets.</p>.<p>Disease transmission can be minimized or prevented by covering the nose and mouth when coughing and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sneezing</a>, and proper hygiene habits (wash your hands often, don't share food utensils, and wipe down door handles).</p>.<p>Laryngitis is self-limiting and should last for only a few days, and symptoms should resolve within 7 days, but can linger up to two weeks. If symptoms persist longer than three weeks, this is considered chronic laryngitis and causes other than a viral infection need to be explored. Croup is often described as a disease of the nighttime because visits to the emergency department peak after midnight with sick infants and children.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The health-care professional often can make the diagnosis of laryngitis in the doctor's office with little testing required. The history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/upper_respiratory_infection_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">upper respiratory tract infection</a> associated with loss of voice is reinforced by the patient answering questions in a hoarse voice. The examination is often brief and limited to the ears, nose, and throat, looking for other potential causes of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cold/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cold-like symptoms</a>. If the throat is red and there is a concern about a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">streptococcal throat infection</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_throat_gas/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strep throat</a>) a throat swab for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rapid_strep_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">rapid strep test</a> may be ordered.</p>.<p>If the hoarse voice becomes chronic, the health care professional may want to take a more detailed history, trying to learn why the larynx has remained inflamed for such a long time.</p>.<p>The following questions may be asked:</p>.<p>Most cases of laryngitis need no testing to confirm the diagnosis. In those patients with chronic laryngitis, the necessity for blood tests, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> and other diagnostic tests will depend upon the patient presentation and the potential concerns that the health care professional has regarding the cause of the hoarseness.</p>.<p>Laryngoscopy is the most common test performed to look directly at the vocal cords and evaluate their function. This procedure uses a thin tube containing a lighted <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">fiber</a> optic camera that is inserted through the nose into the back of the throat. The health care practitioner performing the procedure can see whether the vocal cords are inflamed, if there are any polyps or nodules growing on them, and if the vocal cords move appropriately with breathing and speaking. This test is often performed by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist), but many other physicians and specialists are trained to perform direct laryngoscopy. Indirect laryngoscopy may be attempted using a mirror placed in the back of the throat to visualize the vocal cords.</p>.<p>Laryngitis most is often first evaluated by a primary care provider including internists, pediatricians, and family medicine specialists. Since most often the illness is self-limited, no further treatment is usually required. When laryngitis persists, otolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist), gastroenterologists, or emergency department doctors may be consulted.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>As with any other structure in the body that becomes inflamed, rest is the key to recovery. For laryngitis, this means resting the voice and limiting the amount of talking. If talking is required, the person should speak in a regular voice and avoid whispering, regardless of how it sounds. Whispering requires the vocal cords to be stretched tightly and requires more work by the surrounding muscles, and this delays recovery time.</p>.<p>Patience is required to allow time for the vocal cords to rest and recover.</p>.<p>The treatment of chronic laryngitis will be determined by the cause of the inflammation or loss of function; however, avoiding alcohol and not smoking will help relieve symptoms in the meantime.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>It is reasonable not to seek medical care for most cases of laryngitis. Home treatment begins with resting the voice and keeping well hydrated. Symptoms may be controlled by exposure to humidified air. Often, the bathroom is the best place to create a highly humidified area.</p>.<p>A cold water vaporizer also may be used to help with humidity. Avoid hot water vaporizers because of the risk of scalding burns.</p>.<p>Stay well hydrated, especially if the pain makes it difficult to swallow fluid.</p>.<p>Warm water gargles may be soothing. Alternatively, popsicles may offer comfort.</p>.<p>Tylenol and/or ibuprofen may be helpful in decreasing the amount of pain.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>If the cause of laryngitis is <b> vocal cord paralysis</b>, the swallowing mechanism may also be affected, and food particles may enter the larynx and lungs, leading to coughing. This process can also lead to aspiration <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a> and its accompanying symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) when the food is aspirated deep into the lungs and causes irritation and inflammation of lung tissue.</p>.<p>Repeated episodes of gastroesophageal reflux may cause small amounts of acid to get past the inflamed larynx and enter the lung, causing recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">pneumonia</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_acute/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bronchitis</a>.</p>.<p>Prior to the advent of <i>Haemophilus</i> <i>influenzae</i> immunization, epiglottitis due to <i>H. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a></i> was always considered as a possible alternative diagnosis for children with croup. This was a life-threatening medical emergency because the epiglottis could massively swell, blocking air from entering the larynx and lungs. X-rays of the neck were taken to visualize the epiglottis and look for swelling. The diagnosis was often confirmed in the operating room where the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist would use laryngoscopy to look at the epiglottis and vocal cords and decide whether to insert a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endotracheal_intubation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breathing tube</a> in the child's airway to prevent the airway from swelling shut. Fortunately, because of immunization, this disease is rarely seen.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
