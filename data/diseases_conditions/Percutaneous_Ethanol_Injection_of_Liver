<p><b><a name="how_is_percutaneous_alcohol_injection_done_and_how_does_it_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In this technique, sterile, 100% alcohol is injected into cancerous growths, or tumors, in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>Â to kill <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> cells. This has worked best against growths comprised of hepatocellular carcinoma or primary liver cancer, but has been tried as well against liver metastases from other types of cancer arising elsewhere (secondary cancers). The alcohol is injected through the skin (percutaneously) into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> using a very thin needle with the help of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> or CT visual guidance. Alcohol causes tumor destruction by drawing water out of tumor cells (dehydrating them) and thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of cellular proteins. It may take up to five or six sessions of injections to completely destroy the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_patients_are_treated_with_percutaneous_alcohol_injection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The ideal patient for alcohol injection has fewer than three Hepatocellular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Carcinoma</a> (HCC) tumors, each of which is:</p>.<p>Additionally, patients with HCC undergoing alcohol injection should have no signs of chronic liver failure, such as free fluid build-up around the liver or in the abdominal cavity (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascites/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ascites</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">jaundice</a>. (Patients with severe liver damage and little remaining normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver function</a> are said to be in liver failure, and would not be able to tolerate the alcohol injections.)</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_side_effects_of_percutaneous_alcohol_injection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common side effect of alcohol injection is leakage of alcohol onto the surface of the liver and into the abdominal cavity, thereby causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>. It is important that the location of the tumor relative to the adjacent blood vessels and bile ducts is clearly identified. The reason for needing to locate these structures is to avoid injuring them during the procedure and causing bleeding, bile duct inflammation, or bile leakage.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
