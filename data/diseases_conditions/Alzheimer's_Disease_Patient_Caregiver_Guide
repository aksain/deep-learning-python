<p><b><a name="tips_for_caregivers_of_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Caring for a person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a> at home is a difficult task and can become overwhelming at times. Each day brings new challenges as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caregiving/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caregiver</a> copes with changing levels of ability and new patterns of behavior. Research has shown that caregivers themselves often are at increased risk for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and illness, especially if they do not receive adequate support from family, friends, and the community. One of the biggest struggles caregivers face is dealing with the difficult behaviors of the person they are caring for. Dressing, bathing, eating—basic activities of daily living—often become difficult to manage for both the person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's</a> and the caregiver. Having a plan for getting through the day can help caregivers cope. Many caregivers have found it helpful to use strategies for dealing with difficult behaviors and stressful situations. Through trial and error you will find that some of the following tips work, while others do not. Each person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's</a> is unique and will respond differently, and each person changes over the course of the disease. Do the best you can, and remind yourself to take breaks. </p>.<p><b><a name="dealing_with_the_diagnosis_of_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Finding out that a loved one has <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a> can be stressful, frightening, and overwhelming. As you begin to take stock of the situation, here are some tips that may help:</p>.<p><b><a name="communicating_with_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Trying to communicate with a person who has Alzheimer's disease can be a challenge. Both understanding and being understood may be difficult.</p>.<p><b><a name="bathing_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While some people with Alzheimer's disease don't mind bathing, for others it is a frightening, confusing experience. Advance planning can help make bath time better for both of you.</p>.<p><b><a name="dressing_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For someone who has Alzheimer's, getting dressed presents a series of challenges: choosing what to wear, getting some clothes off and other clothes on, and struggling with buttons and zippers. Minimizing the challenges may make a difference.</p>.<p><b><a name="eating_getting_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease_to_eat" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eating can be a challenge. Some people with Alzheimer's disease want to eat all the time, while others have to be encouraged to maintain a good <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="activities_for_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>What to do all day? Finding activities that the person with Alzheimer's disease can do and is interested in can be a challenge. Building on current skills generally works better than trying to teach something new.</p>.<p><b><a name="exercise_for_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Incorporating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> into the daily routine has benefits for both the person with Alzheimer's disease and the caregiver. Not only can it improve health, but it also can provide a meaningful activity for both of you to share.</p>.<p><b><a name="incontinence_in_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As the disease progresses, many people with Alzheimer's begin to experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence_in_women_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">incontinence</a>, or the inability to control their bladder and/or bowels. Incontinence can be upsetting to the person and difficult for the caregiver. Sometimes incontinence is due to physical illness, so be sure to discuss it with the person's doctor.</p>.<p><b><a name="sleep_problems_for_caregivers_and_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For the exhausted caregiver, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> can't come too soon. For many people with Alzheimer's disease, however, the approach of nighttime may be a difficult time. Many people with Alzheimer's become restless, agitated, and irritable around dinnertime, often referred to as "sundowning" syndrome. Getting the person to go to bed and stay there may require some advance planning.</p>.<p><b><a name="hallucinations_and_delusions_in_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease may experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hallucinations</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/delusions/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">delusions</a>. Hallucinations are when the person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something that is not there. Delusions are false beliefs that the person thinks are real.</p>.<p><b><a name="wandering_a_problem_for_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Keeping the person safe is one of the most important aspects of caregiving. Some people with Alzheimer's disease have a tendency to wander away from their home or their caregiver. Knowing how to limit wandering can protect a person from getting lost.</p>.<p><b><a name="home_safety_for_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease often have to look at their homes through new eyes to identify and correct safety risks. Creating a safe environment can prevent many stressful and dangerous situations. The ADEAR Center offers the booklet, Home Safety for People with Alzheimer's Disease, which lists many helpful tips. See "For More Information" to contact the ADEAR Center.</p>.<p><b><a name="driving_decisions_for_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Making the decision that a person with Alzheimer's is no longer safe to drive is difficult, and it needs to be communicated carefully and sensitively. Even though the person may be upset by the loss of independence, safety must be the priority.</p>.<p><b><a name="visiting_the_doctor_with_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is important that the person with Alzheimer's disease receive regular medical care. Advance planning can help the trip to the doctor's office go more smoothly.</p>.<p><b><a name="coping_with_holidays_for_caregivers_and_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Holidays are bittersweet for many Alzheimer's disease caregivers. The happy memories of the past contrast with the difficulties of the present, and extra demands on time and energy can seem overwhelming. Finding a balance between rest and activity can help.</p>.<p><b><a name="visiting_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Visitors are important to people with Alzheimer's. They may not always remember who the visitors are, but the human connection has value. Here are some ideas to share with someone who is planning to visit a person with the disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="choosing_a_nursing_home_for_a_person_with_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For many caregivers, there comes a point when they are no longer able to take care of their loved one at home. Choosing a residential care facility—a group home, assisted living facility, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nursing</a> home—is a big decision, and it can be hard to know where to start.</p>.<p><b><a name="for_more_information_on_alzheimers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many organizations offer information for caregivers.
