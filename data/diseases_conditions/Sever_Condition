Sever condition also causes tenderness and swelling in the area of the pain.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_sever_condition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sever condition occurs in adolescent or older children, particularly active boys. It can be very painful.  It is one of those conditions commonly referred to as "growing pains."
