<p><b><a name="anal_itching_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_anal_itching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anal itching (known medically as pruritis ani) is irritation of the skin at the opening of the anal canal through which <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a> exits the body that leads to itching. The skin surrounding the opening is known as the anus. The itching is accompanied by the desire to scratch. Although itching may be a reaction to chemicals in the stool, it often implies that there is inflammation of the anal area. The intensity of anal itching and the amount of inflammation increases with the direct <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> of scratching and the presence of moisture. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is described as burning and soreness.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_anal_itching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Other problems that can cause anal itching include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_additional_symptoms_associated_with_anal_itching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_kind_of_doctor_treats_anal_itching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although anal itching can be evaluated by a family practice or internal medicine physician, it most often is evaluated by a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">colorectal</a> surgeon (proctologist) and sometimes by a gastroenterologist.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_the_cause_of_anal_itching_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anal itching is first evaluated with a careful examination of the anus for such abnormalities as hemorrhoids, fissures, skin tags, moisture, and excoriations (breaks in the skin from scratching).</p>.<p>A rectal examination with a finger inserted into the anal canal can identify rectal tumors. For a closer look at the anal canal, a proctoscope can be used. A proctoscope is a short tube that is inserted through the anus and into the rectum so that the anal canal can be examined visually If pinworms are suspected, they and their eggs can be identified using the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pinworm_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">pinworm test</a>, a test in which the worms and eggs are recovered from the anus using transparent adhesive tape.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_anal_itching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Initial treatment of simple itching is directed toward relieving the burning and soreness. It is important to clean and dry the anus thoroughly and avoid leaving soap in the anal area.</p>.<p>Many over-the-counter (OTC) products are sold for the treatment of anal itching and are available as ointments, creams, gels, suppositories, foams and pads. These products often contain the same <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> used to treat hemorrhoids.</p>.<p>Most products contain more than one type of active ingredient. Almost all contain a protectant in addition to another ingredient. Only examples of brand-name products containing one ingredient in addition to the protectant are discussed in this article.</p>.<p><b><a name="local_anesthetics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Local anesthetics temporarily relieve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a>, burning, and itching by numbing the nerve endings. The use of these products should be limited to the perianal area and lower anal canal. Local anesthetics can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic</a> reactions with burning and itching. Therefore, the application of anesthetics should be discontinued if burning and itching increase.</p>.<p>Examples of local anesthetics include:</p>.<p><b><a name="vasoconstrictors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vasoconstrictors are chemicals such as epinephrine, a naturally occurring chemical. Applied to the anus, vasoconstrictors make the blood vessels become smaller, which may reduce swelling. They also may reduce pain and itching due to their mild anesthetic effect.</p>.<p>Vasoconstrictors applied to the perianal area - unlike vasoconstrictors given by injection - have a low likelihood of causing serious side effects, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high blood pressure</a>, nervousness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tremor</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sleeplessness</a>, and aggravation of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hyperthyroidism</a>.</p>.<p>Examples of vasoconstrictors include:</p>.<p><b><a name="protectants" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Protectants prevent irritation of the perianal area by forming a physical barrier on the skin that prevents contact of the irritated skin with aggravating liquid or stool from the rectum. This barrier reduces irritation, itching, pain, and burning. There are many products that are themselves protectants or that contain a protectant in addition to other medications.</p>.<p>Examples of protectants include:</p>.<p><b><a name="astringents" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Astringents cause coagulation (clumping) of proteins in the cells of the perianal skin or the lining of the anal canal. This action promotes dryness of the skin, which in turn helps relieve burning, itching, and pain.</p>.<p>Examples of astringents include:</p>.<p><b><a name="antiseptics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Antiseptics inhibit the growth of bacteria and other organisms. However, it is unclear whether antiseptics are any more effective than soap and water.</p>.<p>Examples of antiseptics include:</p>.<p><b><a name="keratolytics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Keratolytics are chemicals that cause the outer layers of skin or other tissues to disintegrate. The rationale for their use is that the disintegration allows medications that are applied to the anus and perianal area to penetrate into the deeper tissues.</p>.<p>The two approved keratolytics used are:</p>.<p><b><a name="analgesics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Analgesic products, like anesthetic products, relieve pain, itching, and burning by depressing receptors on pain nerves.</p>.<p>Examples of analgesics include:</p>.<p><b><a name="corticosteroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Corticosteroids</a> reduce inflammation and can relieve itching, but their chronic use can cause permanent damage to the skin. They should not be used for more than short periods of a few days to two weeks. Only products with weak <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroid</a> effects are available over-the-counter. Stronger corticosteroid products that are available by prescription should not be used for treating anal itching.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_anal_itching_persists" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For persistent anal itching, efforts are directed toward identifying an underlying cause. An examination by a doctor can rapidly identify most causes of anal itching. Adjustments in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>, treatment of infections, or surgical procedures to correct the underlying cause may be required.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
