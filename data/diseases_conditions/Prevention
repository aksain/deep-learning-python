Therefore, most dietary recommendations are aimed at preventing these two diseases. Obesity comes over time by eating more calories than the body <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">burns</a>.

Low-energy-dense foods (such as vegetables and fruits) contain few calories per unit volume of food so that one can eat a large volume of it (for example, lettuce) without taking in many calories. One should also eat less of the high-energy-dense foods such as fats, egg yolks, fried foods, sweets, and high-fat salad dressings. Foods with a high energy density also often have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_frequently_asked_questions/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high cholesterol</a> and saturated fat content. One should also eat less of those foods that provide calories but little other nutrients, such as alcohol and many packaged snack foods.</p>.<p>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, published in 2010 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), contains guidelines for healthy diets based upon review of scientific studies for people above 2 years of age.
