It allows waste to be drained. Unlike other ileostomies, the K-pouch or Kock <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis_surgery/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ileostomy</a>, has a valve made by sewing the intestine in a special way so that waste material doesn't leak out but rather a tube called a catheter is inserted when it's time to empty the pouch.</p>.<p>As the pouch fills with intestinal contents (liquids, partly digested food, etc.), pressure builds up on the pouch and its many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stitches</a>. If this is not relieved the pouch could perforate or tear from the excessive stretching or the valve could slip or leak.</p>.<p><b><a name="often" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best way to prevent problems is to drain your K-pouch as instructed by your doctor. How often to drain the pouch varies from person to person but there are some general guidelines. Right after the operation you will have what doctors call an indwelling catheter, meaning that the drainage tube will be left in the pouch to drain continuously. This will last for about three to four weeks to allow the pouch to mature. After the catheter is removed you will drain the pouch several times per day. The number of times you need to drain the pouch each day becomes less over time.</p>.<p>Please discuss you specific needs with your doctor, surgeon, or enterostomal therapist (ET), a nurse who specializes in the care of stomas. Most likely this person will meet or has met with you before the operation and has or will be instructing you on how to take care of your stoma, ostomy, or pouch.</p>.<p><b><a name="guidelines" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned above, please discuss your individual case with your health care providers.

Though you usually make this change after seeing your doctor for the first time after the operation, sometimes your doctor will tell you to start doing the following earlier.
</p>.<p>Over the next several weeks, the time interval between pouch drainages will increase. At night, you may be able to stop the constant drainage and go for longer periods without waking to drain the pouch.</p>.<p>Three months after surgery, there are usually no specific restrictions. Sound practice is to empty the pouch four to six times per day and use irrigation on two of these times. However, any time you feel full, bloated, or distended, drain the pouch. Just as you would empty your bladder before engaging in physical activity or going to bed, so should you empty the continent ileostomy.</p>.<p><b><a name="care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Good skin and catheter care need to be continued after you go home from the hospital.
