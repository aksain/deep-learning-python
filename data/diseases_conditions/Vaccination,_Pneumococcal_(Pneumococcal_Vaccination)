<p><b><a name="what_is_pneumococcal_vaccination" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pneumococcal vaccination is a method of preventing a specific type of lung infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>) that is caused by the pneumococcus (<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Streptococcus</a> pneumoniae</i>) bacterium. There are more than 80 different types of pneumococcus bacteria -- 23 of them covered by the vaccine. The vaccine is injected into the body to stimulate the normal immune system to produce antibodies that are directed against pneumococcus bacteria.</p>.<p>This method of stimulating the normal immune system to be directed against a specific microbe is called immunization. Pneumococcal vaccination is also referred to as pneumococcal immunization.</p>.<p>Pneumococcal vaccination does not protect against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a> caused by microbes other than pneumococcus bacteria, nor does it protect against pneumococcal bacterial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strains</a> not included in the vaccine. It is reassuring to note that of the 80 different serotypes, the vast majority of infections are caused by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine.</p>.<p>In children, especially under 2 years of age, a special conjugated vaccine has been developed to stimulate less developed immune systems. Originally only covering seven serotypes, the newer vaccine released in 2010 now covers 13 serotypes of pneumococcus (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumococcal_pediatric_vaccine-injection/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prevnar 13</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="who_should_consider_pneumococcal_vaccination" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pneumococcal vaccination should be considered by people in the following groups:</p>.<p><b><a name="who_should_not_receive_pneumococcal_vaccine_what_about_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumococcal_vaccine-injection/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumococcal vaccine</a> should not be received by people with a prior history of hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine.</p>.<p>The safety of the pneumococcus vaccine for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. Women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">becoming pregnant</a>, if possible.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_pneumococcal_vaccine_administered" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a single injection in adults. The vaccine is injected as a liquid solution of 0.5 mL into the muscle (intramuscular or IM), typically deltoid muscle, or under the skin (subcutaneous or SC). The area injected is typically disinfected by rubbing alcohol onto the skin prior to the injection. The conjugated Prevnar 13 vaccine is given as a series of four injections in children.</p>.<p>People vaccinated prior to age 65 should be vaccinated at age 65 if five or more years have passed since the first dose. For people with a lack of spleen function (such as in sickle cell disease or after spleen removal), transplant patients, patients with chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney disease</a>, immunosuppressed or immunodeficient people, and others at highest risk of fatal infection, a second dose should be given at least five years after first dose.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_side_effects_of_pneumococcal_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pneumococcal vaccine uncommonly causes side effects.

"Pneumovax is a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) that is currently recommended for use in all adults 65 years of age or older and for persons who are 2 years and older and at high risk for pneumococcal disease (e.g., those with sickle cell disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a> infection, or other immunocompromising conditions).

Those who have already received the PPSV23, should get the PCV13 about one year later. If the person received the PPSV23 over five years earlier, they essentially should be treated as if they never received the vaccine, getting the PCV13 injection, followed about six to 13 months later by the PPSV23.
