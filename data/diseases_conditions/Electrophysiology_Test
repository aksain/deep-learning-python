<p><b><a name="intro" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An electrophysiology (EP) study is a test that records the electrical activity and the electrical pathways of your heart. This test is used to help determine the cause of your heart rhythm disturbance and the best treatment for you. During the EP study, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which one controls it best or to determine the best procedure or device to treat your heart rhythm.</p>.<p><b><a name="test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An electrophysiology study is used:</p>.<p><b><a name="study" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="expect" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The EP study takes about two to four hours to perform.
