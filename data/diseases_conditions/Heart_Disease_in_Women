When this is severe and sudden, this is what is commonly referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">myocardial infarction</a> or a "heart attack." However, years of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery disease</a> typically precede the attack with gradual narrowing and blocking of the blood vessels. The blockages are formed by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lipid</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a> deposits that cause inflammation and form plaques. These plaques calcify, block the vessels, and limit blood flow to the heart muscle. This process is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerosis</a>. The plaques can also rupture, releasing a thrombus or clot that can block blood flow downstream and cause ischemia (decreased oxygen delivery to tissues) elsewhere in the heart or brain.</p>.<p>Because the body was not designed to have high levels of cholesterol (specifically LDL) in the blood, immune cells called macrophages move it into the blood vessel walls to get it out of the circulation. In this process, it becomes oxidized, and this is what triggers the inflammatory process. The macrophages become overwhelmed with the oxidized LDL, try to engulf it, becoming "foam cells." These foam cells trigger the need for further "clean up," and the body tries to sequester the unhealthy foam cells and forms a hard plaque around it. These plaques cause further inflammation within the tissue of the artery wall; this is how atherosclerosis progresses.</p>.<p>There are differences between how atherosclerosis develops in men and women. In general, women are more likely to have plaque formation in a single coronary vessel and in smaller blood vessels. Overall, atherosclerosis or obstructive cardiovascular disease is a less common form of heart disease among women, although when plaques do form, the plaques are comprised of lipid-filled foam cells, which are both more easily treated and reversed. However, the plaques in women are more likely to rupture than <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerotic</a> plaques in men.
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_statistics_for_heart_disease_in_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>One in 3 women die of cardiovascular disease, compared to 1 in 31 women who die of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a>. While the actual numbers of deaths from heart disease have declined among both men and women, more women die of cardiovascular disease each year than men. In fact, rates of heart disease among younger women (aged 35 to 54) are actually increasing, a trend thought to be attributable to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obesity</a>. Rates of heart disease are higher among black women and Hispanic women compared to non-Hispanic Caucasian and Asian women.</p>.<p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women. On average, women develop cardiovascular disease, on average, about 10 years later than men. It is thought that this difference is at least partially due to protective hormonal effects because women's risk increases after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>. Women who undergo early <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause_and_perimenopause_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>, either due to surgical removal of their ovaries or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premature_ovarian_failure_pof/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premature ovarian failure</a>, have similar rates of cardiovascular disease as age-matched men. Most women have one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_gender_differences" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are notable differences in the types of heart disease that affect men and women. Differences exist in the underlying mechanisms of their heart disease, the symptoms that they present, and the types of complications they experience. There are also differences in the comprehensiveness of the medical care men and women receive and the general awareness of the magnitude of women's cardiovascular risk compared to that of men.</p>.<p>Researchers who study the gender differences in cardiovascular disease often focus on the protective role of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogen</a>. Estrogen has numerous effects on vascular tissue. It relaxes blood vessels, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lowering_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lowering blood pressure</a> (pre-menopausally). Estrogen blunts the effects of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> hormones (catecholamines) which are vasoactive and cause blood vessel constriction, especially in times of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>. Estrogen is also a natural <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat-fighting_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antioxidant</a>. However, estrogen also promotes blood coagulation, which isn't helpful. This is why women who use <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">oral contraceptives</a> are at an increased risk of thrombotic events (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a>). The use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hormone replacement therapy</a> containing conjugated equine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogens</a>, once thought to protect women against cardiovascular disease, is now known to increase CVD.</p>.<p>Several types of heart disease are more common in women than in men: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>, endothelial dysfunction, and congestive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart failure</a>. Because the presentation of these diseases is often less symptomatic, both women and their doctors benefit from efforts to increase awareness and practice prevention to reduce cardiovascular disease.</p>.<p>While men and women have similar rates of hospitalization due to heart disease, women tend to have longer hospital stays, receive less of the recommended assessment and treatment, and experience greater long-term disability. Women are less likely to return to work following a CVD-related hospital admission and have lower health-related quality of life following an event. These are important reasons for women to be well educated about what they can do to prevent heart disease and the types of treatment that should be recommended if they do have heart disease. With this knowledge, women can advocate for their own best health care.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_heart_disease_risk_factors_for_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are lifestyle behaviors. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diet</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tobacco</a> use, alcohol consumption, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">overweight</a>, psychosocial stress, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> are all significant risk factors. The good news is that these factors are largely modifiable.</p>.<p>Medical conditions such as obesity, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_frequently_asked_questions/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high cholesterol</a> also increase women's risk of heart disease. Women are more likely than men to have multiple risk factors. Women also have higher risks of mortality (death) when they have multiple conditions; for example, women with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> have an increased risk of dying of cardiovascular disease compared to men with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>. Additional risk factors specific to women include oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contraceptive</a> use, hormone replacement therapy, and history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_preeclampsia_and_eclampsia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">preeclampsia</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gestational_diabetes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gestational diabetes</a> during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>.</p>.<p>Risk factors are very common in women and, in fact, women are also less likely to experience a heart attack or present with symptoms without at least one traditional risk factor. This suggests that if women and their doctors pay attention and treat early risk factors, heart attacks could be avoided.</p>.<p>Many risk factors can be easily identified through routine testing and review of lifestyle habits. Unfortunately, women are less likely to receive a comprehensive evaluation, even when they present to their doctor or hospital with symptoms. While simply improving the rates of basic assessment to equal the frequency of evaluation in men will improve CVD detection and prevention for women, in order to most accurately assess risk in women, different factors should considered in addition to the traditional markers of risk. This is because of the differences in the underlying types of CVD that affect women, and thus testing and screening should seek to identify those types of cardiovascular disease that a woman is most likely to have.
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="lifestyle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dietary risk factors specifically include overconsumption of unhealthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat_and_fats_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fats</a> (saturated fat and trans fatty acids) and underconsumption of good fats (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mono</a> unsaturated fats, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">omega-3 fatty acids</a>) and fruits and vegetables (see below for information on what to eat to prevent and reverse CVD).

For example, a 60-year-old woman should be able to achieve 85% of her target heart rate (136 bpm) during a vigorous exercise session and should be able to recover her heart rate down to at least 124 bpm within 1 minute. If she cannot, she is below her predicted exercise capacity and at increased risk. (See below for information on how much activity is necessary to prevent and reverse CVD).</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Smoking</a> is a substantial risk factor.

Additionally, exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/secondhand_smoke/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">secondhand smoke</a> and environmental particulate (such as pollution) are known risk factors. Women who smoke should seek help to quit.</p>.<p>Psychosocial risk factors were first measured and quantified by the INTERHEART study, a large international study of CVD risk factors among men and women.

While epidemiologists classically described marriage as a heart protective factor, this benefit is only seen for men; no differences in heart disease have been observed among married and non-married women. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Depression</a> is more prevalent in women and is a significant risk factor for both genders. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Depression</a> appears to directly increase CVD risk and also impacts women's success in adopting and sticking with healthy lifestyle behaviors. (See below for information on how to reduce stress-related CVD risk factors).</p>.<p>Personality traits can also contribute to CVD risk. Research has shown that Type A personality characteristics, such as competitive ambition, time urgency, and hostility all increase rates of CVD. A high locus of control or sense of being able to handle things is protective. Other factors, such as negative emotional states, having a fighting spirit, stoic acceptance or fatalism, or active coping mechanisms demonstrate a more complicated relationship with heart disease, likely modified by the other risk factors discussed previously.</p>.<p>Being overweight or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obese</a> is also a CVD risk factor.

Preeclampsia, a condition of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_induced_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure in pregnancy</a>, doubles the risk for cardiovascular events over the 5 to 15 years after pregnancy. </p>.<p>Inflammation is at the root of atherosclerosis and most forms of cardiovascular disease. There are many biomarkers of inflammation that can help doctors differentiate the origin of the inflammation (such as whether it is coming from the inner lining of the arteries or from immune cell activity). American Heart Association guidelines recommend testing biomarkers of inflammation when the level of risk is uncertain. Because of the differences in the origins of heart disease in women, understanding inflammation and the resulting oxidative stress is important. </p>.<p>Inflammation can be measured with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Several studies have demonstrated that hs-CRP is an independent risk factor for heart disease. That is, it adds information about someone's risk in addition to the information provided by cholesterol measurement, blood pressure, or any of the other risk factors that have been discussed. Increased hs-CRP may indicate a doubling of risk that can be identified only if this biomarker is measured. Other biomarkers of inflammation exist and can add precision to the doctor's assessment of where the source of inflammation is located; these are discussed in the laboratory testing section of this article.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_heart_disease_risk_calculated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk classification has historically been calculated using the Framingham Risk Score. Based on the presence of risk factors, the likelihood of having a cardiovascular event within the next 10 years can be calculated and thus doctors can compute "how worried" they should be about someone at risk for a cardiovascular event. However, the Framingham score underestimates risk among women and is limited in estimating only the likelihood of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery disease</a>, not all forms of cardiovascular disease. Because of this, an alternative tool, the Reynolds risk score, may be more appropriate for women. Risk can be calculated at <a href="http://www.ReynoldsRiskScore.org" target="_blank" onclick="popupWarning();">www.ReynoldsRiskScore.org</a> (see table for risk factors included in the calculation).

Thus it is particularly important for health care professionals to recognize risk factors, for women to be screened, and for everyone to follow lifestyle patterns known to prevent disease.</p>.<p>Heart disease results when the risk factors discussed previously cause maladaptive changes in the heart and blood vessels. For example, chronic high blood pressure increases the stress on the blood vessels and increases the turbulence of blood flow which leads to vascular inflammation and plaque deposits. A clot or narrowed artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching the muscle downstream, leading to ischemia or damage to the heart muscle. Weak or damaged heart muscle cannot pump efficiently which leads to an enlarged, inefficient heart or congestive heart failure. Electrical signals don't pass through damaged tissue very well either, leading to arrhythmias. When any of these conditions occur due to the presence of risk factors, disease is likely to progress, although the specific patterns differ among men and women.</p>.<p>Women are less likely than men to have obstructive or ischemic causes of heart disease. In women, when they do experience ischemic heart disease, it is more likely to affect small vessels. CVD in women is more likely to involve microvascular disease, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. In these conditions, small blood vessels and the linings of the vessels are affected. This is often asymptomatic, but over time it can lead to angina, vasospasm (spasm of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary arteries</a>), stroke, and many of the other forms of heart disease that have been discussed. Women also have more coagulative disorders, possibly due to the role of estrogen.

If women notice these symptoms, they should seek evaluation.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_a_heart_attack_in_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Highly concerning is a recent national survey by the American Heart Association that reported that only 53% of women said the first thing they would do if they thought they were having a heart attack was to call 9-1-1! On average, women have a 4-hour delay in seeking treatment when they are having a heart attack. A time delay of 4 hours can mean the difference between getting life-saving treatment or not.</p>.<p>Heart attack symptoms can be similar to the symptoms women experience with angina, but they do not resolve with rest. Chest pain and pain radiating into the left arm are classic, but lesser known symptoms can include:</p>.<p>Don't ignore these symptoms in yourself or in a woman you love!  
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Strokes are sometimes called brain attacks because the causes are very similar to the causes of heart attack -- a clot in or rupture of a blood vessel and damage to the tissue downstream from the site of injury. In the case of a stroke, the symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected; thus strokes can affect speech, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a>, vision, movement, sensations, or other functions. Common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke symptoms</a> begin quite suddenly and can include:</p>.<p>Women also report unique symptoms:</p>.<p>The American Stroke Association has initiated the F-A-S-T campaign to help people identify possible stroke and call 9-1-1 quickly. F-A-S-T stands for:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_heart_disease_in_women_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women are less likely to get thorough cardiac assessment or treatment when they present to their doctors or hospital for care, so it is especially important for women to understand what may be involved in evaluation so they can be advocates for themselves. As discussed previously, women can evaluate their own risk factors using the Reynolds Risk Score. This tool is more sensitive in catching heart disease in women. Women can complete their own scores and bring their results to their doctor.</p>.<p>Evaluation of CVD may include the following tests:</p>.<p><b><a name="imaging_studies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Imaging studies provide information on blood flow in addition to the size and function of the heart muscle. Image-assisted stress tests such as a stress <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">echocardiogram</a> or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide more diagnostic detail than static tests. Because women tend to have coronary artery disease that affects only one vessel, it may be harder to detect cardiovascular disease in women with imaging tests.</p>.<p><b><a name="invasive_testing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiac_catheterization/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cardiac catheterization</a>/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angiogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary angiogram</a> is the most accurate way CAD can be evaluated; however, it is an invasive test with some risk. In this test, a small tube is threaded through the arteries to the heart where a small amount of dye is released and viewed with X-ray. The person is sedated and local anesthetic is used. From this test, doctors can determine how well blood is flowing through the arteries in the heart wall. One of the advantages of a coronary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angiogram</a> is that therapeutic procedures (an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angioplasty</a>) can be immediately performed when a blockage is found (more on this below).</p>.<p><b><a name="laboratory_testing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When a woman is suspected of having a heart attack, additional tests are run in the hospital to determine if her heart tissue has been damaged. These tests include:</p>.<p>
Cardiac biomarkers like BNP and CRP are better predictors of ischemic events in women as opposed to the routinely checked CKMB and troponins, which do not rise to such high levels in women as in men. Some cardiovascular specialty labs are also <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">running</a> highly sensitive tests that measure very small amounts of these same substances, and some doctors are using these in hope of detecting very mild ischemia and heart muscle damage that precedes a full heart attack.
