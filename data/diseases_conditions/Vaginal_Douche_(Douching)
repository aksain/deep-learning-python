<p><b><a name="what_is_vaginal_douching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Douching is the practice of washing or flushing the vagina with water or 
other fluids. Vaginal douches are available as prepackaged mixes, most commonly 
involving water mixed with vinegar, baking soda, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iodine_strong-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">iodine</a>. Douches are 
available at pharmacies and supermarkets.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_vaginal_douching_necessary" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends 
that women avoid the practice of vaginal douching. Most physicians also do not 
recommend douching. Douching can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina 
and can alter the normal pH of the vagina. Changes in the composition of the 
bacteria that normally reside within the vagina can lead to an increased risk of 
vaginal infections such as yeast infections. Douching can also cause the spread 
of harmful bacteria further up into the reproductive tract if an infection is 
already present in the vagina. </p>.<p>Women who douche state that they do so because they believe it offers health 
benefits, such as cleaning the vagina, rinsing away blood after menstrual 
periods, avoiding odor, and preventing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> or infections. However, these 
beliefs are false, and douching is not necessary to “clean” the vagina. Douching 
also does not protect against pregnancy or against sexually-transmitted diseases 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexually_transmitted_diseases_stds_in_women/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">STDs</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_douching_be_harmful" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, in some women, douching can lead to the spread of an infection or even 
the development of an infection by altering the balance of normal bacteria that 
are present in the vagina, as discussed previously. The risk of both 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_vaginosis_causes_symptoms_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bacterial vaginosis</a> and sexually-transmitted diseases may be increased by douching. 
Douching can also cause vaginal irritation.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_best_way_to_clean_the_vagina" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The vagina produces mucus, which acts as a natural cleansing agent to wash 
away blood, semen, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal discharge</a>. Washing the outside of the vagina with 
mild soap and water with regular bathing is sufficient for good hygiene.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_douching_help_relieve_vaginal_discharge_odor_pain_itching_or_burning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_vaginosis_causes_symptoms_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal odor</a>, discharge, or discomfort can signal the presence of 
an infection, so douching to relieve the symptom would only avoid the underlying 
problem and might even make the infection worse. If you have abnormal vaginal 
odor or discharge, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_pain" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, burning, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a>, it's important to see your 
health-care professional for diagnosis and treatment. Douching before the 
doctor's visit can make it more difficult to diagnose the problem and recommend 
the right therapy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_douching_after_sex_prevent_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No, douching after sex does not prevent pregnancy and should never be used as
