<p><b><a name="nosebleed_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_nosebleeds" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The nose is a part of the body rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is located in a vulnerable position protruding on the face. As a result, trauma to the face can cause nasal injury and bleeding. The bleeding may be profuse, or simply a minor complication. Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out and crack. This is common in dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is dry and warm from household heaters. People are more susceptible to a bloody nose if they take medications that prevent normal blood clotting (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">warfarin</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Coumadin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Jantoven</a>], clopidogrel [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clopidogrel/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Plavix</a>], aspirin, or any anti-inflammatory medication). In this situation, even a minor trauma could result in significant bleeding.</p>.<p>The incidence of nosebleeds is higher during the colder winter months when upper respiratory infections are more frequent, and the temperature and humidity fluctuate more dramatically. In addition, changes from a bitter cold outside environment to a warm, dry, heated home result in drying and changes in the nose which make it more susceptible to bleeding. Nosebleeds also occur in hot, dry climates with low humidity, or when there is a change in the seasons. The following risk factors predispose people to nosebleeds:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_stop_the_common_nosebleed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people who develop nose bleeding can handle the problem without the need of a treatment by a health-care professional if they follow the step-by-step <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">first aid</a> recommendations below on how to stop a nosebleed:</p>.<p>Stuffing cotton or tissue into your nose is not recommended.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_prevent_the_nose_from_bleeding_again" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_a_person_has_frequent_or_chronic_nosebleeds" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If a nosebleed recurs four times or more in a week, see a health-care professional to determine why this is occurring. Frequent or chronic nosebleeds may be caused by many factors including</p>.<p>If the nosebleed persists or is recurrent, see your health-care professional who may recommend stopping the nosebleed with a heating instrument or chemical swab (cautery of the blood vessel that is causing the trouble), or application of a topical medicine called thrombin that promotes local clotting of blood. Blood tests may be ordered to check for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">bleeding disorders</a>. If bleeding is still persistent, the doctor may place nasal packs, which compress the vessels and stop the bleeding. In rare situations, you may be admitted to the hospital or require surgical treatment or a procedure where material is used to plug up the bleeding vessels in the nose (angiographic embolization).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_remedies_or_medications_can_you_take_to_prevent_nosebleeds" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common cause of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bloody_nose/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nosebleeds</a> is drying of the nasal membranes. If a person is prone to recurrent or frequent nosebleeds, it is often helpful to lubricate the nose with an ointment of some type. The ointment can be applied gently with a Q-tip or fingertip up inside the nose, especially on the middle portion (the septum).</p>.<p>Many people use remedies for nosebleeds such as</p>.<p>Nosebleeds in children may be prevented by ensuring children do not pick their nose.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_you_call_your_doctor_%0Aor_go_to_an_emergency_room_for_a_nosebleed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_the_doctor_places_nasal_packs_in_my_nostrils" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nasal packs are used when less conservative measures fail. These packs are frequently placed in both sides of the nose. The packs are usually made of a material called "Merocel" which is a compressed sponge-like material or a gel gauze-wrapped balloon (called a "Rhino Rocket") used to help compress the area of the nose that is bleeding. The doctor usually leaves them in for several days. This requires a follow-up appointment so your doctor can remove the packs.</p>.<p>The patient will need someone to drive them and bring them home after the nasal packs are removed. During this time, the patient may be prescribed antibiotics and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> medication as needed.</p>.<p>It is not uncommon for the nose to drain a blood-tinged material. Folded gauze taped under the nose (a mustache dressing) is often useful. The doctor may permit the patient to clean the nostrils with hydrogen peroxide soaked Q-tips. Prevention methods described previously should be considered to help to avoid bleeding again.</p>.<p>Patients with nosebleeds should not take aspirin or any other blood thinning products. If patients are already taking these medications when the nosebleed is noticed, they should notify their doctor.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--><span id="cntid"></span></p>
