The back of the knee is also referred to as the popliteal area of the knee. A Baker's cyst is sometimes referred to as a popliteal cyst. When an excess of knee joint fluid is compressed by the body weight between the bones of the knee joint, it can become trapped and separate from the joint to form the fluid-filled sac of a Baker's cyst. The name of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cyst</a> is in memory of the physician who originally described the condition, the British surgeon William Morrant Baker (1839-1896).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Baker's cysts are not uncommon and can be caused by virtually any cause of joint swelling (arthritis). The excess joint fluid (synovial fluid) bulges to the back of the knee to form the Baker's cyst. The most common type of arthritis associated with Baker's cysts is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a>, also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">degenerative arthritis</a>. Baker's cysts can occur in children with juvenile arthritis of the knee. Baker's cysts also can result from cartilage tears (such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/torn_meniscus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">torn meniscus</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, and other knee problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for a Baker's cyst include a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/torn_meniscus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">torn meniscus</a>, arthritis, and knee joint injury.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A Baker's cyst may cause no symptoms or be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/knee_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">knee pain</a> and/or tightness, and stiffness behind the knee, especially when the knee is extended or fully flexed. Baker's cysts are usually visible as a bulge behind the knee that is particularly noticeable on standing and when compared to the opposite uninvolved knee. They are generally soft and minimally tender.</p>.<p>Baker's cysts can become complicated by spread of fluid down the leg between the muscles of the calf (dissection). The cyst can rupture, leaking fluid down the inner leg to sometimes cause the appearance of a painless bruise under the inner ankle. Baker's cyst dissection and rupture are frequently associated with swelling of the leg and can mimic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phlebitis_and_thrombophlebitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">phlebitis</a> of the leg. A ruptured Baker's cyst typically causes rapid-onset swelling of the leg with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a> around the ankle.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_treat_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors who treat Baker's cysts include general primary-care physicians, orthopedists, and rheumatologists.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_do_doctors_use_to_diagnose_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Baker's cysts can be diagnosed by the doctor's examination and confirmed by imaging tests (either <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>, injection of contrast dye into the knee followed by imaging, called an arthrogram, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> scan) if necessary.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Baker's cysts often resolve with aspiration (removal) of excess knee fluid in conjunction with cortisone injection. Medications are sometimes given to relieve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> and inflammation.</p>.<p>When cartilage tears or other internal knee problems are associated, physical therapy or surgery can be the best treatment option. During a surgical operation, the surgeon can remove the swollen tissue (synovium) that leads to the cyst formation. This is most commonly done with arthroscopic surgery. Physical therapy is often done in the recovery period.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_recovery_time_after_treatment_of_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recovery time depends on the form of treatment rendered. With medications or injections into the knee, recovery can be rapid, within days to weeks. If surgical repair is done, recovery generally takes one to three months.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_home_remedies_for_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Home remedies, prior to medical evaluation, include cold applications, resting, and avoiding overuse or injury to the involved knee.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_potential_complications_of_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications of a Baker's cyst include blood clotting in the involved leg, as well as rupture of the Baker's cyst, causing swelling and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> of the leg and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/easy_bruising/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bruising</a> discoloration of the ankle.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_baker#39s_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending on the cause of the Baker's cyst, the outlook is generally very good.
