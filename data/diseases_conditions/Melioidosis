The bacteria are found in contaminated water and soil and spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source. The bacteria are also of some concern as a potential agent for biological warfare and biological terrorism.</p>.<p>Melioidosis is similar to glanders disease, which is passed to humans from infected domestic animals.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_melioidosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for developing melioidosis infection include</p>.<p>Other possible risk factors that may contribute to infection with melioidosis include steroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, rheumatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">congestive heart failure</a>, pulmonary hemosiderosis, chronic granulomatous disease, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_signs_and_symptoms_of_melioidosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several different types of melioidosis, each with its own signs and symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_melioidosis_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Melioidosis is minimally <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a>. It can be spread from person to person, though it is rare. The most common route of infection with melioidosis is through direct contact with contaminated soil and water, especially though open wounds on the skin. Humans and animals can also acquire the infection by inhaling dust particles or water droplets or ingesting water that is contaminated.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_treat_melioidosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary-care providers (PCPs), such as family practitioners, internists, pediatricians, and emergency-medicine specialists may initially treat patients, but individuals with severe complications may be treated by infectious-disease specialists or critical-care specialists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health-care_professionals_diagnose_melioidosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of melioidosis is made with a microscopic evaluation of a blood, urine, sputum, or skin-lesion sample in the laboratory. A blood test is useful to detect early acute cases of melioidosis, but it cannot exclude the illness if it is negative.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_incubation_period_for_melioidosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The incubation period for melioidosis ranges from one to 21 days, with an average of nine days to onset of infection. Symptoms typically appear two to four weeks after exposure.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_does_melioidosis_occur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Melioidosis is most frequently reported in southeast Asia, northern Australia, south Asia (including India), and China. The majority of patients are from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and northern Australia. Melioidosis has also been reported in Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia. The bacterium that causes the disease is found in the soil, rice paddies, and stagnant waters of the area. People acquire the disease by inhaling dust contaminated by the bacteria and when the contaminated soil comes in contact with abraded (scraped) area of the skin. Infection most commonly occurs during the rainy season.</p>.<p>In the United States, confirmed cases range from none to five each year and occur among travelers and immigrants, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_melioidosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of melioidosis involves antibiotics and depends on the location of the disease.</p>.<p>For patients with more mild illness, the CDC recommends medication with antibiotics such as imipenem, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/meropenem-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">meropenem</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/meropenem-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Merrem</a>), penicillin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxycycline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">doxycycline</a> (Doryx, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxycycline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Oracea</a>, Monodox), <span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_40"><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amoxicillin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">amoxicillin</a>-clavulanic acid (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amoxicillin_and_clavulanic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Augmentin</a>, Augmentin XR), ceftazidime (Fortaz, Tazicef), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ticarcillin_and_clavulanate_potassium/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Timentin</a>), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), and aztreonam (Cayston, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aztreonam-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Azactam</a>).
