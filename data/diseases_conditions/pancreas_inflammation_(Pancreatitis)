<p>Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas.</p>.<p>Pancreatitis is categorized as being either acute or chronic.</p>.<p>Pancreatitis is a condition that may be mild and self-limiting, though it can also lead to severe complications that can be life-threatening. The acute form of pancreatitis, in its most severe form, can have deleterious effects on many other body organs, including the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> and kidneys.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Pancreatitis causes upper abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> which can range from mild to severe.</p>.<p>The pain may come on suddenly or it may develop gradually. Often, the pain will start or worsen after eating, which can also occur with gallbladder or ulcer pain. Abdominal pain tends to be the hallmark of acute pancreatitis. People with acute pancreatitis usually feel very ill.</p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis may include:</p>.<p>In chronic pancreatitis, abdominal pain also can be present, but it is often not as severe, and some people may not have any pain at all.</p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis may include:</p>.<p>Normally, digestive enzymes released by the pancreas are not activated to break down fats and proteins until they reach the small intestine. However, when these digestive enzymes are activated while still in the pancreas, inflammation and local damage to the pancreas occurs leading to pancreatitis.</p>.<p>The causes of pancreatitis include:</p>.<p>Alcohol consumption and gallstones account for over 80% of all cases of pancreatitis in the US.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are a number of tests that alone, or in combination, will help establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis.</p>.<p>Amylase and/or lipase levels are typically elevated in cases of acute pancreatitis. These blood tests may not be elevated in cases of chronic pancreatitis. These are usually the first tests performed to establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis, as these results are generally readily and quickly available. Other blood tests may be ordered, for example:</p>.<p>A CT (computed tomography) scan of the abdomen may be ordered to visualize the pancreas and to evaluate the extent of inflammation, as well as any of the potential complications that can arise from pancreatitis, such as bleeding or pseudocyst (a collection of fluid) formation. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> may also detect gallstones (a major cause of pancreatitis) and other abnormalities of the biliary system.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Ultrasound</a> imaging can be used to look for gallstones and abnormalities of the biliary system. Because ultrasound imaging does not emit <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a>, this modality is frequently the initial imaging test obtained in cases of pancreatitis.</p>.<p>Depending on the underlying cause of pancreatitis and the severity of illness, additional testing may be ordered.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>In most cases of acute pancreatitis, admission to the hospital is needed, whereas some cases of chronic pancreatitis can be managed in an outpatient setting.</p>.<p>Depending on the underlying cause of pancreatitis, management may vary to address the specific cause. In general, however, the following treatment regimen will always be initiated for the treatment of pancreatitis.</p>.<p>First-line treatment will involve:</p>.<p>If pancreatitis is due to an obstructing gallstone, surgical intervention may be required to remove the gallstone and/or remove the gallbladder. Intervention may also be required to treat a pseudocyst or to remove part of the affected pancreas.</p>.<p>If alcohol consumption is the cause of pancreatitis, abstinence from alcohol and an alcohol rehabilitation program will be recommended.</p>.<p>If a medication or chemical exposure is found to be the cause of pancreatitis, then removal of the medication or offending exposure is recommended.</p>.<p>If high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/triglyceride_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">triglycerides</a> are the cause of pancreatitis, then your health-care professional may prescribe medication to decrease the patient's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/how_to_lower_triglycerides_naturally/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">triglyceride levels</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>In general, the above treatment regimen is the mainstay of pancreatitis management.</p>.<p>Pain medication and medication to control nausea may also be prescribed.</p>.<p>In cases of chronic pancreatitis, your health-care professional also may prescribe pancreatic enzyme <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a> in order to help the body digest certain nutrients.</p>.<p>For people with pancreatitis, low-fat meals that are high in nutrients is the recommended <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>. Adequate fluid intake is also recommended to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Pancreatitis can be a life-threatening illness with severe complications. Complications may include:</p>.<p>The prognosis for pancreatitis depends on many different factors, such as the underlying condition causing pancreatitis, the severity of the pancreatitis, and the patient's age and underlying medical problems. Patients with pancreatitis can experience everything from a brief self-limited illness with a full recovery to severe course of illness that can lead to life-threatening complications and death. If an individual has repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, they may develop chronic pancreatitis, a lifelong condition that can lead to a decreased quality of life.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
