<p><b><a name="who_needs_a_mouth_guard" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mouth guards should be used by <nobr>anyone -- both</nobr> children and <nobr>adults -- who</nobr> play
contact sports such as football, boxing, soccer, ice hockey, basketball,
lacrosse, and field hockey. However, even those participating in noncontact
sports (for example, gymnastics) and any recreational activity (for example,
skateboarding, mountain biking) that might pose a risk of injury to the mouth
would benefit from wearing a protective mouth guard.</p>.<p>Adults and children who grind their teeth at night should have a nocturnal
bite plate or bite splint made to prevent tooth damage.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="why_use_a_mouth_guard_when_playing_sports" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because accidents can happen during any physical activity, the advantage of using a mouth guard is that it can help limit the risk of mouth-related injuries to your lips, tongue, and soft tissues of your mouth. Mouth guards also help you avoid chipped or broken teeth, nerve damage to a tooth or even tooth loss.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_i_wear_a_mouth_guard_if_i_wear_braces" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Since an injury to the face could damage orthodontic brackets or other
fixed appliances, a properly fitted mouth guard may be particularly important
for people who wear <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/orthodontics_braces_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">braces</a> or have fixed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bridge</a> work. Your dentist or
orthodontist can determine the mouth guard that will provide the best
protection for your unique mouth work. An important reminder: do not wear any
