 Charles P. Davis, MD, PhD</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_fish_odor_syndrome_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Trimethylaminuria is a disorder in which the body is unable to break down 
trimethylamine, a compound derived from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> that has a strong odor of 
rotting fish. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_fish_odor_syndrome_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As trimethylamine builds up in the body, it causes affected people 
to give off a fish-like odor in their sweat, urine, and 
breath. The intensity of 
this odor may vary over time. The strong body odor can interfere with many 
aspects of daily life, affecting a person's relationships, social life, and 
career. Some people with trimethylaminuria experience
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and social 
isolation as a result of this condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_fish_odor_syndrome_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although gene mutations account for most cases of trimethylaminuria, the 
condition can also be caused by other factors. A fish-like body odor may result 
from an excess of certain proteins in the diet or from an increase in bacteria 
that normally produce trimethylamine in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">digestive system</a>. A few cases of the 
disorder have been identified in adults with 
liver or kidney disease. Temporary 
symptoms of this condition have been reported in a small number of premature 
infants and in some healthy women at the start of
menstruation.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_fish_odor_syndrome_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Trimethylaminuria is an uncommon <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">genetic disorder</a>; its incidence is unknown.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_genes_are_related_to_fish_odor_syndrome_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mutations in the <i>FMO</i>3 gene cause trimethylaminuria.</p>.<p>The FMO3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that breaks down 
nitrogen-containing compounds from the diet, including trimethylamine. This 
compound is produced by bacteria in the intestine as they help digest proteins 
from eggs, liver, legumes (such as soybeans and peas), certain kinds of fish, 
and other foods. Normally, the <i>FMO3</i> enzyme converts fishy-smelling 
trimethylamine into another molecule that has no odor. If the enzyme is missing 
or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the <i>FMO3</i> gene, 
trimethylamine is not processed properly and can build up in the body. As excess 
trimethylamine is released in a person's sweat, urine, and breath, it causes the 
strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Researchers believe that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> 
and diet also play a role in triggering symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_inherit_fish_odor_syndrome_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most cases of trimethylaminuria appear to be 
inherited in an autosomal 
recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have 
mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive 
condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but typically do not show 
signs and symptoms of the condition. Carriers of an <i>FMO3</i> mutation, however, may 
have mild symptoms of trimethylaminuria or experience temporary episodes of 
fish-like body odor.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_information_about_diagnosis_management_or_treatment_of_trimethylaminuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These resources address the diagnosis or management of trimethylaminuria and
