The pain may originate from the testicle itself, or it may be the result of other conditions affecting the scrotum, groin, or abdomen. Though there are numerous medical conditions that can cause testicular pain, it is important to understand that a few of them constitute medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention in order to prevent impairment or loss of testicular function. Testicular pain can be an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) condition. The testicular pain may be constant or intermittent.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_testicular_pain_what_are_other_symptoms_of_pain_in_the_testicles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many diseases and other health problems can cause pain in one or both testicles. Testicular pain along with other symptoms and signs vary depending on the underlying cause. However, often times the symptoms can be very similar between the various causes, making it difficult to distinguish among the conditions which require urgent medical attention. <b>Therefore, if you experience testicular pain, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. </b></p>.<p><b><a name="testicular_torsion_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Testicular torsion typically occurs because of an anomaly affecting the normal attachment of the testicle within the scrotum, often referred to as the "bell clapper" deformity. This abnormality allows the testicle to be freely suspended and twist spontaneously. Often times, this anomaly is present in both testicles. Trauma to the testicle is a rare cause of testicular torsion.</p>.<p>Testicular torsion is most common in males younger than 30 years of age, with a peak incidence between 12-18 years of age. It can also occur more frequently during the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">neonatal</a> period. Testicular torsion most often affects the left testicle, and it is the most common cause of testicle loss in adolescent males.</p>.<p>Testicular torsion generally comes on suddenly. Severe testicle pain that only felt in one testicle may also have these signs and symptoms:</p>.<p><b><a name="epididymitis_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Epididymis occurs when there is inflammation of the epididymis (a structure within the scrotum. Generally, the condition is result of an infection. Epididymitis primarily affects adult men, and is most common between the ages of 19 to 40 years; however, it can occur in prepubescent boys and elderly men.</p>.<p>Sexually transmitted diseases or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexually_transmitted_diseases_stds_in_women/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">STDs</a> are the most common cause of epididymitis In sexually active men., most commonly caused by the bacteria <em><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Chlamydia trachomatis</a></em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. In younger and older males, the infection usually is caused by bacteria that are found in the urinary tract, such as <em><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Escherichia coli</a> </em>(<em><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli</a></em>). Infection in these age groups is typically the result of an abnormality within the genitourinary system.</p>.<p>Epididymitis comes on gradually.The testicular pain can be mild, moderate, or severe, and that is only in one testicle also may have symptoms and signs including:</p>.<p><b><a name="inguinal_hernia_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An inguinal hernia is a bulge or protrusion of intestine through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature of the groin area. This protrusion can sometimes cause swelling of the scrotum and subsequent testicular pain.</p>.<p>Inguinal hernias are common and they can sometimes cause discomfort in the scrotum and/or testicles. Signs and symptoms of an inguinal hernia may include a:</p>.<p><b><a name="testicular_tumor_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generally, testicular tumors don't cause pain; however, occasionally some tumors can cause pain and discomfort of the testicle or scrotum. Signs and symptoms of a tumor in a testicle may include a:</p>.<p><b><a name="orchitis_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Orchitis is a sign of inflammation of a testicle, usually because of an infection, for example, the mumps, the most common cause of the condition. Usually, mumps orchitis occurs in males who have not reached <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a>; however, there has been an increase in cases in boys who have gone through puberty and adolescents males, secondary to the decreased use of the mumps <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a>. Rarely, orchitis can be caused by a bacterial infection that, usually, is the result of progression of epididymitis (epididymo-orchitis).</p>.<p>Because orchitis generally occurs as a consequence of an infection (most often mumps), it is typically also accompanied by other systemic infectious symptoms. Testicular pain may range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of orchitis may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="trauma_and_injury_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Trauma or injury of any type to the testicles can cause severe pain and discomfort. Blunt testicular trauma (around 85%) is the most common cause of testicle pain. Examples of causes of injuries to the testicle include, sports injuries, a direct kick to the groin or testicle, car accidents, and straddle injuries. Usually, the pain improves with time. Rarely, trauma to the testicles can cause more severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention.</p>.<p>The testicular pain may range from severe to absent at the time the person sees a doctor. Rarely however, the injury may seem minor, but there may be a serious underlying injury to the testicle.</p>.<p>Other symptoms and signs of trauma or injury to a testicle include:</p>.<p><b><a name="testicle_rupture_causes_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Testicle rupture is a serious injury to the that is a result of a disruption to the connective tissue enveloping the testicle (tunica albuginea), which then causes extrusion of testicular tissue. Often, a sign of testicular rupture is a blood collection (hematocele) that surrounds the testicle.</p>.<p>Other types of injuries that cause testicular rupture include penetrating trauma and testicular dislocation. These types of testicular injuries typically require surgery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="torsion_of_a_testicular_appendage_cause_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Torsion of a testicular appendage occurs due to twisting (torsion) of the testicular or epididymal appendage, which are functionless structures that are remnants of tissue from human development. The testicular appendage lies between the testicle and the epididymis, while the epididymal appendage typically projects from the epididymis. As with testicular torsion, twisting of these structures leads to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent testicular pain. This is a common condition in younger boys, with most cases occurring between 7 to 14 years of age. Though this condition is benign and self-limiting, it must be distinguished from the more serious testicular torsion.</p>.<p>With torsion of a testicular appendage, the onset of testicle pain may be sudden or gradual, and the severity of pain may range from mild to severe. Generally, a person has no symptoms or signs like nausea, vomiting, and fever.</p>.<p>The testicle and/or scrotum generally appear normal, without swelling and redness; however, other symptoms and signs may include:</p>.<p>Preservation of the normal vertical positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum, and preservation of the cremasteric reflex is generally maintained.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_kidney_stones_cause_testicular_pain_and_other_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Occasionally, the pain associated with kidney stones can radiate into the groin area and cause testicular pain.

Other signs and symptoms of kidney stones may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_causes_of_testicular_pain_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In order to diagnose the underlying condition causing testicular pain, a complete history and physical exam will be performed by a health-care professional. Laboratory testing and imaging studies may also be ordered depending on the health-care professional's initial impression and evaluation.</p>.<p>Laboratory testing may include:</p>.<p>Imaging studies may be ordered by your health-care professional to further delineate the underlying cause of the testicular pain. In certain patients with testicular pain whose symptoms are strongly suggestive of testicular torsion, immediate urologic consultation prior to testing should be obtained in order to prevent potential delays in definitive surgical management.</p>.<p>A color Doppler testicular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> is a non-invasive imaging study that can evaluate the blood flow to the testicles, as well as the presence of testicular tumors, fluid collections, testicular rupture, and hernias. A kidney ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of kidney stones.</p>.<p>This is an imaging study requiring the intravenous administration of a radionuclide, useful for the evaluation of testicular torsion, as well as other causes of testicular pain. It is used must less commonly than ultrasound.</p>.<p><b>CT scan or a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) X-ray </b></p>.<p>These particular imaging studies are sometimes ordered if there is a suspicion that the testicular pain is being caused by kidney stones or other conditions in the abdomen or pelvis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_testicular_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for testicular pain varies depending on the underlying cause. As already noted, some conditions causing testicular pain are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical intervention.</p>.<p>The treatment of uncomplicated epididymitis can generally be managed as an outpatient, and consists of the following treatment measures:</p>.<p>In general, acute epididymitis that is properly treated resolves without complications. However, in some cases of epididymitis, such as those associated with serious systemic symptoms or in those accompanied by various complications, hospitalization may be necessary. A urologist will be consulted in these more serious cases.</p>.<p>The treatment for torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendage is directed toward relief of symptoms, and consists of the following measures:</p>.<p>Most patients improve with these treatment measures within 1 week, though symptoms may last longer. In cases of testicular pain refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected tissue is considered.</p>.<p>The treatment for kidney stones generally depends on the location of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney stone</a>, the size of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stone_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">kidney stone</a>, and any associated complications, such as infection. An uncomplicated kidney stone can typically be treated with the following measures:</p>.<p>Several different measures exist for treating kidney stones that do not pass spontaneously, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lithotripsy_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lithotripsy</a> (the use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shock</a> waves to break up the kidney stone) and other more invasive surgical procedures.</p>.<p>Certain patients with intractable pain, intractable vomiting or those with signs of infection require hospitalization. In those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infection</a> and an obstruction in the genitourinary system, antibiotics and emergent urologic intervention is necessary.</p>.<p>The treatment and management of testicular trauma depends on the severity of injury. Minor cases of testicular trauma without suspected serious underlying testicular injury can be managed as an outpatient with the following measures:</p>.<p>With testicular rupture, immediate surgical repair is necessary to preserve testicular function and viability. Other situations requiring surgical management include certain blunt trauma injuries with associated blood collections (hematoceles), penetrating trauma, and certain cases of testicular dislocation.</p>.<p>The treatment of orchitis depends on the infectious organism responsible for causing the testicular inflammation. Both viral and bacterial orchitis can be treated with the following measures:</p>.<p>Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis require antibiotics. Those cases caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a> do not require antibiotics.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_causes_of_testicular_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The complications associated with the different causes of testicular pain are varied.
