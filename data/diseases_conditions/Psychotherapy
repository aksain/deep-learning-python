Psychotherapy is often the first form of treatment recommended for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>. Called "therapy" for short, the word psychotherapy actually involves a variety of treatment techniques. During psychotherapy, a person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> talks to a licensed and trained <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mental health</a> care professional who helps him or her identify and work through the factors that may be causing their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>.</p>.<p>
Sometimes these factors work in combination with heredity or chemical imbalances in the brain to trigger <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>. Taking care of the psychological and psychosocial aspects of depression is important.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_psychotherapy_help_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psychotherapy helps people with depression:</p>.<p><b><a name="types_of_therapy_for_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Therapy can be given in a variety of formats, including:</p>.<p><b><a name="approaches_to_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
While therapy can be done in different formats -- like family, group, and individual -- there are also several different approaches that mental health professionals can take to provide therapy. After talking with the patient about their depression, the therapist will decide which approach to use based on the suspected underlying factors contributing to the depression.</p>.<p><b><a name="psychodynamic_therapy_for_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Psychodynamic therapy is based on the assumption that a person is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depressed</a> because of unresolved, generally unconscious conflicts, often stemming from childhood. The goal of this type of therapy is for the patient to understand and cope better with these feelings by talking about the experiences. Psychodynamic therapy is administered over a period of weeks to months to years.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="interpersonal_therapy_for_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Interpersonal therapy focuses on the behaviors and interactions a depressed patient has with family, friends, co-workers, and other important people encountered on a day-to-day basis. The primary goal of this therapy is to improve communication skills and increase self-esteem during a short period of time. It usually lasts three to four months and works well for depression caused by loss and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_grief_and_bereavement/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">grief</a>, relationship conflicts, major life events, social isolation, or role transitions (such as becoming a mother or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caregiving/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caregiver</a>).
</p>.<p><b><a name="cognitive_behavioral_therapy_for_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) includes several different approaches to therapy, all of which focus on how thinking affects the way a person feels and acts. The idea of cognitive behavioral therapy is that you can change your way of thinking about a situation, and when you do, you also change the way you feel and act. As a result, you can feel better, and behave differently in response to life 
stresses, even when the situation stays the same.</p>.<p>
While other approaches to therapy rely heavily on analyzing and exploring people's relationship with the world around them, the focus of CBT is on learning. The therapist functions in many ways similar to a teacher. He or she guides the client through the process of learning how to change his or her way of thinking and then how to act on that learning. Because there is a specific goal and a process for arriving at it, CBT is often more narrowly focused. It also is typically completed in less time than other therapies.</p>.<p>
Two examples of different types of CBT are:</p>.<p><b><a name="therapy_tips" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Therapy works best when you attend all of your scheduled appointments and participate actively in the work of treatment. The effectiveness of therapy is not a passive process depends on your active participation. It requires time, effort, and consistency.</p>.<p>
As you begin therapy, establish some goals with your therapist. Then spend time periodically reviewing your progress with your therapist. If you don't like your therapist's approach or if you don't think the therapist is helping you, talk to him or her about it and/or seek a second opinion, but don't discontinue therapy abruptly.</p>.<p><b><a name="tips_to_help_you_get_started" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Remember, therapy involves evaluating your thoughts and behaviors, identifying stresses that contribute to depression, and working to modify both. People who actively participate in therapy recover more quickly and have fewer relapses. Therapy is treatment that addresses specific reactions to depression as an illness; it is not a "quick fix." It takes longer to begin to work than <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antidepressants</a>, but there is evidence to suggest that its effects may sometimes last longer, depending on the type of depression being treated. Antidepressants may be needed immediately in cases of severe depression, but the combination of therapy and medicine is very effective
