<p>A commonly injured area of the foot is the small bones of the toes (phalanges). There are 26 bones in the foot; 19 are bones in the forefoot (5 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/foot_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">metatarsals</a> and 14 phalanges). Trauma and the injury to the foot often causes one or more of the toe bones to break (fracture).</p>.<p>Trauma or injury such as stubbing the toe (jammed toe) or dropping a heavy object on the toe may cause a broken toe. The location of the toes (at the front part of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>) makes them the most likely part of the foot to be injured.</p>.<p>Prolonged repetitive movements, as in certain sports activities, can cause a type of broken type of broken toe called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress fracture</a> or hairline fracture. People with weakened bones (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoporosis</a> or other disorders) may develop stress fractures simply from wearing improper shoes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Many people think that if they can walk on an injured toe, it is not broken. This may not be the case. It is common to break a toe bone and still be able to walk on it.</p>.<p>Go to a hospital's emergency department if you have following signs or symptoms.</p>.<p>Call a doctor if any of the following occur:</p>.<p>Seek medical evaluation soon after the injury to ensure proper treatment and healing.</p>.<p>You initially may see a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or a child’s pediatrician when you first injure your toe. You likely willbe referred to an orthopedist or orthopedic surgeon, who specializes in disorders of the musculoskelteal system, or a podiatrist, a specialist in conditions of the foot, for treatment.</p>.<p>You also may be diagnosed with a broken toe in a hospital’s emergency department by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> specialist. Radiologists will read an X-ray or MRI, though they will usually report back to your primary care physician or emergency medicine specialist and you will not directly consult with them.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Most minor toe injuries can be treated at home. If a you are unsure or suspect a fracture, seek medical attention. The following may help decrease pain and swelling from a broken toe, and to help the fracture heal properly.</p>.<p>In certain situations, a broken toe may need medical care such as maneuvering the toe back into place (reduction), casting, or splinting the toe.</p>.<p>If there is a minor or small fracture in a bone of one of the small toes, a doctor may only need to tape the injured toe to the one next to it for support. This treatment is called buddy taping.</p>.<p>If the toe is buddy taped, it is usually safe to bathe, and then replace the tape afterward, however, check with the doctor prior to removing the tape to bathe. Always follow your doctor's instructions on how to tape your broken toe.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Depending on the location and severity of the toe fracture, the fracture may need to be put back into place (reduced) and splinted or casted. Because it has a significant weight bearing role, fractures of the big toe are often more serious and more likely to require reduction or surgical treatment. If there is an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid_pictures_slideshow_caring_for_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">open wound</a> near the injured toe, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tetanus</a> shot and antibiotic medication may also be necessary.</p>.<p>If there is an open (compound) fracture of the toe, surgery may be necessary in some cases, and antibiotics will be given. This type of fracture should be seen by a doctor immediately.</p>.<p>Usually only <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Motrin</a>) is needed for pain. For a severe fracture, the doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medication.</p>.<p>Talk to the doctor to have the broken toe evaluated to be certain it is healing properly. Call a doctor or go to an emergency department if any problems or complications develop before the scheduled appointment.</p>.<p>The healing time for broken toes usually is take about six weeks to heal. If problems last longer than six weeks, another X-ray may be needed, or the injury should be rechecked by the doctor to evaluate how the bone is healing. Simple toe fractures usually heal well with no problems. However, a severe fracture or a fracture that goes into a joint is at risk for developing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and possibly even a deformity.</p>.<p>Other problems may develop as a result of the broken toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). Inadequate treatment of a broken toe may lead to complications including foot deformities and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic pain</a>. Even when a broken toe is treated promptly, complications may arise including:</p>
