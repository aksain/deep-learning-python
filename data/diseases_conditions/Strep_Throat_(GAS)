<p>Strep throat is a bacterial infection of the soft palate and tonsillar region. Microbiologists identify the member of the <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Streptococcus</a></i> bacterial family that causes strep throat as "GAS" (Group A, beta hemolytic, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>).</p>.<p>Strep throat is most common in young children and adolescents, but it can also occur in toddlers and adults. Strep throat is highly contagious and it is present most commonly in the community during the winter months. Symptoms and physical signs of strep throat may vary depending upon the age of the person infected.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Strep throat is highly contagious and is most commonly spread via direct person-to-person contact.</p>.<p>Strep throat will usually get better on its own within two to five days, however, you may start feeling better within a day or two after antibiotics are started. Strep throat remains contagious for the first 24 hours after starting antibiotics, so it is recommended that people stay home from work or school to avoid spreading the infection.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Signs of strep throat are not unique - many viral infections (which cause the majority of sore throats) can have identical signs and symptoms as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">group A strep</a> (GAS) infection. Typically, an older child and adolescent will experience symptoms such as:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/runny_nose/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Runny nose</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>, hoarse voice, muscle aches, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a> and oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blisters</a> are generally not seen with a strep throat infection. These symptoms usually indicate a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sore throat</a> caused by a virus.</p>.<p>Adults with strep throat may have milder symptoms that may not prompt a medical evaluation unless an exposure history to strep throat is known.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Other signs and symptoms of strep throat infection may include:</p>.<p>While most patients with strep throat will experience these signs and symptoms, not all will necessarily be present in each individual.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The information above is seen in those most likely to have a strep throat infection, including older children and teenagers. However, other age groups may experience some different symptoms with a strep throat infection.</p>.<p>There are two common tests used to diagnose strep throat the rapid strep test (RADT) and traditional throat culture.</p>.<p>The traditional test, a throat culture, involves obtaining a swab from the back of the throat and tonsils. It takes approximately 24 to 48 hours to determine the presence or absence of the group A strep bacteria. This test is typically more accurate in diagnosing strep throat than the rapid strep test.</p>.<p>The rapid strep and throat culture tests are designed to determine whether an individual currently has a strep throat infection. Sometimes it may be necessary to determine whether a patient has had a recent history of a strep infection. In that case, two blood tests are available:</p>.<p>The antibodies that these tests are sensitive to are not commonly present until a few weeks following an acute strep infection. These tests may be ordered when evaluating a patient who may have developed delayed complications (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatic_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatic fever</a> or glomerulonephritis) after a strep throat infection.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Treatment of a strep throat infection includes the use of antibiotics and over-the-counter medications and home remedies for the reduction of symptoms.</p>.<p>There are a number of home remedies that may be used to reduce the symptoms of strep throat. They may be used whether the patient has strep throat or a viral cause of their illness. These remedies should not be used in lieu of a complete course of antibiotics if a strep infection is being treated. Home remedies to soothe symptoms of strep throat include:</p>.<p>Several over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a>) such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Motrin</a>) can be used to lower the fever and provide pain relief for the sore throat. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aspirin</a> should not be used in children or adolescents because of its association with Reye syndrome.</p>.<p>Antibiotics provide the mainstay for successfully treating a strep throat infection.</p>.<p>If a woman contracts strep throat during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>, the same types of antibiotics are typically used for treatment. All penicillin-type and cephalosporin-type antibiotics are considered safe for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> women. Because fever is a common symptom of strep throat, pregnant women are advised to take fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Aspirin and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAID</a>’s should be avoided during pregnancy. Consult your doctor if you are pregnant and you think you have strep throat, and follow your doctor’s instructions for medication use.</p>.<p>Strep throat is typically diagnosed and treated by a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child’s pediatrician. If you go to a hospital’s emergency department, you will be seen by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> specialist.</p>.<p>If you have recurring or chronic strep throat, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, sometimes referred to as an ENT (ear, nose, and throat specialist) for treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The possible complications of strep throat include:</p>.<p>There is no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> currently available to prevent strep throat, but there are several behaviors to lessen the likelihood of developing a strep throat infection. These include:</p>
