<p><b><a name="heart_failure_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The term heart failure can be frightening, but in reality, it just means that 
the heart is not pumping as well as it could be. When the heart muscle is weak, 
blood cannot be pumped efficiently enough to get oxygen to all of the cells. 
Sometimes the heart becomes dilated and weak. Other times it may be stiff and 
thickened. Over time, the heart cannot keep up with its workload. When this 
happens, there isn't enough oxygenated blood reaching the brain and muscles, and 
fluid begins to backup in the
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> and other tissues. The lack of oxygen 
causes the main symptoms of heart failure such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, shortness of breath, 
and difficulty completing tasks that require exertion. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The heart has four chambers through which blood pumps. Newly oxygenated blood is pumped from the lungs to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">left atrium</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">left ventricle</a> and out through the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/aorta_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">aorta</a> to circulate through the rest of the body. After the oxygen has been used, the blood returns through the veins to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">right atrium</a> and right ventricle into the lungs to be re-oxygenated.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_heart_failure_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of heart failure include:</p>.<p>Symptoms are usually worse at night when lying flat. Symptoms are very 
similar for systolic and diastolic heart failure. Your doctor may need further 
testing to see which type you have.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common risk factors for heart failure include:</p>.<p>Less well recognized risk factors of heart failure include:</p>.<p>All of these also contribute to coronary artery 
disease, which is a major risk factor for heart failure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of heart failure is a weakened or thickened cardiac muscle. For 
example, in chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a> (hypertension), the heart must pump 
extra forcefully against the additional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a>. First it becomes 
enlarged and thickened. But over time, the heart weakens, scarring (fibrosis) 
develops, and it becomes less efficient at pumping. It can become larger 
(dilated) and weak or thickened and stiff. When the risk factors for heart 
failure are present, there usually is inflammatory stress, which further damages 
the cardiac muscle depleting cells of energy and antioxidants. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_heart_failure_stages_or_classifications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While doctors define heart failure in stages or classifications, it 
represents a progression of heart muscle weakness. Sometimes people refer to 
this process as chronic heart failure but technically that term isn't correct.
</p>.<p>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) puts the stages of heart failure into 
four classifications:</p>.<p>The American Heart Association along with the American College of Cardiology 
grades heart failure in four stages, and takes into account that heart failure 
can be present even before symptoms appear:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_heart_failure_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heart failure treatment options include making healthier decisions about 
lifestyle and diet, taking medications, and sometimes implanting devices. Heart 
transplant is sometimes considered for certain individuals.</p>.<p>In acute or decompensated heart failure, the person may need hospitalization or even 
intravenous medications to help recover.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_diet_and_lifestyle_management_techniques_help_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many lifestyle and diet factors can improve, or even reverse, congestive heart failure. Cardiac rehabilitation programs can teach people how to make lifestyle changes, as can integrative cardiology clinics. Some of the lifestyle factors that make a difference include:</p>.<p>Talk to your doctor before taking any herbs or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_treat_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Medications help reduce the symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and 
can actually improve heart muscle function. There are several main classes of 
medications that are used for treating a weak heart muscle. Your physician will 
choose medications based on your symptoms and whether your heart needs to be 
strengthened or relaxed. The types of medications commonly prescribed for heart 
failure include: </p>.<p><b><a name="what_procedures_or_surgery_treats_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In severe heart failure, devices can help the heart pump better. Left 
Ventricular Assist Devices (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/left_ventricular_assist_device_lvad/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">LVAD</a>) are implanted mechanical pumps that are most 
commonly used when people are waiting for heart transplants. </p>.<p>When medications and lifestyle haven't stopped the progression of heart 
failure, surgical transplantation of a donor heart can be lifesaving. </p>.<p>Other 
surgical procedures can sometimes be performed earlier to address the risk factors 
and causes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_artery_bypass_graft/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery bypass</a>, percutaneous 
coronary intervention, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angioplasty</a> 
to open the blockages of coronary atherosclerosis. </p>.<p><b><a name="which_specialties_of_doctors_treat_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may initially see your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family 
practitioner or internist, and in a sudden or severe situation you may be seen 
by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">emergency medicine</a> specialist in a hospital's emergency department. </p>.<p>You will be referred to a cardiologist, a specialist in disorders of the 
heart. You also may see some sub-specialties of cardiology, including a cardiac electrophysiologist, who specializes in electrical and heart rhythm problems, or 
a cardiothoracic surgeon if surgery is needed. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_potential_complications_of_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The complications of heart failure include severe fatigue and weakness, 
inability to complete activities of daily living, kidney damage, and progressive 
heart failure that could ultimately require heart transplant. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_and_life_expectancy_for_a_person_with_heart_failure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The course of heart failure is highly variable. People who address their risk 
factors and make lifestyle changes may never progress. However, if changes are 
not made, if medications are not taken, or if the underlying causes are not 
correctable, heart failure can become a progressive and eventually fatal 
condition. This means that the heart muscle will continue to get weaker and have 
more difficulty keeping up with the workload. Fortunately, many 
treatment options exist for heart failure.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_heart_failure_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
