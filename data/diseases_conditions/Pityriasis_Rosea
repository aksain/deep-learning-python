<p><b><a name="pityriasis_rosea_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pityriasis rosea is a common viral disease that usually affects individuals between 10-35 years of age. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> typically lasts six to nine weeks, rarely extending longer than 12 weeks. Once a person has pityriasis rosea, it generally does not recur in their lifetime.</p>.<p>Pityriasis rosea characteristically begins as an asymptomatic single, large pink, scaly plaque called the "herald patch" or mother patch, measuring 2-10 centimeters. The herald patch is a slightly scaly dry pink to red plaque which appears on the back, chest, or neck and has a well-defined, scaly border.</p>.<p>One to two weeks following the initial appearance of the herald patch, those affected will then develop many smaller pink spots across their trunk, arms, and legs. The second stage of pityriasis rosea erupts with a large number of oval spots, ranging in diameter from 0.5 centimeter (size of a pencil eraser) to 1.5 centimeters (size of a peanut). The individual spots form a symmetrical "Christmas tree" pattern on the back with the long axis of the ovals oriented in the "Lines of Blaschko" (invisible skin lines of embryonic origin). This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a> is usually limited to the trunk, arms, and legs. Pityriasis rosea usually spares the face, hands, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pityriasis rosea is, for the most part, equally common in men and women. It generally occurs in children and young adults between 10-35 years of age. Pityriasis rosea has no racial predominance. Most people only develop pityriasis rosea once in their lifetime.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_pityriasis_rosea_is_pityriasis_rosea_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact cause of pityriasis rosea remains unknown. Most recently, pityriasis rosea has been associated most strongly with a virus from the human <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">herpes</a> family called human herpes virus types 6 and/or 7. Pityriasis rosea is not caused by or known to be associated with the common types of herpes virus that causes genital, oral herpes, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">varicella</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chickenpox</a>). While the mode of transmission (how it gets passed between people) of pityriasis rosea is also unknown, respiratory contact has been postulated. Pityriasis rosea does not seem to be directly or immediately contagious to close contacts or health-care providers exposed to the rash. Most people with a known exposure to pityriasis rosea do not seem to contract the rash.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_pityriasis_rosea_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people do not notice any symptoms with pityriasis rosea except for the appearance of the rash itself. Mild, intermittent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a> is reported in about 50% of individuals affected, especially when people <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> or take hot showers. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Itching</a> seems to increase with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>. Rarely, it is accompanied by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">flu-like</a> symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sore throat</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, aching, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/decreased_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">decreased appetite</a>. Most people are otherwise in very good health and don't exhibit any other symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_make_a_diagnosis_of_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Usually, a doctor may make a diagnosis of pityriasis rosea solely on the basis of its appearance, particularly the onset of the distinct large herald patch and the symmetrical Christmas tree presentation. Also, the herald patch tends to have a fine scale with a definite border, the so-called "collarette." To rule out other types of skin disorders, a physician may scrape the skin and examine the scales under the microscope to detect fungus infection that could mimic pityriasis rosea. Also, blood tests including rapid plasma reagent (RPR) may be done to detect secondary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/syphilis_in_women_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">syphilis</a>, which also may mimic pityriasis rosea. In some cases, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">skin biopsy</a> may be required to rule out other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_conditions_picture_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">skin conditions</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_common_misdiagnoses_of_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first herald patch of pityriasis rosea may look very similar in appearance to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ringworm</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tinea corporis</a>). Pityriasis rosea has also been mistaken with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a>, which can occur as similar scaly patches, but not in the same distribution as pityriasis rosea.</p>.<p>Pityriasis rosea may be misdiagnosed as</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_pityriasis_rosea_how_long_does_pityriasis_rosea_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pityriasis rosea usually requires no treatment and resolves spontaneously. Treatment is not necessary if the rash does not cause significant symptoms. Typically, pityriasis rosea will usually clear on its own within six to nine weeks without medical intervention.</p>.<p>The most common symptom is itching, which can be treated with topical steroid creams (like hydrocortisone cream) and oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a> (like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">diphenhydramine</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Benadryl</a>], <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cetirizine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">cetirizine</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cetirizine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zyrtec</a>]). These will not shorten the duration of the rash but will decrease the itching. Another treatment for itching is ultraviolet light (UVB) or sunlight. Generally, the best treatment is to avoid being overheated by reducing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> and avoiding hot showers and baths.</p>.<p>There has been limited evidence of reduced duration of pityriasis rosea with the off-label use of the antibiotic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erythromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">erythromycin</a> or off-label use of antiviral medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acyclovir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zovirax</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famciclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">famciclovir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famciclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Famvir</a>). However, neither of these medications has been proven to be uniformly effective in the treatment of pityriasis rosea and they are not usually necessary or required.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_home_remedies_can_i_use_for_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Home remedies of pityriasis rosea include taking lukewarm baths or showers, avoiding drying soaps, wearing cotton or silk clothing to reduce heat, and taking oatmeal baths. Calamine or menthol lotions can also be helpful for itching. The following are additional home remedies:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_pityriasis_rosea_dangerous_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If pityriasis rosea occurs early in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>, within the first 15 weeks, there seems to be a greater chance of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">miscarriage</a>. In addition, children of affected mothers may be prone to premature delivery. Since there little that can be done to prevent this disease or treat it, affected mothers are monitored closely for potential problems. Occasionally, health care professionals consider treatment with acyclovir.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_%0Apossible_to_prevent_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no definitive prevention for pityriasis rosea, as the cause is not yet fully known.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_pityriasis_rosea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for pityriasis rosea is excellent as the rash usually clears even without treatment within nine weeks.</p>.<p>It typically leaves no long-lasting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scars</a>, although some mild, temporary skin discoloration called post inflammatory hypopigmentation or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/phytophotodermatitis_hyperpigmentation_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">hyperpigmentation</a> can occur in people with darker skin.
