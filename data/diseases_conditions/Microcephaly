Microcephaly can be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_microcephaly" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is most often caused by genetic abnormalities that interfere with the growth of the cerebral cortex during the early months of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fetal_development_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">fetal development</a>. It is associated with Down's syndrome, chromosomal syndromes, and neurometabolic syndromes. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Babies</a> may also be born with microcephaly if, during pregnancy, their mother abused drugs or alcohol, became infected with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cytomegalovirus_cmv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cytomegalovirus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rubella</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">German measles</a>), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">varicella</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chicken pox</a>) virus, was exposed to certain toxic chemicals, or had untreated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phenylketonuria/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">phenylketonuria</a> (PKU).</p>.<p>Babies born with microcephaly will have a smaller than normal head that will fail to grow as they progress through infancy.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_microcephaly_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending on the severity of the accompanying syndrome, children with microcephaly may have</p>.<p>Some children with microcephaly will have normal intelligence and a head that will grow bigger, but they will track below the normal growth curves for head circumference.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_treatment_for_microcephaly" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no treatment for microcephaly that can return a child's head to a normal size or shape. Treatment focuses on ways to decrease the impact of the associated deformities and neurological disabilities. Children with microcephaly and developmental delays are usually evaluated by a pediatric neurologist and followed by a medical management team. Early childhood intervention programs that involve physical, speech, and occupational therapists help to maximize abilities and minimize dysfunction. Medications are often used to control seizures, hyperactivity, and neuromuscular symptoms. Genetic counseling may help families understand the risk for microcephaly in subsequent pregnancies.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_microcephaly" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some children will only have mild disability. Others, especially if they are otherwise growing and developing normally, will have normal intelligence and continue to develop and meet regular age-appropriate milestones.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_research_is_being_done_on_microcephaly" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research relating to microcephaly in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. A small group of researchers studying a rare neurometabolic syndrome (3-PGDH), which causes microcephaly, have successfully used amino acid replacement therapy to reduce and prevent seizures.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="for_more_information" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The Arc of the United States<br>1825 K Street, NW<br>Suite 1200<br>Washington, DC 20006<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6c25020a032c1804090d1e0f42031e0b">[email protected]</a><br><a href="http://www.thearc.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.thearc.org</a><br>Tel: 202-534-3700 800-433-5255<br>Fax: 202-534-3731</p>.<p>Birth Defect Research for Children, Inc.<br>976 Lake Baldwin Lane<br>Suite 104<br>Orlando, FL 32814<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d3f382929241d3f342f293539383b383e292e73322f3a">[email protected]</a><br><a href="http://www.birthdefects.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.birthdefects.org</a><br>Tel: 407-895-0802</p>.<p>March of Dimes Foundation<br>1275 Mamaroneck Avenue<br>White Plains, NY 10605<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4425372f313704292536272c2b22202d2921376a272b29">[email protected]</a><br><a href="http://www.marchofdimes.com" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.marchofdimes.com</a><br>Tel: 914-997-4488 888-MODIMES (663-4637)<br>Fax: 914-428-8203</p>.<p>National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities<br>U.S. Dept. of Education, Office of Special Education Programs<br>1825 Connecticut Avenue NW, Suite 700<br>Washington, DC 20009<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c8a6a1aba0abb188a9adace6a7baaf">[email protected]</a><br><a href="http://www.nichcy.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.nichcy.org</a><br>Tel: 800-695-0285 202-884-8200<br>Fax: 202-884-8441<span id="cntid"></span></p>
