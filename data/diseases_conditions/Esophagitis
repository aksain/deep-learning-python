There are several types of esophagitis depending on the cause. Esophagitis can be caused by infection, irritation of the esophagus, or inflammation of the lining of the esophagus. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_esophagitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of esophagitis include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_esophagitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several types of esophagitis. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_esophagitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Esophagitis can be caused by infection or irritation of the esophagus. </p>.<p>Infections of the esophagus can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, including: </p>.<p>One of the main causes of esophageal irritation is reflux of stomach acid.

Medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a> and other anti-inflammatory drugs can irritate the lining of the esophagus, and also cause increased acid production in the stomach that can lead to acid reflux. </p>.<p>Drug-induced esophagitis occurs when large pills are taken with too little water or just before bedtime 
and they dissolve or get stuck in the esophagus, causing irritation. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Radiation</a> to the chest (thorax), for cancer treatment can cause burns leading to scarring and inflammation of the esophagus.</p>.<p>Other causes of esophageal irritation:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_grades_of_esophagitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are number of grading systems used to evaluate the severity of the

Do not take these medications long-term.

This scarring can narrow the esophagus, eventually interfering with the ability to swallow.</p>.<p>A major complication, which occurs in a significant portion of people with chronic or longstanding GERD, is Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal cancer. A 
very few of those who develop Barrett's esophagus will develop esophageal adenocarcinoma. </p>.<p>Severe esophagitis may lead to difficult or painful swallowing, and malnutrition. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_esophagitis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some types of esophagitis can be prevented. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_person_with_esophagitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
