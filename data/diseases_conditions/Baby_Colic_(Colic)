Infantile colic has been around for a long time.  In 1954, Dr. Morris Wessel, a well-known New Haven 
pediatrician, defined an infant with colic as "one who, otherwise healthy and well-fed, had paroxysms of irritability, fussing, or crying lasting for a total of three hours a day and occurring on more than three days in any one week for a period of three weeks." It is also important to remember that not all fussy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a> suffer from colic.  Most 
infants normally cry 
two to three hours per day, but this is usually spread out during the 24-hour period.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_colic_symptoms_and_signs_in_babies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The crying or fussing most frequently begins suddenly and often after a feeding. The cry is loud and continuous, and the spells last from one to four hours.  The baby's face often gets flushed or red. The belly is sometimes distended or prominent, the legs alternating between flexed and extended straight out; the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> are often <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> and the hands clenched. The episodes, while they can occur at any time of the day or night, typically begin in the late afternoon or early evening, just when 
parents or caregivers are most exhausted.  There are some babies who are more prone to infantile colic than others. It is generally believed that if one or both parents were colicky, their baby is more at risk. Infantile 
colic typically begins at about 2 to 3 weeks of age, reaches its peak at 2 months, begins to subside by 3 months, and is gone by 3Â½ to 4 months of age. But the frustrating fact remains that although one in four babies has colic and much research has been done on the topic, there is no one proven cause of colic. In some studies, no discernible cause was found for 
one-quarter of those babies who suffered from colicky episodes.  This reality is very frustrating for most parents.</p>.<p>
It is certainly known that amongst all colicky babies, there are factors that may worsen the colic symptoms:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_to_help_with_colic_in__babies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
This is a very common problem (up to 25% 
of all babies suffer from colic). Discuss any concerns with the child's pediatrician 
and talk to other parents or relatives who have had similar experiences. Also 
keep in mind that colic generally occurs in big, healthy, active, vigorous 
babies who are great eaters and who grow very well. Sickly, poor-feeding, 
unhealthy babies or babies with significant underlying problems may well be 
cranky, miserable, and unhappy; however, these infants tend to be this way most 
of the time, whereas the baby with colic generally has episodes at a very 
predictable ("set your clock by the beginning and end") time of the day.</p>.<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_the_doctor_do_to_help_a_colicky_baby_what_is_the_treatment_for_colic__in_an_infant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
It is critically important to consult the baby's doctor at the very beginning of the suspected colic symptoms. While there are no tests that can be done where the results come back "colic," it is very important to exclude several other causes of crying or sudden-onset screaming in a newborn.  Remember that other less serious causes of crying include anything that causes discomfort.  Check if 
the infant is hungry, too cold or too warm, over-tired or suffering from food intolerance (gassy, overly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loose stool</a>).  Other more serious conditions to consider include intestinal blockage or obstruction, abdominal infection, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hernia_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hernia</a>, a scratch of the baby's eye, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ear infection</a>, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bladder infection</a>, and others. Once the baby is given a clean bill of health, an understanding, supportive doctor is worth his weight in gold! 
Should a colicky baby's symptoms ever suddenly change, the doctor will reassess the situation and look for unrelated problems that can arise in any baby. As discussed above, the doctor may recommend an over-the-counter anti-gas bubble medicine for the baby (for example, Mylicon Drops) or even a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/probiotics/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">probiotic</a>. 
Babies take these medications orally. And when it seems that there are as many "cures" for colic as there are grandparents, always call 
the baby's doctor first. Finally, remember that after the three or four months, the colic resolves; there are no long-term problems associated with colic.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
