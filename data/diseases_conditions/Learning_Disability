A learning disability can cause a person to have trouble learning and using certain skills. The skills most often affected are: </p>.<p>Learning disabilities (LD) vary from person to person. One person with learning disabilities may not have the same kind of learning problems as another person with learning disabilities. One person may have trouble with reading and writing. Another person with learning disabilities may have problems with understanding math. Still another person may have trouble in each of these areas, as well as with understanding what people are saying.</p>.<p>Researchers think that learning disabilities are caused by differences in how a person's brain works and how it processes information. Children with learning disabilities are not "dumb" or "lazy." In fact, they usually have average or above average intelligence. Their brains just process information differently.</p>.<p>The definition of "learning disability" just below comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The IDEA is the federal law that guides how schools provide special education and related services to children with disabilities. </p>.<p>There is no "cure" for learning disabilities. They are life-long. However, children with learning disabilities can be high achievers and can be taught ways to get around the learning disability. With the right help, children with learning disabilities can and do learn successfully. </p>.<p>IDEA's Definition of "Learning Disability" </p>.<p><i>Our nation's special education law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, defines a specific learning disability as . . . </i></p>.<p>". . . a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain injury</a>, minimal brain dysfunction, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyslexia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dyslexia</a>, and developmental <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aphasia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aphasia</a>." </p>.<p>However, learning disabilities do not include, "...learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a>, or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage." <i>34 Code of Federal Regulations §300.7(c)(10)</i><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_are_learning_disabilities" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Very common! As many as 1 out of every 5 people in the United States has a learning disability. Almost 3 million children (ages 6 through 21) have some form of a learning disability and receive special education in school. In fact, over half of all children who receive special education have a learning disability (T<i>wenty-fourth Annual Report to Congress</i>, U.S. Department of Education, 2002).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_of_a_learning_disability" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no one sign that shows a person has a learning disability. Experts look for a noticeable difference between how well a child does in school and how well he or she could do, given his or her intelligence or ability. There are also certain clues that may mean a child has a learning disability. We've listed a few below. Most relate to elementary school tasks, because learning disabilities tend to be identified in elementary school. A child probably won't show all of these signs, or even most of them. However, if a child shows a number of these problems, then parents and the teacher should consider the possibility that the child has a learning disability. </p>.<p>When a child has a learning disability, he or she: </p>.<p>If a child has unexpected problems learning to read, write, listen, speak, or do math, then teachers and parents may want to investigate more. The same is true if the child is struggling to do any one of these skills. The child may need to be evaluated to see if he or she has a learning disability. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_school_and_learning_disabilities" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Learning disabilities tend to be diagnosed when children reach school age. This is because school focuses on the very things that may be difficult for the child - reading, writing, math, listening, speaking, 
and reasoning. Teachers and parents notice that the child is not learning as expected. The school may ask to evaluate the child to see what is causing the problem. Parents can also ask for their child to be evaluated. </p>.<p>With hard work and the proper help, children with learning disabilities can learn more easily and successfully. For school-aged children (including preschoolers), special education and related services are important sources of help. School staff work with the child's parents to develop an <a onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" href="http://idea.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Individualized Education Program</a>, or IEP. This document describes the child's unique needs. It also describes the special education services that will be provided to meet those needs. These services are provided at no cost to the child or family. </p>.<p>Supports or changes in the classroom (sometimes called accommodations) help most students with learning disabilities. Some common accommodations are listed below in "Tips for Teachers". Assistive technology can also help many students work around their learning disabilities. Assistive technology can range from "low-tech" equipment such as tape recorders to "high-tech" tools such as reading machines (which read books aloud) and voice recognition systems (which allow the student to "write" by talking to the computer). </p>.<p>It's important to remember that a childs learning disabilities may need help at home as well as in school.

The more you know, the more you can help yourself and your child. See the list of resources and organizations at the end of this article. </p>.<p><b><a name="tips_for_teachers_of_children_with_learning_disabilities" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Learn as much as you can about the different types of learning disabilities. The resources and organizations at the end of this document can help you identify specific techniques and strategies to support the student educationally. </p>.<p>Seize the opportunity to make an enormous difference in this student's life! Find out and emphasize what the student's strengths and interests are. Give the student positive feedback and lots of opportunities for practice. </p>.<p>Review the student's evaluation records to identify where specifically the student has trouble. Talk to specialists in your school (e.g., special education teacher) about methods for teaching this student. Provide instruction and accommodations to address the student's special needs. Examples include: </p>.<p>Learn about the different testing modifications that can really help a student with learning disabilities show what he or she has learned. </p>.<p>Teach organizational skills, study skills, and learning strategies. These help all students but are particularly helpful to those with learning disabilities. </p>.<p>Work with the student's parents to create an educational plan tailored to meet the student's needs. </p>.<p>Establish a positive working relationship with the student's parents. Through regular communication, exchange information about the student's progress at school. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_treatment_for_learning_disabilities" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. Specially trained educators may perform a diagnostic educational evaluation assessing the child's academic and intellectual potential and level of academic performance. Once the evaluation is complete, the basic approach is to teach learning skills by building on the child's abilities and strengths while correcting and compensating for disabilities and weaknesses. Other professionals such as speech and language therapists also may be involved. Some medications may be effective in helping the child learn by enhancing attention and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concentration</a>. Psychological therapies may also be used. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_learning_disabilities" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions. In some people, several overlapping learning disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single, isolated learning problem that has little impact on their lives. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_research_is_being_done_for_learning_disabilities" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health including the National Institute of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Child Health</a> and Human Development, the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the National Institute of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Mental Health</a> support research on learning disabilities.
