It's frequently described as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> that occurs around, behind, or above the eye and along the temple in cyclic patterns or clusters. The pain of a cluster <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a> is very severe. Many patients describe a “drilling” type of sensation.</p>.<p>For a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headache</a> to be classified as a rue cluster <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">headache</a>, the person will have symptoms like tearing/watering of the eye, redness of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctiva</a>, rhinorrhea or nasal stuffiness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> drooping, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a> on one side of the face, or changes in pupil size (with the pupil on the affected side becoming notably smaller). The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">headache</a> lasts from 15 minutes to a maximum duration of about 3 hours. However, the headache can recur up to eight times daily. Cluster headache was originally described in the 17th century, but it wasn't until the mid- 20th century that it became known by this name.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_cluster_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Males are two to four times more likely to develop cluster headache than females; however, the overall frequency is quite low, with a prevalence rate of about 1 per 1,000. Because of the rarity of the condition, limited information is available.</p>.<p>Although the vast majority of patients are adults, cluster headache has been reported in children as young as 6 years of age.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_cluster_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cluster headache is always unilateral, or one-sided. However, some people may experience some variability of the side on which their headache occurs.</p>.<p>Most people with cluster <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a> describe their pain as occurring around or behind the eye. Pain may radiate along the forehead, into the jaw or along the gum line and into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">teeth</a>, or across the cheek of the affected side. Infrequently, pain may extend into the ear, neck, or shoulder.</p>.<p>In addition to head pain, many people with cluster <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headaches</a> have symptoms and signs that may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_cluster_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The specific cause and anatomic origination of cluster headaches isn't known. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> studies suggest dilation of the ophthalmic artery during an acute cluster headache, while PET scans reveal activity within the cavernous sinus. However, many patients with other headache types also have revealed abnormalities in similar regions, so these tests aren't definitive. There is some evidence that the hypothalamus may be involved in the recurrence cycle of cluster headaches. Activation of the trigeminal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ganglion/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ganglion</a> can cause many changes associated with cluster headache, but the trigger for activation of this region hasn't been identified.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_triggers_cluster_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many patients report their headaches begin while sleeping. Additionally, alcohol can trigger cluster headaches in patients who are in the midst of a cycle. Histamines and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitroglycerin</a> can trigger cluster headaches in patients. Seasonal variation has been described, although this is inconsistent for many patients. Some patients have clusters precipitated by environmental changes or changes in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> or activity levels. Hormonal factors, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstruation</a>, do not seem to trigger cluster headache. Other risk factors include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a> and a family history of the problem.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_cluster_headaches_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of cluster headache is typically made after the history of headaches has been explored and a physical examination is completed. Cluster headaches are unique in their presentation, and often the history is sufficient to make the diagnosis. While no imaging study or specific blood test can confirm the diagnosis of cluster headache, an MRI or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> of the brain may be ordered to confirm that there are no other contributing factors that may mimic cluster headache symptoms. In some cases, ophthalmologic evaluation is needed to exclude problems within the eye itself that may be causing symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_natural_or_medication_treatments_for_cluster_headache_pain_and_associated_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of cluster headache can be divided into two distinct categories -- relief of the acute headache and prevention of future headaches.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_cluster_headaches_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Once cluster headaches have been accurately diagnosed, long-term treatment can be beneficial to decrease or prevent future cycles. However, as the specific underlying cause isn't known, it may take some time to control the headache cycles.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_cluster_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Over time, cluster headache seems to diminish in frequency, but this may take many years. Cluster headache can go into remission for an extended period of time and then recur. As such, discussion with your physician regarding need for continuation of treatment is warranted.</p>.<p>Cluster headache does not appear to be associated with other neurological illness, such as Alzheimer's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dementia</a>, Parkinson's disease, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple sclerosis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">MS</a>); however, many individuals with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">multiple sclerosis</a> are known to experience severe headaches.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
