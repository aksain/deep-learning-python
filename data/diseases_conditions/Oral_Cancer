Davis, MD, PhD</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_oral_cavity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This article is about cancers that occur in the mouth (oral cavity) and the part of the throat at the back of the mouth (oropharynx). The oral cavity and oropharynx have many parts:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the organs of the body.</p>.<p>Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place.</p>.<p>Sometimes this orderly process goes wrong. New cells form when the body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass of tissue called a growth or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a>. The kinds of cells found in the tumor determine how the tumor will behave.</p>.<p>Tumors can be benign or malignant:</p>.<p>Oral cancer is part of a group of cancers called head and neck cancers. Oral cancer can develop in any part of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Most oral cancers begin in the tongue and in the floor of the mouth. Almost all oral cancers begin in the flat cells (squamous cells) that cover the surfaces of the mouth, tongue, and lips. These cancers are called squamous cell carcinomas.</p>.<p>When oral cancer spreads (metastasizes), it usually travels through the lymphatic system. Cancer cells that enter the lymphatic system are carried along by lymph, a clear, watery fluid. The cancer cells often appear first in nearby <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a> in the neck.</p>.<p>Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the neck, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>, and other parts of the body. When this happens, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells as the primary tumor. For example, if oral cancer spreads to the lungs, the cancer cells in the lungs are actually oral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic oral cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lung cancer</a>. It is treated as oral cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lung cancer</a>. Doctors sometimes call the new tumor "distant" or metastatic disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="whos_at_risk_for_oral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors cannot always explain why one person develops oral cancer and another does not. However, we do know that this disease is not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contagious</a>. You cannot "catch" oral cancer from another person.</p>.<p>Research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop oral cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of developing a disease.</p>.<p>The following are risk factors for oral cancer:</p>.<p>Quitting tobacco reduces the risk of oral cancer. Also, quitting reduces the chance that a person with oral cancer will get a second cancer in the head and neck region. People who stop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> can also reduce their risk of cancer of the lung, larynx, mouth, pancreas, bladder, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a>.There are many resources to help smokers quit:</p>.<p>Some studies suggest that not eating enough fruits and vegetables may increase the chance of getting oral cancer. Human papilloma virus is a common viral infection. Today, it is emerging as another important risk factor. Research now suggests as many as half of oropharynx cancers are caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genital_warts_in_women/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a> infection.</p>.<p>If you think you may be at risk, you should discuss this concern with your doctor or dentist. You may want to ask about an appropriate schedule for checkups. Your health care team will probably tell you that not using tobacco and limiting your use of alcohol are the most important things you can do to prevent oral cancers. Also, if you spend a lot of time in the sun, using a lip balm that contains sunscreen and wearing a hat with a brim will help protect your lips.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_oral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your regular checkup is a good time for your dentist or doctor to check your entire mouth for signs of cancer. Regular checkups can detect the early stages of oral cancer or conditions that may lead to oral cancer. Ask your doctor or dentist about checking the tissues in your mouth as part of your routine exam.</p>.<p>Common symptoms of oral cancer include:</p>.<p>Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor or dentist so that any problem can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Most often, these symptoms do not mean cancer. An infection or another problem can cause the same symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_oral_cancer_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have symptoms that suggest oral cancer, the doctor or dentist checks your mouth and throat for red or white patches, lumps, swelling, or other problems. This exam includes looking carefully at the roof of the mouth, back of the throat, and insides of the cheeks and lips. The doctor or dentist also gently pulls out your tongue so it can be checked on the sides and underneath. The floor of your mouth and lymph nodes in your neck also are checked.</p>.<p>If an exam shows an abnormal area, a small sample of tissue may be removed. Removing tissue to look for cancer cells is called a biopsy. Usually, a biopsy is done with local anesthesia. Sometimes, it is done under general anesthesia. A pathologist then looks at the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only sure way to know if the abnormal area is cancerous.</p>.<p>If you need a biopsy, you may want to ask the doctor or dentist some of the following questions:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_oral_cancer_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If the biopsy shows that cancer is present, your doctor needs to know the stage (extent) of your disease to plan the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to what parts of the body.</p>.<p>Staging may require lab tests. It also may involve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">endoscopy</a>. The doctor uses a thin, lighted tube (endoscope) to check your throat, windpipe, and lungs. 
The endoscope may be flexible or rigid. The doctor inserts the endoscope through your nose or mouth. Local anesthesia is used to ease your discomfort and prevent you from gagging. Some people also may have a mild sedative. Sometimes the doctor uses general anesthesia to put a person to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. This exam may be done in a doctor's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital.</p>.<p>The doctor may order one or more imaging tests to learn whether the cancer has spread:</p>.<p>Many people with oral cancer want to take an active part in making decisions about their medical care. It is natural to want to learn all you can about your disease and your treatment choices. However, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shock</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> after the diagnosis can make it hard to think of everything you want to ask the doctor. It often helps to make a list of questions before an appointment. To help remember what the doctor says, you may take notes or ask whether you may use a tape recorder. You may also want to have a family member or friend with you when you talk to the doctor - to take part in the discussion, to take notes, or just to listen.</p>.<p>Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat oral cancer include oral and maxillofacial surgeons, otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors), medical oncologists, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> oncologists, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> surgeons. You may be referred to a team that includes specialists in surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Other health care professionals who may work with the specialists as a team include a dentist, speech pathologist, nutritionist, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mental health</a> counselor.</p>.<p>Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about the diagnosis and the treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion; others may cover a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Do not be afraid to ask for a second opinion. These are serious conditions and you may want to learn about your diagnosis and treatment options from more than one source. Your doctor should not be offended if you ask for a second opinion, and can help you to arrange it, if asked.</p>.<p>There are a number of ways to find a doctor for a second opinion:</p>.<p>You may want to ask the doctor these questions before treatment begins:</p>.<p>The choice of treatment depends mainly on your general health, where in your mouth or oropharynx the cancer began, the size of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread. Your doctor can describe your treatment choices and the expected results. You will want to consider how treatment may affect normal activities such as swallowing and talking, and whether it will change the way you look. You and your doctor can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs and personal values.</p>.<p>You do not need to ask all your questions or understand all the answers at once. You will have other chances to ask your doctor to explain things that are not clear and to ask for more information.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="methods_of_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Oral cancer treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments.</p>.<p>At any stage of disease, people with oral cancer may have treatment to control pain and other symptoms, to relieve the side effects of therapy, and to ease emotional and practical problems. This kind of treatment is called supportive care, symptom management, or palliative care. Information about supportive care is available on NCI's Web site at <a onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" href="http://cancer.gov" target="_blank">http://cancer.gov</a> and from NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.</p>.<p>You may want to talk to the doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. The section on "The Promise of Cancer Research" has more information about clinical trials.</p>.<p>Surgery to remove the tumor in the mouth or throat is a common treatment for oral cancer. Sometimes the surgeon also removes lymph nodes in the neck. Other tissues in the mouth and neck may be removed as well. Patients may have surgery alone or in combination with radiation therapy.</p>.<p>You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having surgery:</p>.<p>Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is a type of local therapy. It affects cells only in the treated area. Radiation therapy is used alone for small tumors or for patients who cannot have surgery. It may be used before surgery to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor. It also may be used after surgery to destroy cancer cells that may remain in the area.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Doctors use two types of radiation therapy to treat oral cancer:</p>.<p>Some people with oral cancer have both kinds of radiation therapy.</p>.<p>You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having radiation therapy:</p>.<p>Chemotherapy uses anticancer <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> to kill cancer cells. It is called systemic therapy because it enters the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body. 
A new targeted therapy called cetuximab, which blocks a growth factor upon which 
cancer cells may depend, is being used today, either alone or in combination 
with radiation and older chemotherapy drugs.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is usually given by injection. It may be given in an outpatient part of the hospital, at the doctor's office, or at home. Rarely, a hospital stay may be needed.</p>.<p>You may want to ask the doctor these questions before having chemotherapy:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_side_effects_of_treatment_for_oral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because treatment often damages healthy cells and tissues, unwanted side effects are common. These side effects depend mainly on the location of the tumor and the type and extent of the treatment. Side effects may not be the same for each person, and they may even change from one treatment session to the next. Before treatment starts, your health care team will explain possible side effects and suggest ways to help you manage them.</p>.<p>The NCI provides helpful booklets about cancer treatments and coping with side effects. Booklets such as <i>Radiation Therapy and You</i>, <i>Chemotherapy and You</i>, and <i>Eating Hints for Cancer Patients</i> may be viewed, downloaded, and ordered from http://cancer.gov/publications. These materials also may be ordered by calling the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.</p>.<p>The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) also provides helpful materials. <i>Head and Neck Radiation Treatment and Your Mouth</i>, <i>Chemotherapy and Your Mouth</i>, and other booklets are available from NIDCR. See "National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Information Resources" for a list of publications.</p>.<p>It takes time to heal after surgery, and the time needed to recover is different for each person. You may be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control the pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your doctor or nurse. After surgery, your doctor can adjust the plan if you need more pain relief.</p>.<p>It is common to feel tired or weak for a while. Also, surgery may cause tissues in your face to swell. This swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, removing lymph nodes can result in swelling that lasts a long time.</p>.<p>Surgery to remove a small tumor in the mouth may not cause any lasting problems. For a larger tumor, however, the surgeon may remove part of the palate, tongue, or jaw. This surgery may change your ability to chew, swallow, or talk. Also, your face may look different after surgery. Reconstructive or plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth. (See "Reconstruction.")</p>.<p>Almost all patients who have radiation therapy to the head and neck area develop oral side effects. That is why it is important to get the mouth in good condition before cancer treatment begins. Seeing a dentist two weeks before cancer treatment begins gives the mouth time to heal after dental work.</p>.<p>The side effects of radiation therapy depend mainly on the amount of radiation given. Some side effects in the mouth go away after radiation treatment ends, while others last a long time. A few side effects (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dry mouth</a>) may never go away.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy may cause some or all of these side effects:</p>.<p>Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be distressing, your doctor can usually treat or control them. It helps to report any problems that you are having so that your doctor can work with you to relieve them.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause some of the same side effects, including 
skin rashes, painful mouth and gums, dry mouth, infection, and changes in taste. Some anticancer drugs can also cause bleeding in the mouth and a deep pain 
in the jaw that feels like a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/toothache_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">toothache</a>. The problems you have depend on the type and amount of anticancer drugs you receive, and how your body reacts to them. You may have these problems only during treatment or for a short time after treatment ends.</p>.<p>Generally, anticancer drugs affect cells that divide rapidly. In addition to cancer cells, these rapidly dividing cells include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_rehabilitation_for_oral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eating well  during cancer treatment means getting enough calories and protein to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>, regain strength, and rebuild healthy tissues. But eating well may be difficult after treatment for oral cancer. Some people with cancer find it hard to eat because they lose their appetite. They may not feel like eating because they are uncomfortable or tired. A dry or sore mouth or changes in smell and taste also may make eating difficult.</p>.<p>If your mouth is dry, you may find that soft foods moistened with sauces or gravies are easier to eat. Thick soups, puddings, and milkshakes often are easier to swallow. Nurses and dietitians can help you choose the right foods. Also, the National Cancer Institute booklet <i>Eating Hints for Cancer Patients</i> contains many useful ideas and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/recipes/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">recipes</a>. The "National Cancer Institute Information Resources" section tells how to get this publication.</p>.<p>After surgery or radiation therapy for oral cancer, some people need a feeding tube. A feeding tube is a flexible plastic tube that is passed into the stomach through an incision in the abdomen. In almost all cases, the tube is temporary. Most people gradually return to a regular diet.</p>.<p>To protect your mouth during cancer treatment, it helps to avoid:</p>.<p>Some people with oral cancer may need to have plastic or reconstructive surgery to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth. Research has led to many advances in the way bones and tissues can be replaced.</p>.<p>Some people may need dental implants. Or they may need to have grafts (tissue moved from another part of the body). Skin, muscle, and bone can be moved to the oral cavity from the chest, arm, or leg. The plastic surgeon uses this tissue for repair.</p>.<p>If you are thinking about reconstruction, you may wish to consult with a plastic or reconstructive surgeon before your treatment begins. You can have reconstructive surgery at the same time as you have the cancer removed, or you can have it later on. Talk with your doctor about which approach is right for you.</p>.<p>The health care team will help you return to normal activities as soon as possible. The goals of rehabilitation depend on the extent of the disease and type of treatment. Rehabilitation may include being fitted with a dental prosthesis (an artificial dental device) and having dental implants. It also may involve speech therapy, dietary counseling, or other services.</p>.<p>Sometimes surgery to rebuild the bones or tissues of the mouth is not possible. A dentist with special training (a prosthodontist) may be able to make you a prosthesis to help you eat and talk normally. You may need special training to learn to use it.</p>.<p>If oral cancer or its treatment leads to problems with talking, speech therapy will generally begin as soon as possible. A speech therapist may see you in the hospital to plan therapy and teach speech exercises. Often speech therapy continues after you return home.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_after_treatment_for_oral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Follow-up care after treatment for oral cancer is important. Even when the cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained in the body after treatment. The doctor monitors your recovery and checks for recurrence of cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted. Your doctor will probably encourage you to inspect your mouth regularly and continue to have exams when you visit your dentist. It is important to report any changes in your mouth right away.</p>.<p>Checkups include exams of the mouth, throat, and neck. From time to time, your doctor may do a complete physical exam, order blood tests, and take x-rays.</p>.<p>People who have had oral cancer have a chance of developing a new cancer in the mouth, throat, or other areas of the head and neck. This is especially true for those who use tobacco or who drink alcohol heavily. Doctors strongly urge their patients to 
STOP using tobacco and drinking to cut down the risk of a new cancer and other health problems.</p>.<p>The NCI has prepared a booklet for people who have completed their treatment to help answer questions about follow-up care and other concerns. <i>Facing Forward Series: Life After Cancer Treatment</i> provides tips for making the best use of medical visits. It describes how to talk to your health care team about creating a plan of action for recovery and future health.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_the_future_hold_for_patients_with_oral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Living with a serious disease such as oral cancer is not easy. You may worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities. You may have concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills. Doctors, nurses, and other members of the health care team can answer your questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Meeting with a social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or discuss your concerns. Often, a social worker can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support.</p>.<p>Support groups also can help. In these groups, patients or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group. The NCI's fact sheets "Cancer Support Groups: Questions and Answers" and "National Organizations That Offer Services to People With Cancer and Their Families" tell how to find a support group. See "National Cancer Institute Information Resources" for ordering information.</p>.<p>The Cancer Information Service can provide information to help patients and their families locate programs, services, and publications.</p>.<p>Doctors all over the country are conducting many types of clinical trials. These are research studies in which people volunteer to take part. In clinical trials, doctors are testing new ways to treat oral cancer. Research has already led to advances, and researchers continue to search for more effective approaches.</p>.<p>People who join clinical trials may be among the first to benefit if a new approach is shown to be effective. And if participants do not benefit directly, they still make an important contribution to medical science by helping doctors learn more about the disease and how to control it. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, researchers do all they can to protect their patients.</p>.<p>Researchers are testing anticancer drugs and combinations of drugs. They are studying radiation therapy combined with drugs and other treatments. They also are testing drugs that prevent or reduce the side effects of radiation therapy.</p>.<p>If you are interested in learning more about joining a clinical trial, you may want to talk with your doctor. You may want to read Taking Part in Clinical Trials: What Cancer Patients Need To Know. The NCI also offers an easy-to-read brochure called If You Have Cancer...What You Should Know About Clinical Trials.
