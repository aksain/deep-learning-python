However, patients may use different words to describe the pain, including pain, heaviness, tightness, ache, and fullness. The location may or may not be in the chest; instead it may be described in the upper abdomen, back, arms, shoulder, or neck.</p>.<p>Typical angina symptoms should be made worse with activity and should resolve or get better with rest.</p>.<p>Angina may not have any pain and instead may present as shortness of breath with exercise, malaise, fatigue, or weakness. Patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> have an altered sensation of pain and may have markedly atypical symptoms. Women may not have the same angina constellation of symptoms as men.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_angina" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The heart gets its blood supply from coronary arteries that branch off the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/aorta_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">aorta</a> just as it leaves the heart. The coronary arteries run along the surface of the heart, branching into smaller and smaller blood vessels as they supple each muscle cell of the heart. The most common reason a patient complains of angina is because of narrowed coronary arteries caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atherosclerotic</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">heart disease</a> (ASHD).</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cholesterol</a> plaque gradually builds on the inner lining of a coronary artery, narrowing its diameter and decreasing the amount of blood that can flow past the blockage. If the heart is asked to do more work and pump harder and faster, enough oxygen may not be able to be delivered beyond the blockage to meet the energy demand of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">myocardium</a> and this can cause the symptoms of angina to occur.</p>.<p>If a plaque ruptures, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> may form that completely occludes the coronary artery and prevents any blood flow to the section of the heart muscle that the artery supplies. This is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction and is a medical emergency. Heart muscle that loses its blood supply will die and be replaced with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar tissue</a> that is unable to contract. This may decrease the heart's ability to pump as strongly as before. As well, heart muscle that loses its blood supply can become irritable and result in heart rhythm disturbances like ventricular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fibrillation</a> or ventricular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_flutter/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flutter</a> that can result in sudden cardiac death.</p>.<p>Because each beat of the heart not only sends blood to the body, but also to itself, there are a variety of systems in the body and within the heart that have to function normally to deliver oxygen to the heart muscle. Should any of them, either individually or in combination, fail to perform adequately, angina may occur. Examples include the following:</p>.<p>If any of these steps fail, the heart muscle may not get enough oxygen and the patient may feel pain or discomfort called angina.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_angina" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Angina due to a decrease or lack of coronary artery blood flow</b></p>.<p>Angina is most often caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries because of atherosclerotic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">heart disease</a>. There may be one or more arteries that are blocked and the amount of pain or other symptom severity is not necessarily related to the number of blood vessels blocked. Usually, there has to be at least a 50% narrowing of a coronary artery to cause symptoms.</p>.<p>Prinzmetal angina describes pain that is caused when a coronary artery goes into spasm temporarily decreasing blood supply to a section of heart muscle.</p>.<p>Microvascular angina describes narrowing of small arteries to cause areas of the heart to have decreased blood flow. The large coronary arteries may be normal.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metabolic_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Syndrome X</a> cardiac disease describes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle with normal coronary arteries not caused by the vasospasm that is seen in Prinzmetal angina. This may be a variant of microvascular angina.</p>.<p>Rare causes may also include abnormalities that occur with the coronary arteries that are not due to ASHD including scarring that can occur from chest <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a>, inflammation of the arteries because of underlying illness like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scleroderma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scleroderma</a>, and Kawasaki's disease, as well as congenital abnormalities affecting coronary artery anatomy.</p>.<p><b>Other causes of angina</b></p>.<p>Some causes for angina are multifactorial. For example, a patient with atherosclerotic heart disease may become acutely ill or injured, where a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a> or anemia may compound the inability of narrowed blood vessels to deliver oxygen to heart muscle cells. Or a patient who abuses cocaine can increase heart rate plus cause coronary arteries to constrict, leading to angina.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_angina_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The preliminary diagnosis of angina usually is made by the patient's history. The health care professional needs to understand what symptoms the patient is experiencing and may ask similar questions in a variety of ways to gain that understanding. This may be a frustrating process for both patient and professional because the symptoms of angina can range from classic to vague.</p>.<p>Part of the history will be to assess risk factors for heart disease.

Questions may be asked to determine whether other possibilities other than angina exist. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_embolism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Pulmonary embolism</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">aortic aneurysm</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">GERD</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peptic_ulcer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">peptic ulcer</a> disease, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gallbladder_pain_gall_bladder_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gallbladder disease</a> are bit a few of the potential causes of symptoms other than angina.</p>.<p>Physical examination will help narrow the potential list of diseases but in of itself, will not make the formal diagnosis.</p>.<p>This is the time that the health care professional has to make a clinical decision as to the source of symptoms. If the tentative or provisional diagnosis is angina, a further decision has to be made whether it is stable or unstable.</p>.<p>With <b>stable angina</b>, a defined exercise will bring on the symptoms and rest will make it better. For example, a patient gets chest discomfort after walking 2 miles and it gets better with 5 minutes of rest. The pain pattern is constant and the amount of exercise required to bring on the symptoms has not been getting shorter. Often a patient with known angina will take a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitroglycerin</a> pill to resolve the pain and it does so promptly.</p>.<p><b>Unstable angina</b> usually happens at rest, wakens the patient at night, or comes on with minimal activity. These are times when the heart muscle is not being asked to work harder and yet angina symptoms may be present. Unstable angina is a potential warning sign of impending heart attack. There may be a transition from stable to unstable and the patient may describe decreasing amounts of exertion needed to bring on the angina symptoms.</p>.<p>Over time, a patient with angina may have their symptoms brought on by less and less activity. This progression needs to be monitored closely by both patient and doctor. The frequency of nitroglycerin use may be a clue that a coronary artery might be getting critically narrow increasing the risk of heart attack.</p>.<p>If angina is the major consideration, then an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrocardiogram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EKG</a>) is usually performed. The electrical signal tracing of the heart can be interpreted to decide if heart muscle is damaged. The initial EKGs most important function is to decide if the patient is in the midst of suffering a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI). This is a medical emergency.</p>.<p>If the EKG does not show a new heart attack and if the patient has stable symptoms, the next step depends upon the situation. Blood tests may be done to check cardiac enzymes. These are chemicals (troponin, CPK, myoglobin) contained in heart muscle cells that may leak into the bloodstream if the cell is injured. If the chemicals are not detected, then the presumption is that if the pain is due to ASHD, critical narrowing has not caused heart muscle damage. However, the tests need to be done and interpreted based upon the clinical situation.</p>.<p>With a stable EKG, resolved symptoms, and concern still present that the patient has angina, tests to image the heart may be considered. These may include one or more of the following: stress tests, nuclear imaging, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">echocardiogram</a>, cardiac <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a>, and heart catheterization. The decision as to what test is most appropriate depends upon the patient, their symptoms, underlying health, risk factors, and the level of concern of the health care professional.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_angina" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for angina depends upon the cause and may include behavior modification, exercise, medication, and surgery.</p>.<p>Should the cause be ASHD, medications may be used to help minimize progression of artery narrowing and plaque buildup. Medications can be also be used to decrease the oxygen requirements of the heart and to allow the heart muscle to function more efficiently.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aspirin</a> may be recommended to make platelets less sticky to prevent clot formation and prevent heart attack.</p>.<p>Long-acting nitroglycerin medications (Imdur, Nitropaste) may be prescribed to dilate coronary arteries and increase blood flow to the heart muscle. As well, nitroglycerin may be used to abort an episode of angina.

Ultrafast CT scanning is useful in evaluating chest pain in younger patients (men under 40 and women under 50 years old). Since young people do not normally have significant coronary artery plaque, a negative calcium score makes the diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coronary artery disease</a> unlikely. However, finding calcium by this method is less meaningful in older patients who are likely to have mild plaquing simply from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> process.</p>.<p>Even though a calcium score is useful in detecting calcium in plaque, it cannot determine whether the calcium-laden plaque actually causes artery narrowing and reduces blood flow.
