Shiel Jr., MD, FACP, FACR</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_frontotemporal_dementia_picks_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) describes a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Originally known as Pick's disease, the name and classification of frontotemporal dementia has been a topic of discussion for over a century. The current designation of the syndrome groups together Pick's disease, primary progressive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aphasia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aphasia</a>, and semantic dementia as frontotemporal dementia. Some doctors propose adding <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/corticobasal_degeneration_cbd_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corticobasal degeneration</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/progressive_supranuclear_palsy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">progressive supranuclear palsy</a> to frontotemporal dementia and calling the group Pick Complex. These designations will continue to be debated. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_frontotemporal_dementia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As it is defined today, the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia fall into two clinical patterns that involve either (1) changes in behavior, or (2) problems with language.</p>.<p>The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive (disinhibited) or bored and listless (apathetic) and includes</p>.<p>The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral type's symptoms.   Spatial skills and memory remain intact.  
</p>.<p><b><a name="is_frontotemporal_dementia_inherited" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is a strong genetic component to the disease; frontotemporal dementia often runs in families. 
</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_treatment_for_frontotemporal_dementia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of frontotemporal dementia. Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Antidepressants</a> have been shown to improve some symptoms. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_the_outlook_for_frontotemporal_dementia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The outcome for people with frontotemporal dementia is poor.  The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others.  Eventually some individuals with frontotemporal dementia will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_research_is_being_done_on_frontotemporal_dementia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
