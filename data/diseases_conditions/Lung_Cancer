<p>Cancer of the lung, like all cancers, results from an abnormality in the body's basic unit of life, the cell. Normally, the body maintains a system of checks and balances on cell growth so that cells divide to produce new cells only when new cells are needed. Disruption of this system of checks and balances on cell growth results in an uncontrolled division and proliferation of cells that eventually forms a mass known as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a>.</p>.<p>Tumors can be benign or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a>; when we speak of "cancer," we are referring to those tumors that are malignant. Benign tumors usually can be removed and do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, often grow aggressively locally where they start, but tumor cells also can enter into the bloodstream or lymphatic system and then spread to other sites in the body. This process of spread is termed <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a></i>; the areas of tumor growth at these distant sites are called <i>metastases</i>. Since lung cancer tends to spread or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasize</a> very early after it forms, it is a very life-threatening cancer and one of the most difficult cancers to treat. While lung cancer can spread to any organ in the body, certain locations -- particularly the adrenal glands, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, brain, and bones -- are the most common sites for lung cancer metastasis.</p>.<p>The lung also is a very common site for metastasis from malignant tumors in other parts of the body. Tumor metastases are made up of the same types of cells as the original (primary) tumor. For example, if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostate cancer</a> spreads via the bloodstream to the lungs, it is metastatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">prostate cancer</a> in the lung and is not lung cancer.</p>.<p>The principal function of the lungs is to exchange gases between the air we breathe and the blood. Through the lung, carbon dioxide is removed from the bloodstream and oxygen enters the bloodstream. The right lung has three lobes, while the left lung is divided into two lobes and a small structure called the lingula that is the equivalent of the middle lobe on the right. The major airways entering the lungs are the bronchi, which arise from the trachea, which is outside the lungs. The bronchi branch into progressively smaller airways called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/bronchioles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">bronchioles</a> that end in tiny sacs known as alveoli where gas exchange occurs. The lungs and chest wall are covered with a thin layer of tissue called the pleura.</p>.<p>Lung cancers can arise in any part of the lung, but 90%-95% of cancers of the lung are thought to arise from the epithelial cells, the cells lining the larger and smaller airways (bronchi and bronchioles); for this reason, lung cancers are sometimes called bronchogenic cancers or bronchogenic carcinomas. (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Carcinoma</a> is another term for cancer.) Cancers also can arise from the pleura (called mesotheliomas) or rarely from supporting tissues within the lungs, for example, the blood vessels.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of death due to cancer in both men and women throughout the world. Statistics from the American Cancer Society estimated that in 2018 there will be about 244,000 new cases of lung cancer in the U.S. occurred and over 154,000 deaths were due to the disease. According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, approximately 6.5% of men and women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer of the lung at some point in their lifetime based on data from 2011-13.</p>.<p>Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly; almost 70% of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 65 years of age, while less than 3% of lung cancers occur in people under 45 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is 70 years.</p>.<p>Lung cancer was not common prior to the 1930s but increased dramatically over the following decades as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">tobacco smoking</a> increased. In many developing countries, the incidence of lung cancer is beginning to fall following public education about the dangers of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/quit_smoking_tips_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cigarette smoking</a> and the introduction of effective <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a>-cessation programs. Nevertheless, lung cancer remains among the most common types of cancers in both men and women worldwide. In the U.S., lung cancer has surpassed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast cancer</a> as the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The incidence of lung cancer is strongly correlated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cigarette smoking</a>, with about 90% of lung cancers arising as a result of tobacco use. The risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked and the time over which <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">smoking</a> has occurred; doctors refer to this risk in terms of pack-years of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">smoking</a> history (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked). For example, a person who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history. While the risk of lung cancer is increased with even a 10-pack-year smoking history, those with 30-pack-year histories or more are considered to have the greatest risk for the development of lung cancer. Among those who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes per day, one in seven will die of lung cancer.</p>.<p>Pipe and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cigar</a> smoking also can cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cigarette</a> smoking. Thus, while someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smokers</a> have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker.</p>.<p>Tobacco smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, many of which have been shown to be cancer-causing or carcinogenic. The two primary carcinogens in tobacco smoke are chemicals known as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The risk of developing lung cancer decreases each year following smoking cessation as normal cells grow and replace damaged cells in the lung. In former smokers, the risk of developing lung cancer begins to approach that of a nonsmoker about 15 years after cessation of smoking.</p>.<p>Passive smoking or the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inhalation</a> of tobacco smoke by nonsmokers who share living or working quarters with smokers, also is an established risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung cancer when compared with nonsmokers who do not reside with a smoker. The risk appears to increase with the degree of exposure (number of years exposed and number of cigarettes smoked by the household partner) to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/secondhand_smoke/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">secondhand smoke</a>. It is estimated that over 7,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U.S. that are attributable to passive smoking.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asbestos-related_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Asbestos</a> fibers are silicate fibers that can persist for a lifetime in lung tissue following exposure to asbestos. The workplace was a common source of exposure to asbestos fibers, as asbestos was widely used in the past as both thermal and acoustic insulation. Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries, including the U.S. Both lung cancer and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mesothelioma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mesothelioma</a> (cancer of the pleura of the lung as well as of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in workers exposed to asbestos; asbestos workers who do not smoke have a fivefold greater risk of developing lung cancer than nonsmokers, but asbestos workers who smoke have a risk that is fifty- to ninety-fold greater than nonsmokers.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radon_symptoms_poisoning_tests_cancer_causes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Radon</a> gas is a natural radioactive gas that is a natural decay product of uranium that emits a type of ionizing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a>. Radon gas is a known cause of lung cancer, with an estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon gas, or about 21,000 lung-cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S., making radon the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. after smoking. As with asbestos exposure, concomitant smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure. Radon gas can travel up through soil and enter homes through gaps in the foundation, pipes, drains, or other openings. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that one out of every 15 homes in the U.S. contains dangerous levels of radon gas. Radon gas is invisible and odorless, but it can be detected with simple test kits.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>While the majority of lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, the fact that not all smokers eventually develop lung cancer suggests that other factors, such as individual genetic susceptibility, may play a role in the causation of lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population. It is unclear how much of this risk is due to shared environmental factors (like a smoking household) and how much is related to genetic risk. People who inherit certain genes, like genes that interfere with DNA repair, may be at greater risk for several types of cancer. Tests to identify people at increased genetic risk of lung cancer are not yet available for routine use.</p>.<p>The presence of certain diseases of the lung, notably <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">COPD</a>), is associated with an increased risk (four- to six-fold the risk of a nonsmoker) for the development of lung cancer even after the effects of concomitant cigarette smoking are excluded. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_fibrosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Pulmonary fibrosis</a> (scarring of the lung) appears to increase the risk about seven-fold, and this risk does not appear to be related to smoking.</p>.<p>Survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk of developing a second lung cancer than the general population has of developing a first lung cancer. Survivors of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs, see below) have an additive risk of 1%-2% per year for developing a second lung cancer. In survivors of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs, see below), the risk for development of second lung cancers approaches 6% per year.</p>.<p>Air pollution from vehicles, industry, and power plants can raise the likelihood of developing lung cancer in exposed individuals. Up to 1%-2% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> polluted air, and experts believe that prolonged exposure to highly polluted air can carry a risk for the development of lung cancer similar to that of passive smoking.</p>.<p>Exhaust from diesel engines is made up of gases and soot (particulate matter). Many occupations, such as truck drivers, toll booth workers, forklift and other heavy machinery operators, railroad and dock workers, miners, garage workers and mechanics, and some farm workers are frequently exposed to diesel exhaust. Studies of workers exposed to diesel exhaust have shown a small but significant increase in the risk of developing lung cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Lung cancers, also known as bronchogenic carcinomas because they arise from the bronchi within the lungs, are broadly classified into two types: small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). This classification is based upon the microscopic appearance of the tumor cells themselves, specifically the size of the cells. These two types of cancers grow and spread in different ways and may have different treatment options, so a distinction between these two types is important.</p>.<p>SCLC comprise about 20% of lung cancers and are the most aggressive and rapidly growing of all lung cancers. SCLC are strongly related to cigarette smoking, with only 1% of these tumors occurring in nonsmokers. SCLC metastasize rapidly to many sites within the body and are most often discovered after they have spread extensively. Referring to a specific cell appearance often seen when examining samples of SCLC under the microscope, these cancers are sometimes called oat cell carcinomas.</p>.<p>NSCLC are the most common lung cancers, accounting for about 80% of all lung cancers. NSCLC can be divided into several main types that are named based upon the type of cells found in the tumor:</p>.<p><b>Other types of cancers</b> can arise in the lung; these types are much less common than NSCLC and SCLC and together comprise only 5%-10% of lung cancers:</p>.<p>As discussed previously, metastatic cancers from other primary tumors in the body are often found in the lung. Tumors from anywhere in the body may spread to the lungs either through the bloodstream, through the lymphatic system, or directly from nearby organs. Metastatic tumors are most often multiple, scattered throughout the lung, and concentrated in the peripheral rather than central areas of the lung.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Symptoms of lung cancer</a> are varied depending upon where and how widespread the tumor is. Warning signs of lung cancer are not always present or easy to identify. Lung cancer may not cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> or other symptoms in some cases. A person with lung cancer may have the following kinds of symptoms:</p>.<p>One should consult a health care professional if he or she develops the symptoms associated with lung cancer, in particular, if they have</p>.<p>The treatment of lung cancer requires a team approach. Surgical oncologists are surgeons specialized in the removal of cancers. Thoracic surgeons or general surgeons may also surgically treat lung cancers. Medical and radiation oncologists are specialists in the treatment of cancers with medications and radiation therapy, respectively. Other specialists who may be involved in the care of people with lung cancer include pain and palliative care specialists, as well as pulmonary specialists (medical pulmonologists). </p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Doctors use a wide range of diagnostic procedures and tests to diagnose lung cancer. These include the following:</p>.<p>The stage of a cancer is a measure of the extent to which a cancer has spread in the body. Staging involves evaluation of a cancer's size and its penetration into surrounding tissue as well as the presence or absence of metastases in the lymph nodes or other organs. Staging is important for determining how a particular cancer should be treated, since lung cancer therapies are geared toward specific stages. Staging of a cancer also is critical in estimating the prognosis of a given patient, with higher-stage cancers generally having a worse prognosis than lower-stage cancers.</p>.<p>Doctors may use several tests to accurately stage a lung cancer, including laboratory (blood chemistry) tests, X-rays, CT scans, bone scans, MRI scans, and PET scans. Abnormal blood chemistry tests may signal the presence of metastases in bone or liver, and radiological procedures can document the size of a cancer as well as its spread.</p>.<p>NSCLC are assigned a stage from I to IV in order of severity:</p>.<p>Most doctors use a two-tiered system to determine treatment for SCLC:</p>.<p>Treatment for lung cancer primarily involves surgical removal of the cancer, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, as well as combinations of these treatments. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy are becoming more common, as well. The decision about which treatments will be appropriate for a given individual must take into account the location and extent of the tumor, as well as the overall health status of the patient.</p>.<p>As with other cancers, therapy may be prescribed that is intended to be curative (removal or eradication of a cancer) or palliative (measures that are unable to cure a cancer but can reduce pain and suffering). More than one type of therapy may be prescribed. In such cases, the therapy that is added to enhance the effects of the primary therapy is referred to as adjuvant therapy. An example of adjuvant therapy is chemotherapy or radiotherapy administered after surgical removal of a tumor in an attempt to kill any tumor cells that remain following surgery.</p>.<p><b>Surgery</b>: Surgical removal of the tumor is generally performed for limited-stage (stage I or sometimes stage II) NSCLC and is the treatment of choice for cancer that has not spread beyond the lung. About 10%-35% of lung cancers can be removed surgically, but removal does not always result in a cure, since the tumors may already have spread and can recur at a later time. Among people who have an isolated, slow-growing lung cancer removed, 25%-40% are still alive five years after diagnosis. It is important to note that although a tumor may be anatomically suitable for resection, surgery may not be possible if the person has other serious conditions (such as severe heart or lung disease) that would limit their ability to survive an operation. Surgery is less often performed with SCLC than with NSCLC because these tumors are less likely to be localized to one area that can be removed.</p>.<p>The surgical procedure chosen depends upon the size and location of the tumor. Surgeons must open the chest wall and may perform a wedge resection of the lung (removal of a portion of one lobe), a lobectomy (removal of one lobe), or a pneumonectomy (removal of an entire lung). Sometimes lymph nodes in the region of the lungs also are removed (lymphadenectomy). Surgery for lung cancer is a major surgical procedure that requires general anesthesia, hospitalization, and follow-up care for weeks to months. Following the surgical procedure, patients may experience difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, pain, and weakness. The risks of surgery include complications due to bleeding, infection, and complications of general anesthesia.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b>Radiation</b>: Radiation therapy may be employed as a treatment for both NSCLC and SCLC. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill dividing cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be given as curative therapy, palliative therapy (using lower doses of radiation than with curative therapy), or as adjuvant therapy in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. The radiation is either delivered externally, by using a machine that directs radiation toward the cancer, or internally through placement of radioactive substances in sealed containers within the area of the body where the tumor is localized. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brachytherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Brachytherapy</a> is a term used to describe the use of a small pellet of radioactive material placed directly into the cancer or into the airway next to the cancer. This is usually done through a bronchoscope.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy can be given if a person refuses surgery, if a tumor has spread to areas such as the lymph nodes or trachea making surgical removal impossible, or if a person has other conditions that make them too ill to undergo major surgery. Radiation therapy generally only shrinks a tumor or limits its growth when given as a sole therapy, yet in 10%-15% of people it leads to long-term remission and palliation of the cancer. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy can further prolong survival when chemotherapy is administered. A person who has severe lung disease in addition to a lung cancer may not be able to receive radiotherapy to the lung since the radiation can further decrease function of the lungs. A type of external radiation therapy called the "gamma knife" is sometimes used to treat single brain metastases. In this procedure, multiple beams of radiation coming from different directions are focused on the tumor over a few minutes to hours while the head is held in place by a rigid frame. This reduces the dose of radiation that is received by noncancerous tissues.</p>.<p>For external radiation therapy, a process called simulation is necessary prior to treatment. Using CT scans, computers, and precise measurements, simulation maps out the exact location where the radiation will be delivered, called the treatment field or port. This process usually takes 30 minutes to two hours. The external radiation treatment itself generally is done four or five days a week for several weeks.</p>.<p>SCLC often spreads to the brain. Sometimes people with SCLC that is responding well to treatment are treated with radiation therapy to the head to treat very early spread to the brain (called micrometastasis) that is not yet detectable with CT or MRI scans and has not yet produced symptoms. This is known as prophylactic brain radiation. Brain radiation therapy can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">short-term memory</a> problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, and other side effects.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy does not carry the risks of major surgery, but it can have unpleasant side effects, including fatigue and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lack of energy</a>. A reduced white blood cell count (rendering a person more susceptible to infection) and low blood platelet levels (making blood clotting more difficult and resulting in excessive bleeding) also can occur with radiation therapy. If the digestive organs are in the field exposed to radiation, patients may experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>. Radiation therapy can irritate the skin in the area that is treated, but this irritation generally improves with time after treatment has ended.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b>Chemotherapy</b>: Both NSCLC and SCLC may be treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy refers to the administration of drugs that stop the growth of cancer cells by killing them or preventing them from dividing. Chemotherapy may be given alone, as an adjuvant to surgical therapy, or in combination with radiotherapy. While a number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been developed, the class of drugs known as the platinum-based drugs have been the most effective in treatment of lung cancers.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for most SCLC, since these tumors are generally widespread in the body when they are diagnosed. Only half of people who have SCLC survive for four months without chemotherapy. With chemotherapy, their survival time is increased up to four- to fivefold. Chemotherapy alone is not particularly effective in treating NSCLC, but when NSCLC has metastasized, it can prolong survival in many cases.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy may be given as pills, as an intravenous infusion, or as a combination of the two. Chemotherapy treatments usually are given in an outpatient setting. A combination of drugs is given in a series of treatments, called cycles, over a period of weeks to months, with breaks in between cycles. Unfortunately, the drugs used in chemotherapy also kill normally dividing cells in the body, resulting in unpleasant side effects. Damage to blood cells can result in increased susceptibility to infections and difficulties with blood clotting (bleeding or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a> easily). Other side effects include fatigue, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weight loss</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hair loss</a>, nausea, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/canker_sores/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mouth sores</a>. The side effects of chemotherapy vary according to the dosage and combination of drugs used and may also vary from individual to individual. Medications have been developed that can treat or prevent many of the side effects of chemotherapy. The side effects generally disappear during the recovery phase of the treatment or after its completion.</p>.<p><b>Targeted therapy</b>: Molecularly targeted therapy involves the administration of drugs that have been identified to work in subsets of patients whose tumors have specific genetic changes (driver mutations) that promote tumor growth.</p>.<p><strong>EGFR-targeted therapies</strong>: The drugs <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erlotinib/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">erlotinib</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erlotinib/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tarceva</a>), afatinib (Gilotrif), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gefitinib/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">gefitinib</a> (Iressa) are so-called targeted drugs that more specifically target cancer cells, resulting in less damage to normal cells than general chemotherapeutic agents. Erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib target a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is important in promoting the division of cells. The gene encoding this protein is mutated in many cases of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">non-small cell lung cancer</a>, creating a mutation that encourages tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR gene are more common in cancers in women and in people who have never smoked. Drugs that target the EGFR receptor sometimes stop working after a time, which is known as resistance to the drug. Resistance often occurs because the cancer has developed a new mutation in the same gene, and a common example of this is the so-called EGFR T790M mutation. Some newer EGFR-targeted drugs also work against cells with the T790M mutation, including osimertinib (Tagrisso). Necitumumab (Portrazza) is another drug that targets EGFR. It can be used along with chemotherapy as the first treatment in people with advanced NSCLC of the squamous cell type.</p>.<p><strong>Other targeted </strong><strong>therapies</strong>: Other targeted drugs are available that target other driver mutations. These other targeted therapies include the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs crizotinib (Xalkori), alectinib (Alecensa), brigatinib (Alunbrig), and ceritinib (Zykadia) that are used in patients whose tumors have an abnormality of the ALK gene as the driver mutation. Some of these drugs may also be helpful for people whose cancers have an abnormality of the gene known as ROS1.</p>.<p>The gene known as BRAF can also be abnormal in lung cancers causing the production of BRAF protein that promotes the cancer's growth. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) is a type of drug known as a BRAF inhibitor and attacks the BRAF protein directly. Trametinib (Mekinist) is known as a MEK inhibitor because it attacks MEK proteins, which are related to BRAF proteins. These may be used for patients with tumors that have abnormal BRAF genes.</p>.<p>Other attempts at targeted therapy include drugs known as antiangiogenesis drugs, which block the development of new blood vessels within a cancer. Without adequate blood vessels to supply oxygen-carrying blood, the cancer cells will die. The antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bevacizumab-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Avastin</a>) has also been found to prolong survival in advanced lung cancer when it is added to the standard chemotherapy regimen. Bevacizumab is given intravenously every two to three weeks. However, since this drug may cause bleeding, it is not appropriate for use in patients who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a> up blood, if the lung cancer has spread to the brain, or in people who are receiving anticoagulation therapy ("blood thinner" medications). Bevacizumab also is not used in cases of squamous cell cancer because it leads to bleeding from this type of lung cancer. Ramucirumab (Cyramza) is another angiogenesis inhibitor that can be used to treat advanced non-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">small cell lung cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b>Immunotherapy</b>: Immunotherapy may be an effective option for some patients with advanced lung cancers. Immunotherapy drugs work by strengthening the activity of the immune system against tumor cells. The immunotherapy drugs nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) were approved by the U.S. FDA in 2015 for the treatment of lung cancer. These drugs are checkpoint inhibitors that target checkpoints or areas that control the immune response and promote the immune response. These two drugs target the PD-1 protein, which strengthens the immune response against the cancers. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is a drug that targets PD-L1, a protein related to PD-1 that is found on some tumor cells and immune cells.</p>.<p><b>Radiofrequency ablation</b> (RFA): <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiofrequency_ablation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Radiofrequency ablation</a> is being studied as an alternative to surgery, particularly in cases of early stage lung cancer. In this type of treatment, a needle is inserted through the skin into the cancer, usually under guidance by CT scanning. Radiofrequency (electrical) energy is then transmitted to the tip of the needle where it produces heat in the tissues, killing the cancerous tissue and closing small blood vessels that supply the cancer. RFA usually is not painful and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain cancers, including lung cancers. Studies have shown that this treatment can prolong survival similarly to surgery when used to treat early stages of lung cancer but without the risks of major surgery and the prolonged recovery time associated with major surgical procedures.</p>.<p><b>Experimental therapies</b>: Since no therapy is currently available that is absolutely effective in treating lung cancer, patients may be offered a number of new therapies that are still in the experimental stage, meaning that doctors do not yet have enough information to decide whether these therapies should become accepted forms of treatment for lung cancer. New drugs or new combinations of drugs are tested in so-called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>, which are studies that evaluate the effectiveness of new medications in comparison with those treatments already in widespread use. Newer types of immunotherapy are being studied that involve the use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a>-related therapies that attempt to utilize the body's immune system to directly fight cancer cells. Lung cancer treatment <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> are being studied in clinical trials.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The prognosis of lung cancer refers to the chance for cure or prolongation of life (survival) and is dependent upon where the cancer is located, the size of the cancer, the presence of symptoms, the type of lung cancer, and the overall health status of the patient.</p>.<p>SCLC has the most aggressive growth of all lung cancers, with a median survival time of only two to four months after diagnosis when untreated. (That is, by two to four months, half of all patients have died.) However, SCLC is also the type of lung cancer most responsive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Because SCLC spreads rapidly and is usually disseminated at the time of diagnosis, methods such as surgical removal or localized radiation therapy are less effective in treating this type of lung cancer. When chemotherapy is used alone or in combination with other methods, survival time can be prolonged four- to fivefold; however, of all patients with SCLC, only 5%-10% are still alive five years after diagnosis. Most of those who survive have limited-stage SCLC before treatment.</p>.<p>In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most important prognostic factor is the stage (extent of spread) of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. Results of standard treatment are generally poor in all but the smallest of cancers that can be surgically removed. However, in stage I cancers that can be completely removed surgically, five-year survival approaches 75%. Radiation therapy can produce a cure in a small minority of patients with NSCLC and leads to relief of symptoms in most patients. In advanced-stage disease, chemotherapy offers modest improvements in survival although rates of overall survival are poor.</p>.<p>The overall prognosis for lung cancer is poor when compared with some other cancers. Survival rates for lung cancer are generally lower than those for most cancers, with an overall five-year survival rate for lung cancer of about 17% compared to 65% for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">colon cancer</a>, 91% for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">breast cancer</a>, 81% for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bladder cancer</a>, and over 99% for prostate cancer.</p>.<p>Cessation of smoking and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke is the most important measure that can prevent lung cancer. Many products, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nicotine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nicotine</a> gum, nicotine sprays, or nicotine inhalers, may be helpful to people trying to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">quit smoking</a>. Minimizing exposure to passive smoking also is an effective preventive measure. Using a home radon test kit can identify and allow correction of increased radon levels in the home. Methods that allow early detection of cancers, such as the helical low-dose CT scan, also may be of value in the identification of small cancers that can be cured by surgical resection and prevented from becoming widespread, incurable, metastatic cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
