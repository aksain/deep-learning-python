<p><b><a name="bleeding_during_pregnancy_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="is_bleeding_during_pregnancy_normal" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vaginal bleeding during the first three months of pregnancy is relatively common and usually is a cause of concern for the mother. Women wonder how much bleeding during early pregnancy is normal. While early bleeding may indicate the presence of a serious problem, this is frequently not the case. In fact, approximately 20% of pregnant women experience light bleeding or spotting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Most women go on to have uncomplicated pregnancies and ultimately deliver a healthy baby.</p>.<p><strong>Spotting:</strong> Spotting usually refers to a few drops of blood that would not cover a pad or panty liner. Bleeding refers to blood flow that is heavy enough to require wearing a pad. If bleeding occurs during the first trimester, a panty liner or pad should be worn so that you are able to get an idea of the amount of bleeding that is occurring and can tell the health-care professional. However, you should not use a tampon in the vagina during pregnancy or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">douche</a>.</p>.<p><strong>Changes in the cervix: </strong>The normal hormone production during pregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, rendering it softer and more prone to bleeding. Also, a cervical polyp (a benign overgrowth of tissue) may form, and this may bleed more easily during pregnancy. In both cases, spotting or light bleeding may be provoked following sexual intercourse or a pelvic examination.</p>.<p><strong>Infection:</strong> A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trichomoniasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vaginal infection</a> may cause spontaneous vaginal bleeding. The bleeding may be accompanied by an abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vaginal discharge</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_implantation_bleeding_during_the_first_trimester_what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A common benign cause of bleeding may occur even before a woman realizes that she is pregnant. Many women bleed when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. This is called <b>implantation bleeding</b>. It frequently occurs when the next menstrual period is expected. Signs of implantation bleeding are light bleeding or spotting around the time of the expected menstrual period. This does not happen in every pregnancy.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_other_common_causes_of_bleeding_during_the_first_trimester_of_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_serious_causes_heaving_bleeding_during_the_first_trimester_of_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy may sometimes indicate a serious problem.

Sometimes, having sex or even having an internal (pelvic) examination by your OB/GYN or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doula_vs_midwife/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Midwife</a> can cause light bleeding. Problems with the cervix, including cervical insufficiency (when the cervix opens too early in pregnancy) or infection of the cervix, can lead to bleeding.
