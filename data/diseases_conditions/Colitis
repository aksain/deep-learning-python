<p>Colitis describes inflammation of the inner lining of the colon and can be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bloating</a>, and blood in the stool. This inflammation may be due to a variety of reasons, including the following:</p>.<p>The colon, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">large intestine</a>, is a hollow, muscular tube that processes waste products of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">digestion</a> from the small intestine, removes water, and ultimately eliminates the remnants as feces (stool) through the anus. The colon is located within the peritoneum, the sac that contains the intestine, located in the abdominal cavity.</p>.<p>The colon is surrounded by many layers of tissue. The innermost layer of the colon is the mucosa that comes into contact with the waste products of digestion. The mucosa absorbs water and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrolytes</a> back into the blood vessels that are located just below the surface in the submucosa. This is surrounded by a circular layer of muscles and then another outer layer of longitudinal muscles that run along the length of the colon. The muscles work together to rhythmically squeeze liquid waste from the cecum through the entire length of the colon. Water is gradually removed, turning the waste into formed stool, so that it is excreted out of the anus in solid form.</p>.<p>The colon frames the organs within the peritoneum, and its segments are named based on their location.</p>.<p>Colitis describes inflammation of the colon (col=colon + itis=inflammation). Examples of causes of colitis include</p>.<p>Many bacteria reside in the colon; they live in harmony with the body and cause no symptoms. However, some infections can result if a virus, bacteria, or parasite invade the small and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">large intestine</a>.</p>.<p>Common bacteria that cause colitis include</p>.<p>These infections usually occur because the patient has eaten contaminated food. Symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> with or without blood, abdominal cramps, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a> from water loss because of numerous watery, bowel movements. Other organs can also be affected by the infection or the toxins that the bacteria can produce.</p>.<p><i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clostridium_difficile_colitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Clostridium difficile</a></i>, commonly referred to as <i>C. diff</i>, is a bacterial cause of colitis that often occurs after a person has been prescribed an antibiotic or has been hospitalized. <i>C. diff</i> is found in the colon of healthy people and coexists with other "normal" bacteria. But when antibiotics are prescribed, susceptible bacteria in the colon can be destroyed, allowing the clostridia to grow unchecked, causing colitis. Patchy membranes form over the colon mucosa and some health-care professionals refer to <i>C. diff</i> colitis as pseudomembranous colitis. The bacteria also may be found on many surfaces in the hospital (for example, bedrails, toilets, and stethoscopes), and the infection may spread from person to person (it is highly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contagious</a>). Unfortunately, this infection is becoming more common outside the hospital environment, and people can develop community acquired <i>C. diff</i> colitis without exposure to antibiotics or a medical facility.</p>.<p>Worldwide, the most common parasite infection to cause colitis is <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>. It is acquired by drinking infected water and can also be passed from person to person because of poor sanitation and hygiene. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The colon can be thought of as a hollow muscle. It requires a normal blood supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients for the muscle to function normally. When the colon loses its supply of blood and becomes ischemic (isch= restricted + emia=blood supply), it may become inflamed. Ischemia or lack of blood supply causes inflammation of the colon leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> (bowel movements may contain blood).</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Ulcerative colitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Crohn's disease</a> are the two types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_ibd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">inflammatory bowel disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_ibd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">IBD</a>) that cause colitis. They are considered autoimmune diseases (the body's immune system "attacks" itself).</p>.<p>Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may have other organ systems involved in addition to the gastrointestinal tract.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are two types of microscopic colitis: 1) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lymphocytic_colitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">collagenous colitis</a> and 2) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lymphocytic_colitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymphocytic colitis</a>. Either collagen or lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) infiltrate into the layers of the wall of the colon, presumably as a result of inflammation. This is an uncommon illness and may be an autoimmune disease. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> often is watery, and no blood is present in the stool.</p>.<p>In infants younger than 1 year of age, colitis is often due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a> to cow or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/soy_glycine_soya-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">soy</a> milk. Allergic colitis may be seen in breastfed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a>, where mothers drink cow's milk and pass that protein into their breast milk. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Inflammation of the colon causes the muscle layers to go into intermittent spasm, causing colicky or cramp-like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pain</a> that comes and goes. The pain usually is in the lower abdomen but can be felt anywhere along the course of the colon. Since the muscles fail to contract in a normal pattern and the colonic contents move through the colon rapidly, there is little opportunity for water to be reabsorbed. This leads to watery <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">diarrhea</a>. If the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and breaks down, bleeding may occur. In <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">ulcerative colitis</a>, small ulcers form and are the cause of bleeding.</p>.<p>With colitis, particularly colitis involving the distal colon (rectum and sigmoid colon), the pain often crescendos and precedes a diarrheal bowel movement. After the bowel movement, the pain may subside but then returns with the next episode of diarrhea. The person also may have a feeling of urgency to have a bowel movement.</p>.<p>Depending upon the cause of the colitis, other organ systems in the body may be involved and produce symptoms such as</p>.<p>Both <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">ulcerative colitis</a> and Crohn's diseases may have associated symptoms outside of the colon due to the body itself attacking other organs. These may include</p>.<p>Diarrhea is a common sign of colitis. It is usually self-limited and resolves on its own with supportive care, including rest and a short course of a clear-fluid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>. <i>However, seek medical care if the diarrhea persists for more than two to three weeks, if there is blood in the stool, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, or the person has signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a>.</i></p>.<p>Most often colitis is treated by a primary-care provider or internal-medicine specialist, especially when the colitis is first diagnosed and the cause is uncertain. Once the cause is found, that provider may be the only person needed to continue care. Should there be a need for further investigation and diagnostic testing, specialists may be consulted, such as a gastroenterologist. If an infection is the cause of colitis, an infectious-disease specialist may be consulted. In some cases, other specialists may be involved in treatment, such as surgeons and interventional radiologists.</p>.<p>Once the history is taken, physical examination will be helpful in determining the potential causes of the symptoms.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Colonoscopy</a>: The length of the colon can be directly viewed by colonoscopy. A gastroenterologist uses a thin, flexible tube equipped with a fiberoptic camera to view the inside lining of the colon. The appearance of the colonic lining often allows the doctor to make the diagnosis and also provides the opportunity to look for tumors and polyps. Biopsies (small bits of tissue) can be obtained from the mucosal lining during colonoscopy and evaluated under the microscope by a pathologist to determine the cause of colitis. Biopsy is the only way to diagnose microscopic colitis.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Computerized tomography</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barium_enema/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">barium enema</a> are tests that are sometimes ordered to help diagnose the potential cause of colitis. CT scan of the abdomen has become a more common test to evaluate patients with abdominal pain. However, it is important for the health-care professional to balance the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> with the reward of the information that can be obtained. These tests usually are performed by a radiologist. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The treatment of colitis depends upon the cause.</p>.<p>For undiagnosed or uncontrolled colitis, the initial therapy (regardless of the cause) is to stabilize the patient's vital signs and help control pain if needed. Rehydration may be accomplished by mouth. However, for those patients who are markedly dry, who are unable to tolerate fluids by mouth, or have electrolyte abnormalities, intravenous fluids may be required.</p>.<p>Medications are often used to control inflammatory bowel disease and the choice of medication is tailored to the individual patient.</p>.<p>Antibiotics are not commonly used unless a specific bacteria is isolated and treatment is known to shorten the course of the infection.</p>.<p>Over-the-counter medications to treat diarrhea should be used with caution, especially if abdominal pain and fever are present. It is always wise to check with a care provider or pharmacist prior to taking antidiarrheal medications.</p>.<p>Surgery is usually not a treatment option for most causes of colitis.</p>.<p>Colitis often is associated with diarrhea, and the body can lose significant amounts of fluid with each episode of diarrhea. Moreover, the colon is inflamed, and it is important to try to "rest" it. Since clear fluids tend to be absorbed mostly in the stomach and small intestine, initially avoiding solid foods and promoting a clear fluid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> may be of help in rehydrating the body and resting the colon.</p>.<p>Changing your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> to reduce symptoms or flares may help soothe the symptoms of the disease, but there is no cure for some forms of colitis.</p>.<p>Depending on the cause, some people with colitis may find that certain foods bring on or make their symptoms worse. Keeping a food diary may be helpful and then avoid foods that may be associated with worsening symptoms.</p>.<p>The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America recommends avoiding the following foods if you have colitis:</p>.<p>People who are lactose intolerant should avoid dairy products containing lactose. There are a variety of companies (for example, Lactaid and Green Valley Organics) that offer lactose-free products such as milk, yogurt, ice cream, and cottage cheese.</p>.<p>Patients with infectious diarrhea tend to get better relatively quickly with supportive care. Most infections will resolve with or without specific treatment and often do not require antibiotics. Those decisions depend on the patient's diagnosis.</p>.<p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease probably will require lifelong treatment to help control their symptoms. The goal, as with any long-term illness, is to allow the patient to live a normal life with minimal symptoms from the disease.</p>.<p>Patients with ischemic colitis need to minimize their risk factors for progressive narrowing of the arteries. These are the same risks as for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">heart disease</a> and require the same treatment approach, including controlling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_hyperlipidemia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high cholesterol</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">smoking</a> cessation. Patients with severe ischemia that leads to a dead (gangrenous) colon require surgery to remove the gangrenous segment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
