<p><b><a name="frozen_shoulder_adhesive_capsulitis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A frozen shoulder is a shoulder joint with significant loss of its range of motion in all directions. The range of motion is limited not only when the patient attempts motion but also when the doctor attempts to move the joint fully while the patient relaxes. A frozen shoulder is medically referred to as adhesive capsulitis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Frozen shoulder is the result of inflammation, scarring, thickening, and shrinkage of the capsule that surrounds the normal shoulder joint. Any shoulder injury can lead to a frozen shoulder, including tendinitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bursitis</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rotator_cuff/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rotator cuff injury</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rotator_cuff/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rotator cuff</a> syndrome). Adhesive capsulitis occurs more frequently in patients with risk factors of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, chronic inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a> of the shoulder, or after chest or breast surgery. Long-term immobility of the shoulder joint can put people at risk to develop a frozen shoulder.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms and signs of a frozen shoulder include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shoulder_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shoulder pain</a>, stiffness, and loss of range of shoulder motion. The shoulder range of motion is limited when either the patient or an examiner attempts to move the joint. The shoulder can develop increased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> with use. These symptoms can make <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> very uncomfortable.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A frozen shoulder is suggested during examination when the shoulder range of motion is significantly limited, with either the patient or the examiner attempting the movement. Underlying diseases involving the shoulder can be diagnosed with the history, examination, blood testing, and X-ray examination of the shoulder.</p>.<p>If necessary, the diagnosis can be confirmed when an X-ray contrast dye is injected into the shoulder joint to demonstrate the characteristic shrunken shoulder capsule of a frozen shoulder. This X-ray test is called arthrography. The tissues of the shoulder can also be evaluated with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> scan.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_can_mimic_adhesive_capsulitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Inflammation of the shoulder joint (arthritis) or the muscles around the shoulder and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">degenerative arthritis</a> of the shoulder joint can cause swelling, pain, or stiffness of the joint that can mimic the range of motion limitation of a frozen shoulder.</p>.<p>Injury to individual tendons around the shoulder (tendons of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rotator_cuff_injury_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">rotator cuff</a>) can limit shoulder-joint range of motion but usually not in all directions. Often during the examination of a shoulder with tendon injury (tendinitis or tendon tear), the doctor is able to move the joint with the patient relaxed beyond the range that the patient can on their own.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of a frozen shoulder usually requires an aggressive combination of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cortisone_injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">cortisone injection</a>(s) into the shoulder, and physical therapy (physiotherapy). Without aggressive treatment, adhesive capsulitis can be permanent.</p>.<p>Diligent physical therapy is often essential for recovery. A physical therapist will administer <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>, electric stimulation, range-of-motion <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> maneuvers, stretching, ice packs, and eventually strengthening exercises. Physical therapy can take weeks to months for recovery, depending on the severity of the scarring of the tissues around the shoulder.</p>.<p>It is very important for people with a frozen shoulder to avoid reinjuring the shoulder tissues during the rehabilitation period. These individuals should avoid sudden, jerking motions of or heavy lifting with the affected shoulder.</p>.<p>Sometimes a frozen shoulders is resistant to treatment. Patients with resistant frozen shoulders can be considered for release of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar tissue</a> by arthroscopic surgery or manipulation of the scarred shoulder under anesthesia. This manipulation is performed to physically break up the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar</a> tissue of the joint capsule. It carries the risk of breaking the arm bone (humerus <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fracture</a>). It is very important for patients that undergo manipulation to partake in an active <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> program for the shoulder after the procedure. It is only with continued exercise of the shoulder that mobility and function is optimized.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of a frozen shoulder depends on its response to physical therapy, exercises, and treatments as described above. Again, it is essential to avoid reinjuring the shoulder tissues during the rehabilitation period. Patients with resistant frozen shoulders can be considered for release of the scar tissue by arthroscopic surgery or manipulation of the scarred shoulder under anesthesia. Without aggressive treatment, a frozen shoulder can be permanent.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_a_frozen_shoulder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prevention of a frozen shoulder involves avoiding injury or reinjury to the shoulder.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
