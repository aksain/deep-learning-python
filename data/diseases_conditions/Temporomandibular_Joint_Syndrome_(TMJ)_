<p>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome is a disorder of the jaw muscles and nerves caused by injury or inflammation to the temporomandibular joint. The temporomandibular joint is the connection between the jawbone and the skull. The injured or inflamed temporomandibular joint leads to pain with chewing, clicking, crackling, and popping of the jaw; swelling on the sides of the face; nerve inflammation; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headaches</a>, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">migraines</a>; tooth grinding (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teeth_grinding_bruxism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruxism</a>); Eustachian tube dysfunction; and sometimes dislocation of the temporomandibular joint. Temporomandibular joint syndrome is also known as temporomandibular joint disorder.</p>.<p>There are several risk factors for TMJ syndrome:</p>.<p>The causes of TMJ syndrome are not completely understood. Multiple factors contribute to the muscle tightness and dysfunction that characterize this condition. It is not clear whether some of these causes directly lead to TMJ syndrome or if they are a result of the disorder. Causes may include</p>.<p>The main symptom of TMJ syndrome is pain in the jaw joint. This joint is located just in front of the ear, and pain associated with TMJ syndrome may involve the face, eye, forehead, ear, or neck. Signs and symptoms of TMJ syndrome include the following:</p>.<p>A doctor will diagnose TMJ syndrome by taking the patient's medical history and doing a physical exam to find the cause of the symptoms. There is no specific test to diagnose TMJ syndrome. A doctor may send the patient to an oral and maxillofacial specialist, an otolaryngologist (also called an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT specialist), or a dentist specializing in jaw disorders to confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> of the temporomandibular joint may be ordered to detect damage to the cartilage of the jaw joint and to rule out other medical problems.</p>.<p>A condition that may have some similar symptoms to TMJ syndrome is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trigeminal_neuralgia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">trigeminal neuralgia</a>. The trigeminal nerve supplies nerve impulses to the temporomandibular joint, and when irritated, it can also cause facial pain. Other causes of face or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neck_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">neck pain</a> include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">swollen lymph nodes</a> (swollen glands), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polymyalgia_rheumatica/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">giant cell arteritis</a>, salivary gland disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sore throat</a>, ill-fitting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dentures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dentures</a>, or dental <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/orthodontics_braces_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">braces</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Many symptoms of TMJ syndrome can respond well to home remedies or stress reduction and relaxation techniques. The following home remedies may provide some relief:</p>.<p>When home remedies are not effective, medical treatment options may be necessary. Most of these types of treatments and remedies will not cure TMJ, but they can provide temporary and even long-term relief from the pain symptoms. These include the following:</p>.<p>You may first be diagnosed with TMJ by your primary care provider (PCP), such as a family practitioner, internist, or a child's pediatrician. Your doctor may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial specialist, an otolaryngologist (also called an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT specialist), or a dentist specializing in jaw disorders (prosthodontist, also called a prosthetic dentist) for further treatment. You may also see a pain-management specialist if your TMJ pain is severe.</p>.<p>The prognosis for TMJ syndrome is generally good. There are numerous causes for TMJ syndrome, so the outlook depends on the cause, if known. Most people can manage the discomfort with self-care and home remedies.</p>.<p>Complications of long-term TMJ syndrome include chronic face pain or chronic headaches. In severe situations, where pain is chronic, or associated with other inflammatory disorders, long-term treatment may be necessary.</p>.<p>Symptoms of TMJ syndrome tend to be episodic and related to stress and lifestyle.</p>.<p>Prevention of TMJ syndrome symptoms can often be achieved using self-care at home, such as</p>
