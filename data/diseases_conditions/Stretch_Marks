<p><b><a name="stretch_mark_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stretch marks appear as linear streaks on the skin that has been overstretched, and they run perpendicular to maximum lines of tension in the skin. They begin as flat red lines, and over time they appear as slightly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depressed</a> white streaks. They tend to occur near the armpits, on the thighs, abdomen, chest, and groin. Their appearance is similar to changes seen in the surface of rubber balloons that have been overinflated.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is some controversy over the precise
mechanism by which striae occur. There seems to be damage to the elastic fibers
of the dermis (the deeper layer of the skin) accompanied by inflammation which
eventually results in scar-like changes. These changes appear to be induced by
excessive physical stretching of the skin. There are a number of clinical
situations which will predispose the skin to the formation of striae. These
include rapid and excessive increase in body mass, the excessive use of topical
or systemic glucocorticoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> (steroids), Cushing's disease (overproduction
of glucocorticoids by the adrenal gland), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">puberty</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/marfan_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Marfan's syndrome</a> and Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (two uncommon genetic diseases), excessively large <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_augmentation/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast implants</a>, and
pregnancy. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Excessive rapid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight gain</a> and
pregnancy are the two most common risk factors. Other risk factors include the
conditions described above that predispose the skin to developing stretch marks.
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Striae are rarely painful or
itchy. They do not produce troublesome symptoms. They begin as linear red
streaks and eventually mature into linear white lines. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_stretch_marks_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since stretch marks are quite common, most
people are familiar with their appearance. They are identifiable on visual
inspection by patients and doctors. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a wide variety of
treatments, but none of them seem to be particularly valuable in preventing or
treating this condition. It is generally agreed that there is no good medical
evidence that any creams or ointments will produce any sustained improvement in
the appearance of stretch marks. The use of physical modalities such as lasers
and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a> holds some promise, but time will tell if these treatments are
effective. </p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_any_home_remedies_for_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No, there is no evidence that
any home remedies can improve the appearance of stretch marks. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_stretch_marks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As the striae mature, they become
less apparent but they rarely disappear. They do not cause any health problems.
