<p>Birth control works to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> in different ways.</p>.<p>There is no form of birth control that is 100% effective, so it is possible to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">get pregnant</a> while using most types of birth control. However, many types of birth control, when used correctly, are highly effective in preventing pregnancy. For example, the birth control pill is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy when taken correctly. For all forms of birth control it is important to have a basic understanding how they work and how to use them correctly. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Types of birth control methods include options that prevent sperm from reaching an egg, known as barrier methods; methods that prevent ovulation, and methods that prevent implantation of a fertilized egg into the uterus. Permanent methods (surgical sterilization) are also available for those who no longer desire to have children.</p>.<p>Types of birth control include:</p>.<p>Hormonal birth control methods include:</p>.<p>Barrier birth control methods include:</p>.<p>Natural birth control methods include:</p>.<p>Surgical sterilization methods include:</p>.<p>Hormonal options of birth control involve the use of hormones to prevent ovulation in a woman. Although oral contraceptive pills are the most widely used hormonal method, other options are available including the vaginal ring, hormone patches applied to the skin, and injections of progestin.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Heart attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strokes</a> are potential and serious complications of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">oral contraceptives</a>.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cigarette smoking</a> increases the risk of these complications. This risk is greatest in women over 35 who are heavy smokers (&gt;15 cigarettes/day). Your health-care professional l usually will recommend that you <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">quit smoking</a> if you use birth control pills.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Barrier options prevent fertilization of the egg by a sperm cell. These either prevent contact between egg and sperm via a physical block or kill sperm cells before they are able to fertilize an egg. Examples of physical barrier contraceptives include the diaphragm, condoms, and the cervical cap or shield.</p>.<p>Contraceptive sponges contain a spermicide cream to kill sperm cells, and other forms of spermicides are available as well. Spermicides may be used in combination with barrier methods for greater effectiveness.</p>.<p>Side effects of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barrier_methods_of_birth_control/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">barrier methods of birth control</a> can include:</p>.<p>One of the advantages to the use of barrier methods is that they can decrease the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sexually transmitted diseases</a> (especially properly used condoms). None of them eliminate this risk.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Surgical sterilization is a form of permanent birth control that is available for both women (tubal ligation) and men (vasectomy). Sterilization implants (a small coil is inserted into the fallopian tubes to block them) are a more recent type of permanent birth control that is available for women that allows women to avoid the surgical procedure associated with tubal ligation.</p>.<p>Although women who have had tubal ligation do not have side effects after recovering from the procedure, any surgery itself carries a small risk of infection or bleeding as well as complications from the anesthetic agents.</p>.<p>Likewise, the vasectomy procedure is associated with small risks from the procedure as well as some swelling and pain in the days following the procedure. For a time period post vasectomy a man can still be fertile and it is usually recommended that a barrier method or other birth control method is used for 10-12 weeks or 15 to 20 ejaculations post procedure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Natural methods involve tracking a woman's menstrual cycle to try to determine when ovulation is most likely to occur, and avoiding sexual intercourse (or using barrier contraceptives) during that time. There are different ways to detect ovulation, including the basal body temperature method ( ovulation causes a slight increase in basal body temperature )and the use of home ovulation test kits. Checking and recording the consistency of cervical mucus is another way to help determine when ovulation occurs.</p>.<p>These methods tend to be the least successful methods as they require discipline in recording and tracking and understanding of the results.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Emergency contraception is a medication or device used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse has occurred. Emergency hormonal contraceptives are sometimes known as "morning after" pills. These drugs prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after intercourse. This is also known as emergency contraception. Insertion of a copper intrauterine device (IUD) is also an effective method of emergency contraception.</p>.<p>Side effects of emergency contraception or "morning after" pills can include</p>.<p>IUDs or intrauterine devices are implantable devices that create an environment in the lining tissues of the womb that is unfavorable for implantation of a fertilized egg.</p>.<p>Side effects of IUDs depend on the type of IUD being used.</p>
