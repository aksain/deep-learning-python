increasing doses. When starting immunotherapy, you will need to go to your 
healthcare provider once or twice a week for several months. The dose is 
increased each time until the maintenance dose is reached. If the shots are 
effective, you will go to your healthcare provider every 2 to 4 weeks for 2 to 5 
more years. You may become less sensitive to allergens during this time, and 
your allergy symptoms will become milder and may even go away completely. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_should_i_prepare_for_allergy_shots" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For two hours before and after your appointment, do not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> or engage in
