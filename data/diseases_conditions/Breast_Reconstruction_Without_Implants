<p><b><a name="tissue" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While tissue from the back or buttocks may be used, the most common flap procedure uses muscle and skin taken from the abdomen. Using either the tunneling or free-flap technique, muscle, skin and fat are transplanted from the abdomen to the chest area. After the flap of tissue has been transferred, the surgeon shapes it into the contour of a breast.</p>.<p>When the abdominal flap is not an option, the surgeon may use tissue from the back -- and, less often, the buttocks -- in making the new breast.</p>.<p><b><a name="benefits" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Using one's own tissue and muscle results in a more natural looking breast that is not vulnerable to the problems that sometimes occur with implants. The shape, feel and contour of a breast reconstructed from a woman's own tissue more closely resemble the characteristics of a natural breast.</p>.<p>Transferring tissue from the abdomen also results in tightening of the stomach resembling a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tummy_tuck__abdominoplasty/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tummy tuck</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="challenges" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Flap surgery is more involved than implant surgery. And, like all major surgical procedures, it carries the risk of complications, such as bleeding, infection or poor healing. However, these complications, should they occur, can be treated at the hospital.</p>.<p>Flap procedures also leave additional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scars</a> on the abdomen, back or buttocks and require a longer hospital stay than implant surgery; on average five to six days versus one or two days for implant recipients. Generally, the additional scars resulting from the flap procedure are well concealed. </p>.<p><b><a name="care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most women return to normal activities within six weeks after surgery. It may be several weeks before you can do strenuous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a>. After you go home, you can expect some soreness, swelling and bruising for two to three weeks. You may be asked to apply medications to the suture area or change bandages at home. Your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> surgeon will advise you about showering, bathing and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid_pictures_slideshow_wound_care_true_false/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wound care</a>.</p>.<p>Mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery will leave areas of numbness where the surgery was performed. Instead of feeling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> where the tissue was taken, a patient may feel numbness and tightness. The same is true of the reconstruction site. In time, some feeling may return in your breasts. Most scars will fade over time.</p>.<p>The shape of your reconstructed breast will gradually improve over the months following the reconstruction.</p>.<p>You'll be asked to return for regular checkups at first. If you have a temporary expander implanted, it will be expanded with saline on average once a week until the desired size is obtained (usually within six to ten office visits).</p>.<p>After breast reconstruction, you should continue to examine your breasts every month. You should continue to have regular screening examinations, such as an annual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mammogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mammogram</a>.</p>.<p>Breast reconstruction has no bearing on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> recurrence or surveillance, and generally does not interfere with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a> or

A recurrence can still be treated by any of the standard treatment methods, which include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

Reconstructing the breast is not considered a cosmetic procedure.
