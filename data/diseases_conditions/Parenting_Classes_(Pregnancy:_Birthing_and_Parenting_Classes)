Some classes follow a specific method, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childbirth_class_options/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lamaze</a> or the Bradley method.

Breastfeeding classes offer pregnant women and their partners the chance to prepare and ask questions before the baby's arrival. Classes may be offered through hospitals, breastfeeding support programs, La Leche League, or local lactation consultants. Ask your doctor for help finding a breastfeeding class in your area.</p>.<p><b><a name="parenting_classes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many first-time parents have never cared for a newborn. Hospitals, community education centers, and places of worship sometimes offer baby care classes. These classes cover the basics, such as diapering, feeding, and bathing your newborn. 
The American Red Cross offers such courses as "Family <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">First Aid</a>" and "CPR Online 
- Pediatric."</p>.<p>You also will learn these basic skills in the hospital before you are discharged.</p>.<p>In some communities parenting classes are available. Children don't come with how-to manuals. So some parents appreciate learning about the different stages of child development, as well as practical skills for dealing with common issues, such as discipline or parent-child power struggles. Counselors and social workers often teach this type of class. If you are interested in parenting programs, ask your child's doctor for help finding a class in your area.</p>.<p><b>Did you know?</b> Some hospitals and birthing centers offer sibling classes for soon-to-be brothers and sisters.
