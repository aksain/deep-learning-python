<p><b><a name="what_is_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Physiologically, sleep is a complex process of restoration and renewal for the body. Scientists still do not have a definitive explanation for why humans have a need for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. We do know that sleep is not a passive process or "switching off" of body functions; sleep is believed to be important in many physiologic processes including the processing of experiences and the consolidation of memories. It is also clear that sleep is essential, not only for humans but for almost all animals. </p>.<p>The importance of sleep is underscored by the symptoms experienced by those suffering from sleep problems. People suffering from sleep disorders do not get adequate or restorative sleep, and sleep deprivation is associated with a number of both physical and emotional disturbances.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_the_body_to_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleep is influenced by the circadian rhythms (regular body changes in mental and physical characteristics that occur in the course of about 24 hours). These are controlled by brain neurons that respond to light, temperature and hormones and other signals and comprise the body's biological clock. This clock helps regulate the "normal" awake and sleep cycles. Disruption of these cycles can make people sleepy, 
or somnolent, at times people want to be awake. For example, travelers experience "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jet_lag/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">jet lag</a>" when they cross time zones. When a New Yorker arrives in Paris at midnight Paris time, his or her body continues to operate (their biological clock) on New York time. It may take several days to reset a person's biologic clock, depending on how much it has been altered by the time change. 
Different organ systems in the body recover at different rates.</p>.<p>There is evidence that some aspects of sleep are under genetic influence; a gene termed DEC2 is being investigated as causing people that possess it to require only about 6 hours of sleep. Researchers have only begun to examine the genetics involved in sleep.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_stages_of_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two general states of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is further subdivided (see below).</p>.<p>Disruptions in the entire sleep cycle or in the individual phases are believed to account for the various types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep disorders</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_it_take_to_get_rem_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleep typically occurs in cycles that range from 90 to 120 minutes in length, with 4 to 5 cycles occurring during each night's sleep. In the first half of the night, there is a transition from wakefulness into stage N1 sleep, then to stages N2, and N3. Stages N2 and N3 then reappear, followed by the first instance of REM sleep. Cycles of stage N2 and REM sleep alternate with each other for the second half of the night. Typically, there is a greater portion of N sleep in the first half of the night and REM sleep in the later portion of the night.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_rem_sleep_important" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>REM sleep makes up less than 25% of total sleep time, and the reason for its importance is not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that REM sleep is necessary for the brain to preserve memories and maintain appropriate neurological connections.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_percentage_of_sleep_should_be_deep_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Deep (N3) sleep, as defined above, only accounts for about 20% of total sleep. The largest amount of deep sleep takes place in the first half of the night.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_much_sleep_does_a_person_need" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Individuals vary greatly in their need for sleep; there are no established criteria to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs. Eight hours or more may be necessary for some people, while others may consider this to be too much sleep.</p>.<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that most average adults need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Newborn</a> babies, by contrast, sleep from 16 to 18 hours a day. Preschool-aged children typically sleep between 10 and 12 hours a day. Older, school-aged children and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teens</a> need at least 9 hours of sleep a night. Women in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">first trimester</a> of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> have been observed to need a few more hours' sleep than is usual for them.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_the_amount_of_sleep_we_need_change_as_we_age" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Changes in the sleep cycle do occur with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a>. Deep or slow wave sleep (Stage N3) sleep declines as we age, while light sleep (Stage N1) increases with age, so that older adults may spend less time in the more restorative stages of sleep and more time in lighter sleep. Older people are also more easily aroused from sleep. While some people believe that older adults need less sleep as they get older, there is no scientific evidence that older people need less sleep than younger adults.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_signs_and_symptoms_of_sleep_deprivation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Feeling tired or drowsy at any time during the day is one symptom of not having enough sleep. Being able to fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down in the evening also may be a sign a person may be suffering from sleep deprivation. People who suffer from sleep deprivation often experience so-called "microsleeps," which are short bursts of sleep in an otherwise awake person.</p>.<p>Sleep-deprived people perform poorly on tests such as driving simulators and tests of hand-eye coordination. Sleep deprivation can also magnify the effects of alcohol, meaning that a sleep-deprived person will be more susceptible to becoming impaired after alcohol consumption than a well-rested person. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Caffeine</a> and other stimulants cannot successfully overcome the drowsiness associated with sleep deprivation.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_and_what_causes_sleep_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleep disorders are disruptions of the sleep cycle or the quality of sleep. About 50 to 70 million Americans are believed to suffer from chronic sleep disorders, with millions more affected on an occasional basis. Doctors have defined over 70 different types of sleep disorders, but the most common sleep disorders are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insomnia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep apnea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/restless_leg_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">restless legs syndrome</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/narcolepsy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">narcolepsy</a>.</p>.<p>Other sleep disorders include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_sleep_problems_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors use a number of different tests to evaluate sleep and determine whether a sleep disorder is present. A careful medical history and physical examination are performed to help identify any medical conditions that may be interfering with the person's sleep. The health care practitioner will also ask about the use of prescription and non-prescription medications as well as alcohol, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tobacco</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a> use. Laboratory tests may also be used to help diagnose any medical conditions that may cause sleep problems.</p>.<p>In some cases, specialized testing is recommended to help determine whether or not a person may be suffering from a sleep disorder. Some of the most common sleep tests include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_sleep_problems_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of sleep disorders depends upon the exact disorder and the degree of severity of the symptoms. Both medical and non-medical approaches are generally used in the treatment of sleep disorders. In some cases, such as sleep apnea, surgical treatments may be considered. 
In some patients, more than one type of sleep disorder may be present, requiring 
a combination of treatment considerations.</p>.<p><b><a name="sleep_hygiene" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Non-medical treatment options are often referred to as sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene is the practice of behavioral habits that offer the maximum potential for restorative and sound sleep. Good sleep hygiene practices include:</p>.<p><b><a name="other_therapies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Of course, many people with sleep disorders will require treatment beyond sleep hygiene measures. <b>Behavioral therapies</b> are successful for many people who suffer from insomnia. These therapies may consist of stimulus control measures, such as using the bed for sleeping and sex only and not for other activities such as reading or TV watching. <b>Sleep restriction therapies</b> are often used to help individuals avoid staying in bed too long and actually over-sleeping after a night of insomnia.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="sleep_aids_prescription_and_otc" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Medications</b> can be of value in treating some types of sleep disorders. However, since sedating medications typically have the potential for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">addiction</a> and abuse, their use must be carefully supervised by a health care practitioner. Among the types of prescription <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> that have been prescribed for specific sleep disorders include:</p>.<p><b>OTC sleep medications</b> are sometimes used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. These include the sedating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antihistamines</a> such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diphenhydramine</a> (Benadryl). However, this is not a recommended use of these or other similar drugs due to their many side effects and the possibility of long-term drowsiness the following day.</p>.<p><b>Melatonin</b>, a chemical released from the brain which induces sleep, has been tried in supplement form and promoted as a natural sleep remedy for treatment of insomnia. But studies have shown that it has been generally ineffective in treating common types of insomnia, except in specific situations in patients with known low levels of melatonin.</p>.<p><b>CPAP devices</b> (continuous positive airway pressure; a device worn over the face that holds the airway open by maintaining constant air pressure) or AutoPAP (PAP delivered over a range of pressures) and <b>dental appliances</b> have been effective in the management of sleep-related breathing disorders, including sleep apnea. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CPAP</a> is typically the first line of therapy for most adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Surgery can be effective for some patients and may help patients respond to CPAP. Newer, implantable devices that stimulate the muscles of the upper airway during sleep may also be a treatment option for some patients.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_sleep_problems_and_disease_related" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleep problems occur in a number of different medical and psychiatric conditions. For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">asthma</a> attacks and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> are conditions that tend to occur frequently during the night or early morning hours. The relationship between sleep stages and certain types of epileptic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a> is complex and not completely understood, but certain sleep stages tend to either exacerbate or prevent the spread of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizure</a> activity in the brain. </p>.<p>Sleep problems occur with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chronic pain</a> and conditions in which <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> is worse at night, because the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> may interfere with sleep. Pain medications and other types of medications taken on a regular basis for chronic conditions can also have an effect on an individual's sleep pattern. Those suffering from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain injury</a> are also commonly affected by sleep disturbances.</p>.<p>Psychiatric diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> are also associated with sleep problems. This condition can be associated with both too much sleep and too little sleep. In fact, sleep problems are associated with a majority of mental disorders, and poor quality or insufficient sleep can worsen the symptoms of mental or psychiatric conditions.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_get_a_good_nights_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Practicing good sleep hygiene (see above), including maintenance of a regular bedtime and awakening schedule, is the best way to ensure restful and restorative sleep. Avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and strenuous exercise in the hours prior to bedtime can also help improve the quality of your sleep. Many people report that they lie awake at night worrying about problems or situations they will face during the coming day. In this case, it can be helpful to write a to-do list or a list of items to act upon the following day prior to bedtime, giving yourself permission to "let go" of these items during the night. </p>.<p>If you are concerned about the quality of your sleep or if you have the symptoms of a sleep disorder, it is important to consult your health care practitioner.
