<p><b><a name="how_common_is_this_foreign_body_in_the_ear_problem_and_is_it_serious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Foreign objects in the ear are common reasons for emergency room visits, especially in children.</p>.<p>If a you aren't sure of the potential for harm of the foreign body, seek medical care immediately.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_objects_get_stuck_in_the_ear_causes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most objects that get stuck in the ear canal are placed there by the person themselves. Children who are curious about their bodies and interesting objects, are the group most often has this problem (children aged 9 months to 8 years).</p>.<p>The most common things they put in their ears include:</p>.<p><b>Ear wax:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_wax/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Ear wax</a> is a naturally occurring substance in the ear canal but can become a problem when it builds up to the point that it clogs the ear canal, and causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing loss</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>. Overuse of cotton swabs such as Q-tips to clean the ear can actually push wax and skin cell debris further into the canal and pack it against the eardrum causing symptoms.</p>.<p><b>Insects:</b> Insects can also fly or crawl into the ear canal. Usually this happens while sleeping on the floor or outdoors (for example, camping). This is often a frightening and dramatic event as the insect's buzzing and movement is very loud and sometimes painful.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_of_a_foreign_body_in_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Pain, inflammation, and irritation: </b>The skin in the ear canal and the eardrum is very sensitive. Any inflammation or injury is usually readily apparent due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> or irritation.</p>.<p><b>In young children:</b> The diagnosis can be challenging in young children who are not old enough to verbalize their pain. Redness, swelling, or discharge (blood, inflammatory fluid, or pus) are the main signs of injury to the ear. Small children often scratch or rub the ear repeatedly.</p>.<p><b>Ear wax impaction:</b> If impacted <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_wax/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">earwax</a> is the cause you may experience symptoms of a "fullness" or pressure, and a decrease in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing</a> on the affected side.

Pulling the back of the ear (the pinna) gently toward the back of the head straightens out the ear canal and the foreign body may roll or slide out with a gentle shake of the ear. Do not strike your head on the opposite side to try to dislodge the stuck item.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_a_doctor_or_other_health_care_professional_if_i_have_something_foreign_in_my_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The vast majority of foreign bodies in the ear are not true medical emergencies. Call a doctor or other health care professional if something is in your ear, but the symptoms are minor. This can usually wait until the morning if the office is closed.</p>.<p>Organic material (bugs, plants, or food) should be removed promptly due to the possibility of swelling of the material and rapid onset of infection.</p>.<p>If you have a swollen (inflamed) ear that's red and is displaced outward, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, discharge, bleeding, or increasing pain; see a doctor urgently. If the object in the ear is a battery, seek medical attention immediately. If you are unsure of the severity of the injury, see a doctor.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_a_doctor_or_other_health_care_professional_tell_if_theres_something_in_my_ear_tests_and_diagnosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A doctor or other health care professional usually can see the foreign body by directly looking in the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. A magnifying light with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> cone tip is slid into the ear canal to look at the structures inside. In cases involving children, it is important to realize there may be more than one foreign body, and other orifices (other ear, mouth, nose and rectum) also may need to be examined. Once the object is seen, there are many ways of retrieving it.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_to_remove_foreign_body_deep_in_the_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Foreign bodies stuck deep in the ear:</b> If the item is deeper in the ear than can be seen with the naked eye, a qualified medical professional should remove it. Don't stick anything into the ear to remove an object yourself, as you may push it in further and cause damage or rupture of the eardrum or scratch the skin of the ear canal.</p>.<p>At the doctor's office or in the emergency room the foreign body can be removed using several techniques. (Don't try these at home.)</p>.<p><b>Small children: </b>Small children don't tolerate painful or scary interventions, and may need to be sedated medically to have foreign bodies removed from their ears. Often with children, the first try is the most successful, as subsequent attempts to remove an object can be painful and frightening to the child.</p>.<p><b>Insects and bugs:</b> Insects in the ear canal are often killed with either <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">lidocaine</a> (an anesthetic) or mineral oil. They are then flushed out with gentle warm water irrigation.</p>.<p><b>Antibiotics:</b> After the foreign body is removed the doctor may put the patient on antibiotic drops for five days to a week to prevent infection from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> to the ear canal.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_other_types_of_ear_emergencies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
