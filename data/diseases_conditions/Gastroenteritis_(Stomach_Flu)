Symptoms also may be seen with other causes of stomach flu (drugs, food <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergies</a>, toxins), for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children with gastroenteritis or stomach flu usually have diarrhea, but may have other symptoms, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most viral and bacterial causes of the stomach flu can be transfer to other people by direct and indirect contact, usually by the fecal-oral route.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) is a common, worldwide disease and almost everyone suffers from it a few times in their life because it is almost impossible to avoid contact with some of the viral and bacterial causes.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending upon the cause of gastroenteritis, it may be considered acute or chronic.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bacteria and viruses -- infectious agents -- (the most common cause) are the most frequent causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and worldwide. Infections cause diarrhea and other symptoms by causing inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. The infections increase the fluid content in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> and colon by changing the gastrointestinal tract's ability to absorb water and by increasing the speed of transit (motility) for things you ingest. This, in turn, causes diarrhea. Infectious agents may physically damage intestinal cells directly or indirectly with secreted toxins.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_most_common_causes_of_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most prevalent cause of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and the world is <i> Norovirus</i>. It causes about 50%-70% of viral gastroenteritis cases, while <i> Rotavirus, Astrovirus, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Adenovirus</a></i>, and <i>Sapovirus</i> strains cause most of the other viral gastroenteritis infections. <i>Norovirus</i> also was listed as the leading cause of gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>.<p>Bacterial causes of gastroenteritis that occur worldwide are <i>Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter Aeromonas</i>, and <i> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Escherichia coli</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli_0157h7_escherichia_coli_0157h7/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">E. coli</a>) </i>strains of bacteria. Other bacteria like <i>Clostridium, Vibrio, Campylobacter</i>, and <i>Yersinia spp</i> can cause outbreaks occasionally. Occasionally, some bacterial causes of gastroenteritis (for example, <em>Salmonella</em> and , certain <em>E. coli</em> strains) may produce hemorrhagic or bloody diarrhea.</p>.<p>Parasites such as <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/giardia_lamblia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Giardia</a>, Cryptosporidium</i>, and <i>Entamoeba</i> infections can cause gastroenteritis and occasionally, other parasites have outbreaks such as the <i>Cyclospora</i> outbreak that occurred in 2012 to 2013 in the U.S.</p>.<p>There are many other less frequent causes of gastroenteritis such as food allergies (eosinophilic gastroenteritis), antibiotics, and toxins. Gastroenteritis symptoms are frequently listed as possible side effects of many medicines.</p>.<p>In most instances, food and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">drinks</a> come into contact with feces contaminated with the infecting agent. This can happen in the fields, or in transport, storage, and processing of food and drinks. In processed foods and drinks, this contamination is relatively rare, but when it occurs, an outbreak of the disease is often traced back to faulty equipment, human errors in the processing and/or a breakdown of quality-control procedures.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_know_i_have_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no specific tests for gastroenteritis, thus gastroenteritis is most often diagnosed by the symptoms it produces, mainly diarrhea. Because gastroenteritis is usually a self-limited disease, the large majority of people are never seen or diagnosed by a doctor. However, during outbreaks like those seen on cruise ships, viral and bacterial cultures or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a> and other immunologically based tests can eventually identify the causative pathogen. By the time this identification occurs, most of the individuals with gastroenteritis have begun to recover.</p>.<p>When gastroenteritis symptoms become severe, most public health officials and health care professionals run such tests to identify the causative agent of a specific disease, based on all of the history of the patients, physical exams, and symptoms. In addition, patients with similar histories of recent food or drink they had in common with others often helps to discover the source of the disease (for example, people who got diarrhea had salads from the same food source).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_and_home_remedies_help_soothe_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis_%0Asymptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_foods_are_recommended_to_eat_diet__when_you_have_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some health care professionals suggest a special diet for the gastroenteritis, especially for viral and/or bacterial infections in children. First and foremost is adequate fluid rehydration to prevent dehydration.</p>.<p>The diet frequently suggested is termed the "BRAT" diet. This diet consists of foods that are not usually irritating but soothing for the gastrointestinal tract. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_brat_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">BRAT diet</a> stands for bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. Although some doctors think this diet may not markedly benefit patients, others recommend it for both adults and children for a day or two to make the transition from the resolving symptoms of acute gastroenteritis to the patient's previously normal diet.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people with the stomach flu require no formal treatment. The key to a rapid and safe recovery at home (home remedy) is proper hydration. If dehydration occurs, the patient should be evaluated by a doctor. Many health care professionals choose to begin IV fluids, the treatment of choice for rapid rehydration.</p>.<p>Other medications may be prescribed to reduce the symptoms of gastroenteritis. To reduce vomiting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/promethazine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">promethazine</a> (Phenergan), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prochlorperazine-rectal/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prochlorperazine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prochlorperazine-rectal/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Compazine</a>), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ondansetron-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ondansetron</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ondansetron-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zofran</a>) are often used. Some physicians suggest using these agents only as a suppository or rapidly disintegrating tablet on the tongue since patients may vomit the pills up. Others may prescribe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenoxylate_and_atropine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">diphenoxylate and atropine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenoxylate_and_atropine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lomotil</a>) or lopermadine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loperamide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Imodium</a>) to slow diarrhea while others do not as the drugs may prolong the disease in some individuals. Many doctors recommend no medical treatment for gastroenteritis symptoms as all of the drugs have side effects and if the patient stays well hydrated, the symptoms usually stop soon anyway.</p>.<p>As the gastroenteritis symptoms abate, especially vomiting, doctors may recommend a BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apples and toast) for a day or two before returning to the patient's regular diet. Potatoes, lean meat like chicken and whole grains can help replace nutrients and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolytes</a> lost with diarrhea.</p>.<p>Patients who have more serious symptoms or other symptoms in addition to gastroenteritis need to be evaluated, diagnosed, and treated by a physician because the patient will likely have a specific disease that will need treatment. The treatment will depend on the cause of the illness (for example, salmonellosis or <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxin). Antibiotics and other treatments may not be recommended for some of these diseases so an accurate diagnosis of the disease is important. For <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infected patients, antibiotic sensitivity testing may need to be done to determine the most effective antibiotics to use.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_specialties_of_doctors_treat_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most individuals with viral or mild bacterial caused gastroenteritis require no treatment or can be treated by the patient's primary care provider or pediatrician. For more patients with more severe gastroenteritis, such infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> specialists, allergists, critical care physicians, and hematologists may be consulted.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_my_doctor_for_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If gastroenteritis symptoms last more than about five days, increase in severity (fever of 101 F or 38.33 C or higher), or a person develops bloody diarrhea, dehydration, constant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">abdominal pain</a> or other symptoms see a physician. The patient may have some gastroenteritis symptoms but may have a disease more serious than self-limiting gastroenteritis. Signs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of dehydration</a> may include decreased or no urine production, dry mucus membranes, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a> or skin, no tears, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lightheadedness</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a>, while children may show little or no urination, become lethargic, have skin that "tents up" when pinched. Signs of dehydration in anyone are good reasons to see a doctor immediately.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_complications_of_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most patients who get gastroenteritis have no complications and will completely recover. The major complication for some patients is dehydration; infants, children, the elderly and immunosuppressed are at higher risk for this complication. In many third world countries, hydration of infants is difficult at best so there are many infant deaths worldwide due to dehydration caused by gastroenteritis.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_you_prevent_from_getting_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no diet that will prevent gastroenteritis but food preparation plays a strong role in preventing gastroenteritis. In general, there are some actions people can do to prevent or reduce the chance of getting gastroenteritis, including:</p>.<p>There is a vaccine available against rotavirus that has reduced this infection in children. Also, there is a vaccine available against cholera-causing bacteria (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vibrio_infection_vibriosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt"><em>Vibrio</em></a>), but it is not widely available. A clinical trial of a Norovirus vaccine was done with some success. It is likely in the near future commercial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> against some causes will be available.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_person_who_gets_the_stomach_flu_gastroenteritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (outlook) for complete recovery is excellent in most people infected with viral and bacterial caused gastroenteritis, as long as the person keeps well hydrated. Because infants, children, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> women, and adults that are elderly or immunosuppressed, usually dehydrate faster than healthy adults and sometimes are more difficult to rehydrate orally, their prognosis can range from excellent to poor. Their prognosis depends on how dehydrated they become and how effective are the attempts to rehydrate the patient.</p>.<p>The prognosis for those patients that develop gastroenteritis symptoms as part of a specific disease process (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shigella_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shigellosis</a>) vary from good to poor, depending on the severity of the specific disease process.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
