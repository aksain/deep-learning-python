Iron is a part of all cells and does many things in our bodies. For example, iron (as part of the protein <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemoglobin</a>) carries oxygen from our <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> throughout our bodies. Having too little hemoglobin is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a>. Iron also helps our muscles store and use oxygen.</p>.<p>Iron is a part of many enzymes and is used in many cell functions. Enzymes help our bodies digest foods and also help with many other important reactions that occur within our bodies. When our bodies don't have enough iron, many parts of our bodies are affected.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_iron_deficiency_and_why_is_it_a_concern" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Iron deficiency is a condition resulting from too little iron in the body. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of anemia in the United States.<sup>1</sup></p>.<p>The terms anemia, iron deficiency, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">iron deficiency anemia</a> often are used interchangeably but equivalent. Iron deficiency ranges from depleted iron stores without functional or health impairment to iron deficiency with anemia, which affects the functioning of several organ systems.<sup>2</sup></p>.<p>Iron deficiency is a concern because:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_iron_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Iron deficiency has many causes. (See table below for a summary). These causes fall into two main categories:</p>.<p>Many common conditions can cause people to need additional iron:</p>.<p>The amount of iron absorbed from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> depends on many factors:</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_most_at_risk_for_iron_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_iron_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Too little iron can impair body functions, but most physical signs and symptoms do not show up unless iron deficiency anemia occurs. Someone with early stages of iron deficiency may have no signs or symptoms. This is why it is important to screen for too little iron among high risk groups.</p>.<p>Signs of iron deficiency anemia include<sup>12</sup></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_iron_deficiency_detected" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor or healthcare provider will do blood tests to screen for iron deficiency. No single test is used to diagnose iron deficiency. The most common tests for screening are</p>.<p>These tests show how much iron is in your body. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels usually aren't decreased until the later stages of iron deficiency, i.e., anemia.</p>.<p>Sometimes other blood tests are used to confirm that anemia is due to iron deficiency. These might include</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_iron_deficiency_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Again, it is important to be diagnosed by your healthcare provider because iron deficiency can have causes that aren't related to your diet. Your healthcare provider's recommendations will be specific to your needs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_i_do_to_prevent_iron_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In general, you can eat a healthful diet that includes good sources of iron. A healthful diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat free or nonfat milk and milk products, lean meats, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts, and is low in saturated fat, trans <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat_and_fats_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fats</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a>, salt, and added sugars.</p>.<p>In addition to a healthful diet that includes good sources of iron, you can also eat foods that help your body absorb iron better. For example, you can eat a fruit or vegetable that is a good source of vitamin C (see table on Dietary Sources of vitamin C) with a food or meal that contains non-heme iron (see table below for Dietary Sources of Iron). Vitamin C helps your body absorb the non-heme iron foods you eat, especially when the food containing non-heme iron and the vitamin-C rich food are eaten at the same meal.</p>.<p>The following recommendations are for specific groups who are at greater risk for iron deficiency.</p>.<p><b><a name="babies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="young_children_aged_1-5_years" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="adolescent_girls_and_women_of_childbearing_age" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="pregnant_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is recommended that pregnant women:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_much_iron_do_i_need" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have already been diagnosed with iron deficiency, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider about treatment.
