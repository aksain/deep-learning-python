Some are life-threatening (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a> and major <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>), and others are not so dangerous (such as simple <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strains</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contusions</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_shoulder_and_neck_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_shoulder_and_neck_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for shoulder and neck pain include athletic activity, heavy lifting, throwing, moving luggage or other heavy objects, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_shoulder_and_neck_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_seek_medical_care_for_shoulder_or_neck_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If pain or other symptoms start to worsen, call your doctor or immediately go to a hospital emergency department.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_treat_shoulder_and_neck_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Shoulder and neck pain is treated by primary care physicians, including general practitioners, internists, and family medicine doctors, as well as orthopedists, neurosurgeons, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatology/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatologists</a>, neurologists, and physiatrists.

However, your doctor may do a series of tests, depending on the cause of your injury, the location of your pain, or your other symptoms. The list is extensive and may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a>, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrocardiogram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ECG</a>), blood tests, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scans</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_home_remedies_for_shoulder_and_neck_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Minor injuries that have only slight pain can be treated at home.

The extent of recovery may be complete or limited. Some conditions can be recurrent or persistent; thus, you should have a treatment plan to learn how to deal with and adapt to any limitations.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
