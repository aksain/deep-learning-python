<p><b><a name="dystonia_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>*Dystonia facts medically edited by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_dystonia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dystonia is a disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The movements may be painful, and some individuals with dystonia may have a tremor or other neurologic features. There are several different forms of dystonia that may affect only one muscle, groups of muscles, or muscles throughout the body. Some forms of dystonia are genetic but the cause for the majority of cases is not known.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_dystonia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dystonia can affect many different parts of the body, and the symptoms are different depending upon the form of dystonia. Early symptoms may include a foot cramp or a tendency for one foot to turn or drag -- either sporadically or after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">running</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a> some distance -- or a worsening in handwriting after writing several lines.  In other instances, the neck may turn or pull involuntarily, especially when the person is tired or under <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>. Sometimes both eyes might blink rapidly and uncontrollably; other times, spasms will cause the eyes to close.  Symptoms may also include tremor or difficulties speaking.  In some cases, dystonia can affect only one specific action, while allowing others to occur unimpeded.  For example, a musician may have dystonia when using her hand to play an instrument, but not when using the same hand to type.  The initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>. Over a period of time, the symptoms may become more noticeable or widespread; sometimes, however, there is little or no progression. Dystonia typically is not associated with problems thinking or understanding, but <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> may be present.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_researchers_know_about_dystonia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of dystonia is not known. Researchers believe that dystonia results from an abnormality in or damage to the basal ganglia or other brain regions that control movement. There may be abnormalities in the brain's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters that help cells in the brain communicate with each other.  There also may be abnormalities in the way the brain processes information and generates commands to move.  In most cases, no abnormalities are visible using <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">magnetic resonance imaging</a> or other diagnostic imaging.</p>.<p>The dystonias can be divided into three groups: idiopathic, genetic, and acquired.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_do_symptoms_of_dystonia_occur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dystonia can occur at any age, but is often described as either early, or childhood, onset versus adult onset.</p>.<p>Early-onset dystonia often begins with symptoms in the limbs and may progress to involve other regions. Some symptoms tend to occur after periods of exertion and/or fluctuate over the course of the day.</p>.<p>Adult-onset dystonia usually is located in one or adjacent parts of the body, most often involving the neck and/or facial muscles.  Acquired dystonia can affect other regions of the body.</p>.<p>Dystonias often progress through various stages. Initially, dystonic movements may be intermittent and appear only during voluntary movements or stress. Later, individuals may show dystonic postures and movements while walking and ultimately even while they are relaxed. Dystonia can be associated with fixed postures and shortening of tendons.
</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_dystonias_classified" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>One way to classify the dystonias is based upon the regions of the body which they affect:</p>.<p>There are several different forms of dystonia.  Some of the more common focal forms are:</p>.<p>Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis or torticollis, is the most common of the focal dystonias. In cervical dystonia, the muscles in the neck that control the position of the head are affected, causing the head to turn to one side or be pulled forward or backward. Sometimes the shoulder is pulled up.  Cervical dystonia can occur at any age, although most individuals first experience symptoms in middle age. It often begins slowly and usually reaches a plateau over a few months or years. About 10 percent of those with torticollis may experience a spontaneous remission, but unfortunately the remission may not be lasting.</p>.<p>Blepharospasm, the second most common focal dystonia, is the involuntary, forcible contraction of the muscles controlling eye blinks. The first symptoms may be increased blinking, and usually both eyes are affected. Spasms may cause the eyelids to close completely, causing "functional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a>" even though the eyes are healthy and vision is normal.</p>.<p>Cranio-facial dystonia is a term used to describe dystonia that affects the muscles of the head, face, and neck (such as blepharospasm). The term Meige syndrome is sometimes applied to cranio-facial dystonia accompanied by blepharospasm.  Oromandibular dystonia affects the muscles of the jaw, lips, and tongue. This dystonia may cause difficulties with opening and closing the jaw, and speech and swallowing can be affected. Spasmodic dysphonia, also called laryngeal dystonia, involves the muscles that control the vocal cords, resulting in strained or breathy speech.</p>.<p>Task-specific dystonias are focal dystonias that tend to occur only when undertaking a particular repetitive activity.  Examples include writer's cramp that affects the muscles of the hand and sometimes the forearm, and only occurs during handwriting.  Similar focal dystonias have also been called typist's cramp, pianist's cramp, and musician's cramp. Musician's dystonia is a term used to classify focal dystonias affecting musicians, specifically their ability to play an instrument or to perform. It can involve the hand in keyboard or string players, the mouth and lips in wind players, or the voice in singers.</p>.<p>In addition, there are forms of dystonia that may have a genetic cause:</p>.<p>Recently, researchers have identified another genetic cause of dystonia which is due to mutations in the DYT6 gene.  Dystonia caused by DYT6 mutations often presents as cranio-facial dystonia, cervical dystonia, or arm dystonia. Rarely, a leg is affected at the onset.</p>.<p>Many other genes that cause dystonic syndromes have been found, and numerous genetic variants are known to date. Some important genetic causes of dystonia include mutations in the following genes:  DYT3, which causes dystonia associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">parkinsonism</a>; DYT5 (GTP cyclohydrolase 1), which is associated with dopa-responsive dystonia (Segawa disease); DYT6 (THAP1), associated with several clinical presentations of dystonia; DYT11, which causes dystonia associated with myoclonus (brief contractions of muscles); and DYT12, which causes rapid onset dystonia associated with parkinsonism.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatments_are_available_for_dystonias" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Currently, there are no medications to prevent dystonia or slow its progression.  There are, however, several treatment options that can ease some of the symptoms of dystonia, so physicians can select a therapeutic approach based on each individual's symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_research_is_being_done_on_dystonias" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The ultimate goals of research are to find the cause(s) of the dystonias so that they can be prevented, and to find ways to cure or more effectively treat people who are affected. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Stroke</a> (NINDS), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for brain and neuromuscular research. NINDS sponsors research on dystonia both in its facilities at the NIH and through grants to medical centers and institutions throughout the country. Scientists at other NIH institutes also conduct research that may benefit individuals with dystonia.  Scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are studying improved treatments for speech and voice disorders associated with dystonia. The National Eye Institute (NEI) supports work on the study of blepharospasm and related problems, and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Child Health</a> and Human Development (NICHD) supports work on dystonia, including the rehabilitation for the disorder. </p>.<p>Scientists at NINDS laboratories have conducted detailed investigations of the patterns of muscle activity, imaging studies of brain activity, and physiological studies of the brain in persons with dystonia.</p>.<p>Treatment studies, using surgery or medication, are being conducted in many centers, including the NIH. To learn more about clinical studies on dystonia, please go to <a onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.</p>.<p>Recently, the Dystonia Coalition—a clinical research network for dystonia— has been established with support from the NINDS and the NIH Office of Rare Disease Research as part of the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network. For more information on the clinical studies and patient registry established by the Dystonia Coalition, see <a onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" href="http://www.rarediseasesnetwork.epi.usf.edu/dystonia/" target="_blank">http://rarediseasesnetwork.epi.usf.edu/dystonia/</a>.</p>.<p>The search for genes responsible for some forms of dystonia continues. In 1989 a team of researchers mapped a gene for early-onset torsion dystonia to chromosome 9; the gene was subsequently named DYT1.  In 1997 the team sequenced the DYT1 gene and found that it codes for a previously unknown protein now called "torsin A."  The discovery of the DYT1 gene and the torsin A protein provide the opportunity for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prenatal</a> testing, allow doctors to make a specific diagnosis in some cases of dystonia, and permit the investigation of molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to disease.</p>.<p>The discovery of the mutation in “torsin A' has enabled scientists to study animal models into which the mutated gene has been introduced. Through research with patients informed by the latest discoveries from genetics and basic neuroscience, scientists and doctors hope to better understand dystonia and find more effective treatments.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_get_more_information_about_dystonias" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For more information on neurological disorders or research programs funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Stroke</a>, contact the Institute's Brain Resources and Information Network (BRAIN) at:
