<p><b><a name="introduction_to_spinal_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A spinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> can occur as a result of a procedure such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lumbar_puncture/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">spinal tap</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lumbar_puncture/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lumbar puncture</a>) or epidural block (such as that performed during a woman's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/labor_and_delivery/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">labor and delivery</a>). In these procedures, a needle is placed within the fluid-filled space surrounding the spinal cord. This creates a passage for the spinal fluid to leak out, changing the fluid pressure around the brain and spinal cord. If enough of the fluid leaks out, a spinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> may develop.</p>.<p>Because the design of spinal needles has been improved, spinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> after a spinal tap or administration of spinal anesthesia are rare. When epidural anesthetics are placed with a larger needle than that used for spinal anesthetics, however, the likelihood of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> is higher if the epidural needle should inadvertently pass through the dura matter (covering of the spinal cord).</p>.<p>A spinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> may occur up to five days after the procedure is performed. Such a headache may be prevented with bed rest after a procedure.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_spinal_headache" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The spinal headache often is described as "a headache like no other." Spinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> are much more severe when the person is in an upright position; they improve when the person lies down.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_spinal_headaches_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first course of treatment for spinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> involves supplying adequate hydration to try to increase cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Sometimes intravenous fluids (fluids administered into the veins) are given; other times the person is advised to drink a beverage high in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a>. Strict bed rest for 24-48 hours is also recommended.</p>.<p>In addition, if a person develops a spinal headache following a procedure, the anesthesiologist can create a blood patch with the person's blood to seal the leak. To administer a blood patch, the anesthesiologist inserts a needle into the same space as, or right next to, the area in which the anesthetic was injected. The doctor then takes a small amount of blood from the patient and injects it into the epidural space. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> and seals the hole that caused the leak.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
