<p><b><a name="celiac_disease_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_celiac_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. In some people who are 
exposed to gluten in their diet, an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase 
changes the gluten into a chemical that causes an immune response, leading to 
inflammation of the lining of the small intestine. The normal villi that make up 
the lining of the intestine are blunted and destroyed, preventing the normal 
absorption of nutrients from the diet.</p>.<p>This malabsorption of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">minerals</a>, and other nutrients may lead to 
damage to other organs in the body, such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a>, bone, and brain' that depend

develops antibodies against its own tissues. Researchers believe that other such 
diseases may be related, and may affect organs such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid</a> (autoimmune <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroiditis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroiditis</a>), the liver (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/primary_biliary_cirrhosis_pbc/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">primary biliary cirrhosis</a>), and colon (microscopic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colitis</a>).

associated with celiac disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_celiac_disease_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of celiac disease is often delayed and it may take several 
months or years for the patient and the health care professional to think of it as 
the cause of many non-specific symptoms. History and physical examination may 
give direction as to the diagnosis, but commonly it take many visits with the 
patient complaining of recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>, non-specific joint <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aches</a>, or 
demonstrating
chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> that does not respond to iron treatment, to raise 
the suspicion that celiac disease is a possibility.</p>.<p>When the diagnosis is suspected, there is a two-step screening process to 
make the diagnosis:</p>.<p>It is important that the patient eats a regular diet for many weeks 
before the testing procedures. If the patient has already started a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/celiac_disease_gluten_free_diet/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gluten free</a> 
diet, it may cause the tests to be falsely negative.</p>.<p>Once the diagnosis is made, screening for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a> may be appropriate.</p>.<p>Since it is often familial, once one person in the family is diagnosed with 
celiac disease, it is reasonable to have other close family members screened.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_celiac_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The only treatment for celiac disease and the inflammation of the small 
intestine caused by gluten protein exposure is a life-long <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gluten-free_diet_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gluten free diet</a>.</p>.<p>Latent or potential celiac disease describes those people suspected of 
having the disease with a positive antibody blood test, but whose small bowel 
biopsy is normal. Currently, there is no indication to begin treatment with a
gluten free diet, however, repeat biopsy might be considered if signs and 
symptoms develop or if symptoms of malabsorption are present.</p>.<p>Individuals may be screened for celiac disease and have both a positive antibody 
blood test and a positive small intestine biopsy, and yet have no symptoms. This 
is considered silent celiac disease and the recommendation is to perform further 
testing looking for malabsorption complications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>. A 
gluten free diet may be indicated if these tests are positive.</p>.<p>While a gluten free diet tends to resolve symptoms in most individuals, in a 
small group of patients, the gluten free diet fails to control the symptoms 
including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a> and malabsorption. These patients are considered 
refractory to diet treatment. It is important that other types of bowel disease, 
including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Crohn's disease</a> are first excluded before 
making this 
diagnosis. If diet therapy fails to resolve symptoms, refractory celiac disease is often 
treated with the same medications used in other autoimmune disorders to decrease 
inflammation. These medications include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corticosteroids</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisone</a>), 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azathioprine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">azathioprine</a> 
(Imuarn, Azasan) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine-oral_capsule/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cyclosporine</a>. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_celiac_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The inability to properly absorb vitamins, minerals and nutrients from the 
diet can affect many organs in the body. Since the diagnosis of celiac disease 
is often delayed, there can be significant issues with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">iron deficiency anemia</a>, 
osteoporosis because of decreased levels of calcium and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutritional_health_vitamin_d_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin D</a>, and poor 
growth and development.</p>.<p>Aside from the other associated autoimmune disorders that might also be 
present, celiac disease is associated with an increased incidence of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymphoma</a> 
and small intestine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>. This risk is reduced in patients who maintain a 
strict gluten free diet.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_gluten-free_diet" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gluten is a complex protein found in wheat, barley, and rye grains. A gluten free diet excludes exposure to any of the foods that have this protein in its ingredients. It is easy to understand that regular wheat bread or pizza dough has gluten in it. However, it is less easy to realize that wheat flour is often used in many processed foods and in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/recipes/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">recipes</a> for many foods that are prepared in a restaurant. Moreover, for it to be considered completely gluten free, processed foods should be prepared in a kitchen or factory that has no cross contamination with grains containing gluten.</p>.<p>The Federal Drug Administration has published new guidelines that define gluten free food as having less than 20 parts per million of gluten. Regulations regarding food labeling criteria require food to meet this standard to be labeled "gluten free." It is important to read the labels for all foods products. Aside from a gluten free designation, there may be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">food allergy</a> statements that discuss the factory or kitchen where the product was manufactured.</p>.<p>Many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eating_out_and_entertaining/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">restaurants</a> have gluten free menus or can accommodate the gluten free dietary needs of their customers, but it is important for the person to ask the server, manager, or cook directly about whether it contains gluten.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
