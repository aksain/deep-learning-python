 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wisdom_teeth/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Wisdom teeth</a>, otherwise known as third molars, are the last set of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a> to
develop. Sometimes these teeth emerge from the gum line and the jaw is large
enough to allow room for them, but most of the time, this is not the case. More
often, one or more of these third molars fails to emerge in proper alignment or
fails to fully emerge through the gum line and becomes entrapped or
"impacted" between the jawbone and the gum tissue. Impacted wisdom
teeth can result in swelling, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, and infection of the gum tissue surrounding
the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/wisdom_teeth_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wisdom teeth</a>. In addition, impacted wisdom teeth can cause permanent damage
to nearby teeth, gums, and bone and can sometimes lead to the formation of
 cysts or tumors that can destroy sections of the jaw. Therefore, dentists
recommend people with impacted wisdom teeth have them surgically removed.</p>.<p>It's not just wisdom teeth that sometimes become impacted and need to be
removed. Other teeth, such as the cuspids and the bicuspids can become impacted
and can cause the same types of problems described with impacted wisdom
teeth.</p>.<p>

 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_implants/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dental implants</a> are an option for tooth loss due to an accident or
infection or as an alternative to 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dentures/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dentures</a>. The implants are tooth root substitutes that are surgically
anchored in place in the jawbone and act to stabilize the artificial teeth to
which they are attached. Suitable candidates for dental implants need to have
an adequate bone level and density, must not be prone to infection, and must be
willing to maintain good oral hygiene practices.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="jaw" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="other" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.</p>.<p class="credits">Edited by Charlotte E.
