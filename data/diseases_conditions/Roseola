Their immune system clears the virus prior to the development of any symptoms. For those individuals who do develop an overt infection, the vast majority sustain no side effects. The rare individual with a compromised immune system may be at risk for a more complicated course of disease. This would include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">newborn</a> infants (first six to eight weeks of life), individuals receiving <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a>, or those with illness that impacts the immune system (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a>-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acquired_immunodeficiency_syndrome_aids/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">AIDS</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_roseola_spread_what_is_the_incubation_period_for_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_roseola_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The signs and symptoms of HHV-6 (or HHV-7) infection vary depending upon the age of the patient.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialties_of_doctors_treat_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pediatricians and family practitioners are capable of diagnosing and managing a child with roseola. Specialists (infectious disease experts) are rarely needed to assist in the care of this generally benign disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The characteristic clinical pattern of sudden onset of high fever and development of the typical rash at the time of fever resolution generally enables a rapid diagnosis without any laboratory studies. For unusual presentations, patients with complications or those with immune deficiency states, several forms of blood tests can assist in establishing the diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_high_can_the_fever_go_with_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The fever can be quite high. The fever averages 103.5 F (39.7 C), but it can go up as high as 106 F (41.2 C).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_home_remedies_for_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since roseola patients experience a moderate fever, medications to lower fever (antipyretics) are helpful in lowering fever and lessening any associated discomfort (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>). Such medications include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a>. A cool bath (approximate water temperature of 85 degrees) may also be therapeutic. No therapy is necessary regarding the rash of roseola since it does not cause symptoms, it is short-lived, and it resolves spontaneously.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_the_fever_of_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If the fever is not causing the child to be uncomfortable, the fever need not be treated. It is not necessary to awaken the child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by a health care professional.</p>.<p>If someone wants to treat the fever, acetaminophen (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a> and others) can be used. The dosage interval is every four hours. Ibuprofen (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Motrin</a>, and others) may be used in lieu of acetaminophen on an every six-hour basis. Both families of medication are equally effective in lowering a child's fever. There is no medical benefit alternating acetaminophen with ibuprofen. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aspirin</a> should never be used for fever in children or adolescents.</p>.<p>A child with a fever should be kept comfortable and not be overdressed. Overdressing can cause the temperature to go higher. Bathing with tepid water (85 F or 29.5 C) may help bring down a fever by 1 to 1.5 degrees. If a child develops shivering during the bath, the temperature of the bath water should be raised. Never sponge a child (or an adult) with alcohol; the alcohol fumes may be inhaled, causing many problems.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_%0Aone_do_if_his_or_her_child_with_roseola_has_a_seizure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The hardest thing to do is to keep calm while helping the child to the floor and loosening any clothing around the neck. Remove any sharp objects that could cause injury, and turn the child on one side so saliva can flow from the mouth. Putting a cushion or a folded coat under the head for a pillow is fine, but do not put anything in the child's mouth. The best thing is just to wait it out. Most <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/febrile_seizures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">febrile seizures</a> (whether associated with roseola or other viruses) last less than five minutes. Do not leave the child unattended while calling the paramedics of the doctor's office. Children are often drowsy and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> after a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizure</a>. That is normal. After the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">seizure</a>, contact the child's health care professional to determine if the child should be immediately examined.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_the_fever_cause_a_seizure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. The sudden and rapid rise in temperature elevation may trigger a seizure (a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">convulsion</a>). Febrile <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizures</a> (convulsions due to fever) are common (3%) in children between 18 months to 3 years of age. They occur in 5%-35% of children with roseola.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_a_seizure_due_to_fever_dangerous" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The seizure may look very frightening, but it is usually quite harmless (benign). Febrile <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epilepsy_and_seizures_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">seizures</a> are <i>not</i> associated with long-term nervous-system side effects or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">brain damage</a>. Anticonvulsant medications are very rarely prescribed for the treatment or prevention of febrile seizures.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_rash_with_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, but not in the beginning. When the fever disappears, a rash appears. The rash is mainly located on the neck and torso (the abdomen, trunk, and back), but it can also be on the arms and legs (extremities).</p>.<p>The rash may appear as separate little raised ("goose bump" size) dots (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">papules</a>) or as a flat (macular) rash. The skin is often mildly red in color and temporarily blanches with pressure. The rash is not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itchy</a> or painful. It is not contagious. The rash lasts one to two days and does not return.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_most_remarkable_characteristic_of_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>What is most striking is that the child seems so well despite having a high fever.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_roseola_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The fever of roseola lasts three to five days followed by a rash lasting about one to two days that resolves without treatment. Immunity to HHV-6 seems to be lifelong.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_any_complications_of_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications are rare with roseola except in children with suppressed immune systems. Individuals with healthy immune systems generally develop lifelong immunity to HHV-6 (or HHV-7).</p>.<p><b><a name="should_%0Aa_child_with_roseola_see_a_doctor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, an evaluation by a health care professional is a good idea. A child with a fever <i>and</i> a rash should <i>not</i> go back to child care until they are medically evaluated.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_can_the_child_return_to_child_care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A child with just the rash of roseola and no fever for 24 hours can usually return to child care.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_vaccine_for_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>At this time, there is no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> for roseola. Due to its generally benign nature and rare rate of complications, many researchers doubt that the high financial cost to develop such a new vaccine would be worthwhile.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The primary mechanism for HHV-6 or HHV-7 transmission is via human-to-human respiratory droplet secretions. Therefore, basic hand-washing and avoidance of acutely ill individuals (such as those with fever) is the best way to avoid contracting the illness. Day care centers and preschools should follow routine principles of hygiene and decontamination of toys and articles shared by their children.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_child_with_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>With the exception of immune-compromised patients, the prognosis for a child with roseola is excellent and no long-term side effects should occur.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_other_names_for_roseola" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Roseola is referred to by a number of other names. It was formally called roseola infantum or roseola infantilis. Because the rash appears so suddenly (right after the fever dramatically departs), the disease is commonly called exanthem subitum.</p>.<p>To distinguish roseola from other childhood diseases featuring skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rashes</a>, it was once dubbed "sixth disease" (because it was the sixth disease young children typically developed, and it lasted about six days). But that name has largely been forgotten.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
