Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_diabetic_neuropathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.</p>.<p>The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_diabetic_neuropathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_diabetic_neuropathy_be_reversed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_diabetic_neuropathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_diabetic_neuropathy_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatments_for_diabetic_neuropathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_home_remedies_help_relieve_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.
