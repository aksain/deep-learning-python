known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">large intestine</a> or large bowel, 
constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. The colon is a long, muscular 
tube that receives digested food from the small intestine. It removes water 
from the undigested food, stores the undigested food, and then eliminates it from the body through 
bowel movements. The rectum is the last part of the colon adjacent to the anus. The common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">symptoms of colitis</a> include:</p>.<p>There are many different types of colitis 
with different causes. Some examples of colitis include: </p>.<p>Infectious, radiation, ischemic, ulcerative, and Crohn's colitis all have 
visible abnormalities of the inner lining of the colon. These abnormalities 
include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">edema</a> (swelling of the lining), redness, bleeding from the lining with 
gentle rubbing (friability), and ulcers. These abnormalities can be seen during
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colonoscopy</a> (examination of the 
entire colon using a long flexible viewing tube) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flexible_sigmoidoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flexible sigmoidoscopy</a> 
(examination of the rectum and the sigmoid colon - the segment of the colon closest to the rectum). </p>.<p>Edema and inflammation of the colon's lining interferes 
with the absorption of water from the undigested food, and the unabsorbed water 
exits the rectum as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. Pus and fluid also are secreted into the colon and 
add to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. The redness, bleeding from the lining with gentle rubbing 
(friability), and ulcerations in the lining of the colon contribute to the rectal 
bleeding. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG-->

that is only visible when the colon's lining is examined under a microscope. The 
appearance of the inner colon lining in microscopic colitis is normal by visual 
inspection during colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. The diagnosis of 
microscopic colitis is made when a doctor, while performing colonoscopy or 
flexible sigmoidoscopy, takes biopsies (small samples of tissue) of the normal-appearing lining, and 
then 
examines the biopsies under a microscope. </p>.<p>There are two types of microscopic colitis: 1) lymphocytic colitis and 
2) collagenous colitis. </p>.<p>Some experts believe that lymphocytic colitis and 
collagenous colitis represent different stages of the same disease. </p>.<p>The inflammation and the collagen probably interfere with absorption of water 
from the colon, resulting in the diarrhea. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_microscopic_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause(s) of microscopic colitis is unknown. Some experts suspect that

watery diarrhea. Individuals with microscopic colitis can have diarrhea for months 
or years before the diagnosis is made. Typically, the symptoms begin very 
gradually and are intermittent in nature with periods when the person feels 
well, followed by bouts of chronic diarrhea. This chronic diarrhea of microscopic 
colitis is different from the acute diarrhea of infectious colitis, which typically lasts only days 
to weeks. Some individuals with microscopic colitis also may experience mild abdominal 
cramps and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_the_stool_rectal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Blood in the stool</a> is unusual. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_microscopic_colitis_and_who_is_at_risk" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prevalence of microscopic colitis in the U.S. is not clearly known.</p>.<p>Microscopic colitis most commonly occurs in the middle aged and elderly patients and is more common among women than men.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_seek_medical_care_for_microscopic_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A person should seek medical care if the diarrhea lasts for more than 2 weeks or is accompanied with symptoms such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_microscopic_colitis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of microscopic colitis is made by performing biopsies from different regions of the colon during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.</p>.<p>The abnormalities of the colon's lining in microscopic colitis occur in a patchy distribution (areas of normal lining may coexist adjacent to areas of abnormal lining). For this reason, multiple biopsies should be taken from several different regions of the colon in order to accurately make a diagnosis.</p>.<p>The patchy nature of microscopic colitis also is the reason why flexible sigmoidoscopy often is inadequate in diagnosing the condition because the abnormalities of microscopic colitis may be absent from the sigmoid colon (the colonic segment that is closest to the rectum and is within the reach of a sigmoidoscope) in some of the patients with microscopic colitis.</p>.<p>Thus, biopsies of other regions of the colon accessible only with colonoscopy may be necessary for diagnosing microscopic colitis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_microscopic_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of microscopic colitis has not been standardized because there 
have not been adequate large scale, 
prospective, placebo controlled treatment 
trials. The following strategies are safe and may relieve diarrhea in some 
patients: 
</p>.<p>Controlled trials showed that budesonide 
(Entocort, a poorly absorbed steroid) is effective in controlling diarrhea in 
more than 75% of the patients with collagenous colitis, but the diarrhea tends 
to recur soon after 
stopping Entocort. </p>.<p>Though data supporting their use is lacking, some doctors may use 
medications that potently suppress the immune system such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azathioprine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">azathioprine</a> 
(Imuran, Azasan) and 6-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mercaptopurine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mercaptopurine</a>
