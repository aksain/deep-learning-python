 Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_infertility" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In general, infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant (conceive) after one year of unprotected sex. Women who do not have regular menstrual cycles, or are older than 35 years and have not conceived during a 6-month period of trying, should consider making an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist - an infertility specialist. These doctors may also be able to help women with recurrent pregnancy loss - 2 or more spontaneous miscarriages.</p>.<p>Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps.</p>.<p>To get pregnant 
- </p>.<p>Infertility may result from a problem with any or several of these steps.</p>.<p>Impaired fecundity is a condition related to infertility and refers to women who have difficulty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">getting pregnant</a> or carrying a pregnancy to term. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_infertility_a_common_problem" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. About 6% of married women 15-44 years of age in the United States are unable to get pregnant after one year of unprotected sex (infertility).</p>.<p>Also, about 12% of women 15-44 years of age in the United States have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term, regardless of marital status (impaired fecundity).</p>.<p><b><a name="is_infertility_just_a_womans_problem" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both men and women contribute to infertility.</p>.<p>Many couples struggle with infertility and seek help to become pregnant; however, it is often thought of as only a women's condition. A CDC study analyzed data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and found that 7.5% of all sexually experienced men younger than age 45 reported seeing a fertility doctor during their lifetime - this equals 3.3-4.7 million men. Of men who sought help, 18% were diagnosed with a male-related infertility problem, including sperm or semen problems (14%) and varicocele (6%).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_infertility_in_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Infertility in men can be caused by different factors and is typically evaluated by a semen analysis. A specialist will evaluate the number of sperm (concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape). A slightly abnormal semen analysis does not mean that a man is necessarily infertile. Instead, a semen analysis helps determine if and how male factors are contributing to infertility.</p>.<p>
<b>Conditions that can contribute to abnormal semen analyses include -</b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_infertility_in_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women need functioning ovaries<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Other/disclaimer.html"></a>, fallopian 
tubes<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Other/disclaimer.html"></a>, and a uterus<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Other/disclaimer.html"></a> to 
get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these organs can contribute to 
female infertility. Some of these conditions are listed below and can be 
evaluated using a number of different tests.</p>.<p><b><a name="ovarian_function_presence_or_absence_of_ovulation_and_effects_of_ovarian_%0Aage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="tubal_patency_fallopian_tubes_open_blocked_or_swollen" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tubal Patency (whether fallopian tubes are open, blocked, or swollen).</p>.<p><b><a name="uterine_contour_physical_characteristics_of_the_uterus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_things_increase_a_womans_risk_of_infertility" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Female fertility is known to decline with</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_should_women_try_to_get_pregnant_before_calling_their_doctors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most experts suggest at least one year for women younger than age 35. However, women aged 35 years or older should see a health care provider after 6 months of trying unsuccessfully. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.</p>.<p>Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility.

They can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby, and can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_will_doctors_find_out_if_a_woman_and_her_partner_have_fertility_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors will begin by collecting a medical and sexual history from both partners. The initial evaluation usually includes a semen analysis, a tubal evaluation, and ovarian reserve testing.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_doctors_treat_infertility" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Infertility can be treated with medicine, surgery, intra-uterine insemination, or assisted reproductive technology.

Medical and surgical therapies are usually managed by an urologist who specializes in infertility. A reproductive endocrinologist may offer intrauterine inseminations (IUIs) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to help overcome male factor infertility.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medicines_are_used_to_treat_infertility_in_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include -</p>.<p>*Note: Use of trade names and commercial sources is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

</p>.<p>Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born prematurely (too early). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_intrauterine_insemination_iui" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often called artificial insemination. In this procedure, specially prepared sperm are inserted into the woman's uterus. Sometimes the woman is also treated with medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.</p>.<p>IUI is often used to treat-</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_assisted_reproductive_technology_art" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) includes all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled outside of the body. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman. The main type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF).</p>.<p>Success rates vary and depend on many factors, including the clinic performing the procedure, the infertility diagnosis, and the age of the woman undergoing the procedure. This last factor - the woman's age - is especially important.</p>.<p>CDC collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to the CDC's 2013 ART Success Rates, the average percentage of fresh, nondonor ART cycles that led to a live birth were -</p>.<p>40% in women younger than 35 years of age.</p>.<p>Success rates also vary from clinic to clinic and with different infertility diagnoses.</p>.<p>ART can be expensive and time-consuming, but it has allowed many couples to have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common complication of ART is a multiple fetus pregnancy. This is a problem that can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are transferred back to the uterus. For example, transfer of a single embryo, rather than multiple embryos, greatly reduces the chances of a multiple fetus pregnancy and its risks such as preterm birth.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_assisted_reproductive_technology_art" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Common methods of ART include: </p>.<p>ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who can not produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm is sometimes used when the woman or man has a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">genetic disease</a> that can be passed on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either parent. </p>.<p><b><a name="surrogacy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women with no eggs or unhealthy eggs might also want to consider surrogacy. A surrogate is a woman who agrees to become pregnant using the man's sperm and her own egg. The child will be genetically related to the surrogate and the male partner. </p>.<p><b><a name="gestational_carrier" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is fertilized by her partner's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the carrier's uterus.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
