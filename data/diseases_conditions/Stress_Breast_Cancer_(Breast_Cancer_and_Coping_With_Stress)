Prolonged stress may lead to frustration, anger, hopelessness, and -- at times -- <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>. The person with the illness is not the only one affected. Family members are also influenced by the health changes of a loved one. To reduce stress:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_learn_to_relax" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a number of exercises that you can do to relax. These exercises include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a>, muscle and mind relaxation, relaxation to music, and biofeedback. A few that you can try are listed below. First, be sure that you have a quiet location that is free of distractions, a comfortable body position (sit or recline on a chair or sofa) and a good state of mind. Try to block out worries and distracting thoughts.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_effective_relaxation_exercises" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Two-minute relaxation. </b>Switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. Take a few deep breaths, exhaling slowly. Mentally scan your body. Notice areas that feel tense or cramped. Quickly loosen up these areas. Let go of as much tension as you can. Rotate your head in a smooth, circular motion once or twice. (Stop any movements that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>.) Roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. Let all of your muscles completely relax. Recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. Take another deep breath and exhale slowly. You should feel relaxed.</p>.<p><b>Mind relaxation. </b>Close your eyes. Breathe normally through your nose. As you exhale, silently say to yourself the word "one," a short word such as "peaceful" or a short phrase such as "I feel quiet." Continue for 10 minutes. If your mind wanders, gently remind yourself to think about your breathing and your chosen word or phrase. Let your breathing become slow and steady.</p>.<p><b>Deep breathing relaxation.</b> Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breath into that spot and fill your abdomen with air. Let the air fill you from the abdomen up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. With every long, slow breath out, you should feel more relaxed.</p>.<p><b>How Can I Make My Life Better?</b></p>.<p>The most important step you can take is to seek help as soon as you feel less able to cope. (See "What Types Of Help Are Available?" below.) Taking action early will enable you to understand and deal with the many effects of your illness. Learning to manage stress will help you maintain a positive physical, emotional, and spiritual outlook on life.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_keep_track_of_my_medical_information" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_help_are_available" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many sources of help available to provide support for patients and their families. Among them are:</p>.<p><b>Social Workers.</b></p>.<p>Social workers are just one part of the care-giving team who can offer treatment in a compassionate setting. They can help you and your family discuss any concerns about your diagnosis, treatment, or personal situation.</p>.<p>Social workers can provide education, counseling regarding lifestyle changes, and referrals to community or national agencies and support groups. Your social worker can also help your family find temporary lodging in your community, provide information about community resources, and help you with any other needs.</p>.<p><b>Individual Counseling</b></p>.<p>Sometimes people have problems that are better addressed in a one-on-one atmosphere. By participating in individual counseling, you may feel more comfortable expressing sensitive or private feelings you have about your illness and its impact on your lifestyle and relationships.</p>.<p>Counseling services can help patients and their families discuss issues of concern and develop and enhance coping abilities. In addition, mental-healthcare providers can create a treatment plan to meet your specific needs. Strategies can be designed to help you regain a sense of control over your life and improve your quality of life, something everyone deserves. If necessary, medicine to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> may be prescribed.</p>.<p><b>Support Groups</b></p>.<p>Support groups are a very useful sharing experience. They provide an environment where you can learn new ways of dealing with your illness.</p>.<p>Sometimes, others who have been through similar experiences can explain things differently than your healthcare providers. You may also want to share approaches you've discovered with them. And you will gain strength in knowing that you are not facing hardships alone.</p>.<p>Remember that others may share information or experiences that do not apply to you. Never replace your physician's advice with that given to another patient.</p>.<p>The American <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cancer</a> Society's Reach to Recovery program offers special help to breast <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> patients.
