In most other blood tests in medicine, normal ranges can be set by taking measurements from large number of healthy subjects. The normal range of LDL cholesterol among "healthy" adults (adults with no known coronary heart disease) in the United States may be too high. The atherosclerosis process may be quietly progressing in many healthy children and adults with average LDL cholesterol blood levels, putting them at risk of developing coronary heart disease in the future.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_hdl_cholesterol_good_vs_ldl_cholesterol_bad_what_do_they_do" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_cholesterol_guidelines_to_prevent_heart_attack_and_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have guidelines to help health-care professionals counsel patients on how to decrease the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.

These four groups include patients:</p>.<p>The goal for statin therapy is to decrease the LDL blood levels. In patients' prescribed high intensity statin therapy, the goal is to lower LDL levels by 50%. For those who have medium intensity statin therapy, the goal is a LDL reduction of 30% to 50%.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_ldl/hdl_and_total/hdl_ranges_and_ratios" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The<strong> total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio (total chol/HDL) </strong>is a number helpful in estimating the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The number is obtained by dividing total cholesterol by HDL cholesterol.

Conversely, high HDL cholesterol and low total cholesterol lowers the ratio and is desirable.

Medications also can be combined to more aggressively lower LDL, as well as lower LDL and increase HDL at the same time.</p>.<p>Newer medications, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) have been approved to help lower LDL levels in certain pateints where diet and other statin medications have not worked adequately.</p>.<p>Note: Dosing guidelines change.

Like cholesterol, triglyceride in the blood comes either from the diet or the liver. In addition, like cholesterol, triglyceride cannot dissolve and circulate in the blood without combining with a lipoprotein.</p>.<p>The liver removes triglyceride from the blood and it synthesizes and packages triglyceride into VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) particles and releases them back into the blood circulation.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_elevated_triglyceride_levels" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>High triglyceride blood levels (hypertriglyceridemia) may be genetic or they may be acquired. Examples of inherited hypertriglyceridemia disorders include mixed hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.</p>.<p>Hypertriglyceridemia can often be caused by nongenetic factors such as obesity, excessive alcohol intake, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes mellitus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">kidney disease</a>, and estrogen-containing medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">birth control pills</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="do_high_triglyceride_levels_cause_atherosclerosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Whether elevated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/triglyceride_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">triglyceride levels</a> in the blood lead to atherosclerosis and heart attacks is controversial. While abnormally high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/how_to_lower_triglycerides_naturally/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">triglyceride levels</a> may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis, it is difficult to conclusively prove that elevated triglyceride by itself can cause atherosclerosis. Elevated triglyceride levels are often associated with other conditions that increase the risk of atherosclerosis including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obesity</a>; low levels of HDL cholesterol; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_resistance/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">insulin resistance</a>; poorly-controlled diabetes; and small, dense LDL cholesterol particles.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_elevated_blood_triglyceride_levels_be_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diet is the first step in treating hypertriglyceridemia. A low-fat diet, regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess weight, reduction of alcohol consumption, and stopping <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cigarette smoking</a> may be enough to control triglyceride levels in the blood. In patients with diabetes, meticulous control of elevated blood glucose is also important. This can be monitored by measuring the hemoblobin A1c levels in the blood.</p>.<p>When medications are necessary, fibrates (such as gemfibrozil [Lopid]), nicotinic acid, and statin medications can be used. Lopid not only decreases triglyceride levels but also increases HDL cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol particle size. Nicotinic acid lowers triglyceride levels and increases HDL cholesterol levels and the size of LDL cholesterol particles.</p>.<p>Statins are effective for decreasing triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels and, to a lesser extent, elevating HDL cholesterol levels.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
