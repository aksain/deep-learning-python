<p><b><a name="lichen_planus_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_lichen_planus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Lichen planus is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by small, flat-topped, polygonal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a> that may coalesce into rough, scaly plaques on the skin. There may also be involvement of the lining tissue (mucous membranes) of the mouth and/or vagina.</p>.<p>Lichen planus is a poorly understood skin condition. Its name is descriptive in that to some it resembles a simple plant, a lichen, which grows on rocks and tree bark, while <i>planus</i> is Latin for flat.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_lichen_planus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of lichen planus is unknown. In certain locales, patients with extensive lichen planus seem to be more likely to have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis C</a> virus infection of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>. However, it seems unlikely that the virus is the cause of lichen planus in such situations.</p>.<p>Some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, such as those containing arsenic, bismuth, or gold, can produce an eruption which appears identical to lichen planus. Exposure to certain chemicals used in the development of color photographs can also produce a similar <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>. The long-term use of the drugs quinacrine or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/quinidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">quinidine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/quinidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Quinidine Gluconate</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/quinidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Quinidine Sulfate</a>), may produce hypertrophic lichen planus of the lower legs. Lichenoid eruptions can occur in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/graft_versus_host_disease_gvhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">graft-versus-host disease</a> in people who have received bone marrow transplants. Tissue examination by a pathologist (biopsy) is frequently necessary to distinguish such lichenoid drug eruptions from classical lichen planus. Of course, stopping the offending drug is associated with resolution of the eruption.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_the_rash_of_lichen_planus_different_from_that_of_most_other_common_rashes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Lichen planus can be distinguished from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a>, and other common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rashes</a> purely on the basis of its clinical appearance in that lesions are small bumps or aggregations of bumps that are flat-topped, shiny, polygonal, and purple to grey in color. They tend to occur at the wrists and elbows and ankles. Individual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">papules</a> contain thin white lines called Wickham's striae. When lichen planus involves mucosal tissues, such as the lips or cheeks, these white filmy, web-like lines are easy to detect. It is not unusual for lichen planus to appear at sites of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>, especially along lines of scratches (excoriations).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_lichen_planus_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Lichen planus <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a> varies from mild to severe.</p>.<p>The onset of lichen planus can be sudden or gradual. The first attack may last for weeks or months, and recurrences may happen for years. The bumps at first are 2 mm-4 mm in diameter, with angular borders and a violet color. An excess of pigment (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/phytophotodermatitis_hyperpigmentation_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">hyperpigmentation</a>) may develop in the affected skin as the lesions persist. If lichen planus involves the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">scalp</a>, it can permanently damage the hair follicles, producing a patch of bald skin called lichen planopilaris. If lichen planus involves the finger or toenails, scarring often occurs, producing permanently malformed nails. Ulcerative lichen planus may occur if oral or vaginal lining tissue (mucosa) are involved.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_lichen_planus_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The appearance of lichen planus depends on whether the skin or the lining (mucous membranes) inside the mouth or vagina are affected:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_physicians_diagnose_and_treat_lichen_planus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most dermatologists, gynecologists, and some oral surgeons diagnose and treat lichen planus.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_lichen_planus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Usually, lichen planus is relatively straightforward to diagnose. Physicians can make the diagnosis in typical cases simply by looking at the rash. If necessary, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">skin biopsy</a> may be done to help confirm the diagnosis because, under the microscope, lichen planus is distinctive in appearance.</p>.<p>Because there are a number of other lichenoid eruptions that resemble lichen planus a biopsy confirmation is frequently necessary. Persistent oral or vaginal lichen planus, with spots that thicken and grow together, can sometimes be difficult to distinguish clinically from whitish <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">precancerous</a> plaques called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukoplakia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leukoplakia</a>. A biopsy can be helpful in this situation. There seem to be a few patients in whom ulcerative lichen planus precedes the development of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">oral cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_home_remedies_for_lichen_planus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although there is little objective evidence of its benefits, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/green_tea_camellia_sinensis-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">green tea</a> has been suggested as a treatment for lichen planus. It is likely to be a safe approach.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_lichen_planus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most lichen planus is relatively mild. Affected individuals who do not have symptoms do not need treatment. Ultimately, there is no agreed-upon cure for this condition.</p>.<p>If the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itch</a> or appearance of the rash are unpleasant, topical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroid</a> creams or topical calcineurin inhibitors like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tacrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tacrolimus</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pimecrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">pimecrolimus</a> may be of help. For localized, itchy, thick lesions, injections of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroids</a> directly into the plaque may helpful. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Antihistamines</a> may blunt the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itch</a>, particularly if it is only moderate. This effect is in part due to the sedative effect of antihistamines. For oral lesions, topical steroids (cortisone) in special oral preparations are available.</p>.<p>In more severe lichen planus, physicians may recommend oral medications or therapy with ultraviolet light. Oral medications may include a course of oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acitretin-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acitretin</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/griseofulvin-oral_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">griseofulvin</a>. Occasionally, other immunosuppressive agents may be employed. However, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a> may return after the drug has been discontinued. A low-dose oral corticosteroid every other morning may be also prescribed. For painful lesions within the mouth, special mouthwashes containing a painkiller (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">lidocaine</a>) before meals may provide some relief.
