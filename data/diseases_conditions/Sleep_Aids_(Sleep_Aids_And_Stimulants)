<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a> 
consumption and poor sleep hygiene. </p>.<p>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine estimates 30% of adults have some symptoms of insomnia, 10% have insomnia symptoms so severe they cause consequences such as daytime sleepiness, and less than 10% have chronic insomnia.</p>.<p>Insomnia may be classified by how long the symptoms are 
present.

</p>.<p>Transient insomnia may progress to short-term insomnia and without adequate treatment short-term 
insomnia may become chronic insomnia. </p>.<p>Some of the medications and substances that can contribute 
to insomnia are:</p>.<p>Insomnia can also result from poor sleep-related habits (poor sleep hygiene).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_natural_treatments_for_insomnia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several ways insomnia may be treated without use of 
	medication. These include behavioral modification and use of natural herbal 
	remedies.</p>.<p>When a person consults a doctor about insomnia, they may be asked to keep a sleep log for several weeks to monitor sleep habits. The treatment 
options for short-term or chronic insomnia include not only medications, but often sleep habit and behavioral modifications for optimal long-term results.</p>.<p>
Evaluating sleep habits is important in the management of insomnia. Treatment of 
underlying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep disorders</a> and in some instances, changing sleep habits may correct the problem without the need for medications. Good sleep habits

Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that helps regulate the body's clock or sleep-wake cycle. The secretion of melatonin is increased by darkness and decreased by light. The exact mechanism of how melatonin induces sleep has not been determined. Melatonin also decreases mental alertness and body temperature.</p>.<p>Melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement and is, therefore, not regulated by the FDA. It is commonly used for jet lag, insomnia, and sleep disturbances related to working night shifts. Some limited evidence suggests melatonin may be useful for treating sleep disturbances.</p>.<p>In 2005, MIT analyzed 17 peer-reviewed studies using melatonin. The analysis showed that melatonin was effective in helping people fall asleep at doses of 0.3 milligrams (mg). In some preparations the dosage of melatonin is significantly higher and these larger doses have shown to be less effective after only a few days of use. If possible, patients may want to stay with the same formulation or brand if it is effective for them.</p>.<p>If a person would like to try melatonin tablets, consult a doctor first.</p>.<p><b>Dosing:</b> There is no established dose or time of administration. Individuals should follow the product labeling for dosing and administration.</p>.<p><b>Pregnancy and lactation:</b> The use of melatonin during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> or lactation has not been studied adequately. Based on past experience with other agents and the possibility of unknown risks to the fetus, melatonin should be avoided during pregnancy while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breastfeeding</a>. Consult your doctor before you use melatonin if you are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> or breastfeeding.</p>.<p><b>Children:</b> The use of melatonin in children may be effective, particularly in children with disturbed sleep due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> spectrum disorders. However, it should not be used as a first-choice treatment in children. Consult your pediatrician before giving your child melatonin for sleep.</p>.<p><b>Drug interactions:</b> Although melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement, it should be thought of as a drug. It has side effects and may have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_interactions/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drug interactions</a> that have not been identified. The level of melatonin that the body produces is increased by certain drugs, such as selective <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">serotonin</a> reuptake inhibitor antidepressants or SRRIs (for example, fluoxetine [Prozac], <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sertraline/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sertraline</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sertraline/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Zoloft</a>], <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">paroxetine</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Paxil</a>]) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">monoamine oxidase inhibitors</a> (for example, tranylcypromine [Parnate], phenelzine [Nardil]). The interaction between these antidepressants and melatonin  used as a sleeping aid has not been assessed.</p>.<p><b>Side effects:</b> The most common adverse effect of melatonin is drowsiness. Therefore, tasks that require alertness (for example, driving) should be avoided for four to five hours after taking melatonin. Melatonin also may also cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a>, abnormal heartbeats, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>. Melatonin appears to be safe when used short-term (less than three months). Long-term side effects of melatonin are unkown.</p>.<p>Melatonin is either derived from animal sources or synthesized in a laboratory. Melatonin obtained from animal sources has a higher likelihood of contamination, which can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> reactions and viral transmission, than synthetic melatonin.</p>.<p>Melatonin may stimulate the immune system. People with severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a> or other disorders that may be caused by an overactive immune system (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rheumatoid arthritis</a>) should avoid using melatonin.</p>.<p><b>Other herbal products: </b> Natural herbal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a> such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valerian_valeriana_officinalis-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">valerian</a>, chamomile, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kava_piper_methysticum-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kava</a> kava, and others have been touted as remedies for insomnia; however, the safety or effectiveness of these products has not been documented.

OTC sleep aids should only be used for a short period of time in conjunction with changes in sleeping habits. Chronic use of these drugs may result in dependence on them. This creates a situation in which sleep is not possible unless the drug is used. Chronic insomnia should be evaluated by a physician. </p>.<p><b><a name="antihistamines" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diphenhydramine</a> (for example, Sominex, Nytol) and doxylamine 
(for example, Unisom) are antihistamines currently marketed as OTC sleep aids. Diphenhydramine is 
the only agent considered to be safe and effective 
by the Food and Drug Administration.  Other uses for diphenhydramine include 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/motion_sickness_sea_sickness_car_sickness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">motion sickness</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cough</a> suppression. 
Scientists believe that diphenhydramine and doxylamine 
cause sedation by blocking the action of histamine in the 
brain, but the exact mechanism of action is not known. </p>.<p>If insomnia is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, there are numerous 
products containing a combination of an antihistamine and 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/analgesics_antipyretics/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain reliever</a>. These combination products should not be 
used if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> is not present because the added pain reliever 
is not necessary.</p>.<p><b>Pregnancy and lactation:</b>  The effects of diphenhydramine 
and doxylamine on the fetus have not been evaluated 
adequately. Diphenhydramine  is classified as a pregnancy "category B" 
drug, and is routinely safely used during pregnancy. Although the likelihood of an adverse effect on 
the fetus is low, sleeping agents probably should be avoided 
during pregnancy. Both agents may decrease lactation 
(production of milk). Additionally, these drugs are 
secreted into the breast milk, which could affect the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">newborn</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Nursing</a> mothers should avoid both 
drugs. Consult a physician if you are pregnant and have insomnia.</p>.<p><b>Children: </b>Children less than 12 years of age should not use 
doxylamine because its use in this in age group has not 
been assessed.</p>.<p><b>Elderly:</b> Sedative effects of these drugs may interact with other 
potentially sedating medications. Consult a doctor before 
using these drugs.</p>.<p><b>Drug interactions:</b>  Diphenhydramine and doxylamine add 
to the sedative effects of alcohol and other medications 
that cause drowsiness.</p>.<p><b>Side effects:</b>  Drowsiness is the most frequent side 
effect of both diphenhydramine and doxylamine. These agents should not be used in situations where mental alertness is required 
(for example, driving). Diphenhydramine and doxylamine also cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a>, 
dry 
mouth, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/difficulty_urinating/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">difficulty urinating</a>. Both drugs may worsen the

children and the elderly.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_prescription_medicines_are_there_for_insomnia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are numerous prescription medications options a doctor may prescribe if a person is suffering from short-term or chronic insomnia. Most are not recommended for long-term use.</p>.<p>Medication to treat insomnia includes several classes of drugs;</p>.<p>In 2007, the FDA issued a warning in regard to sedative-hypnotic drugs and their risks, which "...include severe allergic reactions and complex sleep-related behaviors, which may include sleep driving. Sleep driving is defined as driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic product, with no memory of the event." The recommended dosing has recently changed ans is different based on gender and other factors. You should ask your doctor and pharmacist about appropriate levels and warnings.</p>.<p>If your doctor recommends prescription sleep medications:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_stimulant_products_are_available_otc" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with insomnia often suffer from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> as a 
result of sleep deprivation. Stimulant products are 
frequently used in an attempt to offset <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> and other 
unpleasant side effects that can accompany a lack of sleep. 
(These products are also used by people who need to stay 
awake for longer periods of time than is normal for them, 
such as for school examinations or long distance driving.)  
However, the use of stimulant products can also cause 
insomnia, leading to a counterproductive effort to deal 
with sleep deprivation.</p>.<p><b><a name="caffeine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Caffeine (for example, 
NoDoz, Caffedrine) is the sole active 
ingredient in most non-prescription stimulants. It is the 
only drug approved by the FDA for this purpose. Caffeine is 
used for improving alertness and for staying awake. 
Caffeine is a powerful stimulant, but tolerance (the need 
to use increasing amounts) can be developed.  Caffeine also 
is present in medications for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual cramps</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>, 
and colds. Additionally, caffeine is found in coffee, tea, 
soft <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drinks</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chocolate_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chocolate</a>. </p>.<p>Caffeine increases alertness by stimulating the nerves 
in the brain and spinal cord. It decreases muscle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> 
by stimulating muscle contraction. Caffeine also increases 
the heart rate and the force of contraction of the heart. 
The effect of caffeine varies among individuals and some 
people are only affected minimally.</p>.<p><b>Pregnancy and lactation:</b>  Studies have shown that 
moderate caffeine intake does not cause low birth weights, 
miscarriages, or premature births. However, there are 
reports of birth problems in women who consume more than 
300 milligrams per day of caffeine. Daily 
caffeine intake should probably be limited to less than 300 
milligrams during pregnancy. </p>.<p>Caffeine passes into breast milk. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concentration</a> 
of caffeine in breast milk is approximately one-percent of the 
amount in the mother's blood. A lack of sleep and 
irritation may occur in breastfed infants whose mothers 
consume more than 600 milligrams of caffeine per day. No 
adverse effects have been noted in breastfed infants whose 
mothers consume between 200-336 milligrams per day of 
caffeine. A mother can limit the amount of caffeine her 
infant receives by limiting the amount of her caffeine 
intake and ingesting the caffeine after nursing.</p>.<p><b>Children:</b>   Caffeine is not recommended for children less 
than 12 years of age.</p>.<p><b>Drug interactions:</b>

could lead to increased levels of caffeine in the body and, 
therefore, a higher likelihood of side effects. </p>.<p>Caffeine decreases the absorption of iron tablets. Iron 
should be administered one hour before or two hours after the 
consumption of caffeine.</p>.<p>Caffeine decreases the effects of sedatives, and
