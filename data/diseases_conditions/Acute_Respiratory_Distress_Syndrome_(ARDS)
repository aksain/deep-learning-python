ARDS can be life threatening because your body's organs need oxygen-rich blood to work well.</p>.<p>People who develop ARDS often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. They might already be in the hospital when they develop ARDS.</p>.<p><span style="vertical-align: sub;">To understand ARDS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).</span></p>.<p><span style="vertical-align: sub;"></span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">Small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. Oxygen passes from the air sacs into the capillaries and then into the bloodstream. Blood carries the oxygen to all parts of the body, including the body's organs.</span></p>.<p><span style="vertical-align: sub;"></span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">In ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause the lung's capillaries to leak more fluid than normal into the air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.</span></p>.<p><span style="vertical-align: sub;"></span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">As a result, the body's organs (such as the kidneys and brain) don't get the oxygen they need. Without oxygen, the organs may not work well or at all.</span></p>.<p><span style="vertical-align: sub;"></span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">People who develop </span>ARDS<span style="vertical-align: sub;"> often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to </span>ARDS<span style="vertical-align: sub;">, such as severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">pneumonia</a>.</span></p>.<p><span style="vertical-align: sub;"></span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">If you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 9-1-1.</span></p>.<p><b><a name="ards_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and a low blood oxygen level.</p>.<p>Other signs and symptoms depend on the cause of the ARDS. They may occur before ARDS develops. For example, if pneumonia is causing ARDS, you may have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a> before you feel short of breath.</p>.<p>Sometimes, people who have ARDS develop signs and symptoms such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure_hypotension_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">low blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">confusion</a>, and extreme tiredness. This may mean that the body's organs, such as the kidneys and heart, aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood.</p>.<p>Most people who develop ARDS are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.</p>.<p>If you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 9-1-1.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_ards" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many conditions or factors can directly or indirectly injure the lungs and lead to ARDS. Some common ones are:</p>.<p>It's not clear why some very sick or seriously injured people develop ARDS and others don't. Researchers are trying to find out why ARDS develops and how to prevent it.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People at risk for ARDS have a condition or illness that can directly or indirectly injure their lungs.</p>.<p>Conditions that can directly injure the lungs include:</p>.<p>Conditions that can indirectly injure the lungs include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_doctors_diagnose_the_condition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.</p>.<p>Your doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ARDS.</p>.<p>Your doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a>. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.</p>.<p>ARDS may cause abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds.</p>.<p>He or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body. Extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems.</p>.<p>Your doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips. A bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen. This is a possible sign of ARDS.</p>.<p>You may have ARDS or another condition that causes similar symptoms. To find out, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.</p>.<p>The first tests done are:</p>.<p>Other tests used to diagnose ARDS include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_ards_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>ARDS is treated in a hospital's intensive care unit. Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.</p>.<p>One of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.</p>.<p>Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endotracheal_intubation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breathing tube</a>. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.</p>.<p>Before inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.</p>.<p>The breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.</p>.<p>Your doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.</p>.<p>You'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).</p>.<p>This procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tracheostomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">tracheostomy</a> (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.</p>.<p>Supportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_from_ards" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are:</p>.<p><b><a name="living_with_ards" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some people fully recover from ARDS. Others continue to have health problems. After you go home from the hospital, you may have one or more of the following problems:</p>.<p>These health problems may go away within a few weeks, or they may last longer. Talk with your doctor about how to deal with these issues. Also, see the suggestions below.</p>.<p>You can take steps to recover from ARDS and improve your quality of life. For example, ask your family and friends for help with everyday activities.</p>.<p>If you smoke, quit. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Smoking</a> can worsen lung problems. Talk to your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/secondhand_smoke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">secondhand smoke</a> and other lung irritants, such as harmful fumes.</p>.<p>If you have trouble quitting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">smoking</a> on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">quit smoking</a>.</p>.<p>Go to pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) if your doctor recommends it. Rehab might include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> training, education, and counseling. Rehab can teach you how to return to normal activities and stay active.</p>.<p>Your rehab team might include doctors, nurses, and other specialists. They will work with you to create a program that meets your needs.</p>.<p>Living with ARDS may cause fear, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">depression</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking with a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life.</p>.<p>Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with ARDS. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk to your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center.</p>.<p>Support from family and friends also can help relieve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anxiety</a>. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_and_survival_rate_for_ards" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>More people are surviving ARDS now than in the past. One likely reason for this is that treatment and care for the condition have improved. Survival rates for ARDS vary depending on age, the underlying cause of ARDS, associated illnesses, and other factors. Some studies estimate that the mortality rate for ARDS is 36% to 52% per 100,000 people, depending upon their current health condition.</p>.<p>Some people who survive recover completely. Others may have lasting damage to their lungs and other health problems.</p>.<p>Researchers continue to look for new and better ways to treat ARDS.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_other_names_for_ards" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
