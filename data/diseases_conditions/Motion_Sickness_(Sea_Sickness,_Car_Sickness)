inner ear is different from the motion you visualize. It is a common condition 
that occurs in some people who travel by car, train, airplane or boat. Many 
people suffer from this condition if they ride on a roller coaster or other 
similar amusement park rides. Motion sickness progresses from a feeling of 
uneasiness to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sweating</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>. This is usually quickly followed by

almost anyone that is traveling is at risk for motion sickness. For those people 
who travel on boats, seasickness can be considered a form of motion sickness. 
Other risk factors include the person's fear or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> about traveling, the 
mode of travel, poor ventilation in the traveling vehicle, and the inability to 
see out of a window to aid orientation.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_of_motion_sickness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Motion sickness is caused by the mixed signals sent to the brain by the eyes 
and the inner ear (semicircular canals). If you cannot see the motion your 
body's feeling, or conversely, if you cannot feel the motion your eyes see, then 
it is likely that the brain will get mixed signals and the person will develop 
some aspect or symptom of motion sickness.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_motion_sickness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The signs and symptoms of motion sickness usually begin with a feeling of 
uneasiness followed by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> sweats and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>. Some people may exhibit pale

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> usually occur after these initial symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_a_doctor_for_motion_sickness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most cases, a doctor doesn't need to be called for motion sickness unless 
the person starts to develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a> from persistent and intractable 
vomiting. In most people, once the motion has stopped, the symptoms slowly 
decrease and then disappear.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_motion_sickness_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In general, motion sickness is diagnosed by the patient's history and 
physical examination. The individual's description of symptoms and the context 
in which they occur is most often sufficient to make the diagnosis. Laboratory 
testing is not generally required.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_motion_sickness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for motion sickness can consist of medical treatment, simple 
changes in the environment (for example, sitting by the open window of a car), 
over-the-counter (OTC) medications and for some people, home remedies may be 
effective. In addition, some patients respond well to biofeedback training and 
relaxation techniques.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="home_remedies_for_motion_sickness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although few, if any, studies have examined the effectiveness of home 
remedies, people have used herbs such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ginger_zingiber_officinale-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ginger</a>, peppermint, and tea as home 
remedies for motion sickness. In addition, some people respond well to

used to relieve and in some cases prevent motion sickness. Some of the more 
common medications that can be used for motion sickness include:</p>.<p>Before taking any of these medications, read the precautions as many of these 
medications have side effects that include drowsiness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dry mouth</a>, blurry vision,

listed above, as they are often administered before a person is likely to 
experience motion sickness. Most of these medications are designed to prevent 
motion sickness rather than to cure it.</p>.<p>There are other ways to reduce or prevent motion sickness without the use of 
medication. The following is a list of suggestions that may help reduce or 
prevent motion sickness: </p>.<p>There are companies that market bracelets and bands which claim that 
they can prevent motion sickness using acupressure technology against certain 
pressure points, so that the transmission of nausea is blocked before it can be 
registered by the brain. Though these products may work for some people, most 
evidence is anecdotal and large studies have not been conducted to prove 
efficacy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
