<p><b><a name="what_is_a_rapid_strep_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The rapid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strep</a> test is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool used to 
determine whether or not strep bacteria are present in the patient's throat. The 
same test may be used to evaluate for the presence of <i>Streptococci</i> in other 
infected areas (for example, perianal infection in either gender, or vulvar 
infection in pre-pubertal girls).</p>.<p><b><a name="streptococcal_throat_infections_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The pediatric population may have different <b>strep throat (GAS) symptoms</b>:</p>.<p>The majority of sore throats (70% to 85%) are caused by viruses. Representative examples are: </p>.<p>Unfortunately, no single characteristic element of 
either the patient's history or physical examination discriminates between strep 
thraot (GAS) and 
non-strep <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>. As a result, it is imperative to have laboratory evaluation since 
strep 
throat should be 
treated with antibiotics, while relief of symptoms remains the mainstay of 
treatment for viral sore throats.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_identification_of_streptococcal_infection_important" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients benefit both immediately and potentially in the long-term by rapid 
confirmation of <i>streptococcal</i> cause of their sore throat. Antibiotic treatment 
provides a quicker reduction of symptoms, shortens the duration of illness and 
quickly, and efficiently eliminates the possibility of spread of infection to 
others. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_traditional_test_for_strep_throat" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The traditional test for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strep throat</a> has been a throat culture. The major 
drawback of a throat culture is that the results take two to three days due to 
the time necessary to allow enough GAS bacteria to grow to enable accurate 
identification.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_the_rapid_test_better" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>By comparison with culture methods, a rapid strep test is much quicker and 
can produce results within minutes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_rapid_strep_test_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Obtaining a specimen is the same whether your doctor will do a throat culture 
or rapid test for strep. A cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) is quickly rubbed 
over both <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adenoids_and_tonsils/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tonsils</a> as well as the back wall of the mouth (the posterior pharynx). 
It is important to avoid contact with other structures inside the mouth such as 
the tongue or cheeks. The 
swab is then placed in a specialized container and the rapid test performed. 
Many people find that obtaining the swab produces a gagging sensation. However, since the entire swabbing process lasts less than 
five seconds this inconvenience is minimal.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_limitations_of_the_rapid_strep_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several manufactures of rapid strep tests. Each manufacturer has designed 
their test to 
respond only to the presence of the particular <i>streptococcal</i> bacteria (Group A) 
responsible for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/strep_throat_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strep throat</a>. Other bacteria which are less much less likely to 
cause sore throats are not identified by the rapid strep test. </p>
