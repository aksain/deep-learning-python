A prolactinoma produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is a natural hormone which supports a woman's normal lactation, which is the secretion of milk by the mammary glands of the breast. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary tumor. Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues or by excessive release of prolactin from the tumor into the blood (causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_normal_function_of_prolactin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prolactin stimulates the breast tissues to enlarge during 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>.  After delivery of the baby, the mother's prolactin level falls unless she breastfeeds her infant.  Each time the baby nurses from the breasts, prolactin levels rise to maintain milk production.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_pituitary_gland" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sometimes called the master gland, the pituitary gland plays a critical role in regulating growth and development, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss_boost_metabolism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a>, and reproduction.  This gland produces prolactin and a number of other key hormones including:</p>.<p><b><a name="where_is_the_pituitary_gland_located" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The pituitary gland is located in the middle of the head in a bony box that looks like a saddle and is called the sella turcica. Since the pituitary is in such a tight space, any abnormal growth can result in signs and symptoms secondary to compression of the gland. The nerves for the eyes pass directly above the pituitary gland.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_problems_are_caused_by_a_pituitary_tumor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pituitary tumors may impair or cause an increase in the production of one or more pituitary hormones. The lesion itself can damage surrounding normal tissue and thereby reduce the function of the pituitary gland (a condition called hypopituitarism).</p>.<p>
Enlargement of the pituitary gland can also cause local symptoms, such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> (because of increased pressure if the fluid system bathing the brain is blocked or stimulated), or visual disturbances (because of the proximity of the pituitary gland to the optic nerves).
</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_a_prolactinoma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prolactinoma is one of the common type of pituitary tumors. Routine  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autopsy</a> (postmortem) studies have shown that about a quarter of the U.S. population have small pituitary tumors. About 40% of these pituitary tumors produce prolactin, but most are not considered clinically significant because they cause no symptoms or problems. Clinically significant pituitary tumors affect the health of approximately 14 out of 100,000 people (or 1 in about 7,000 people).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_prolactinomas" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prolactinomas are usually classified into 2 groups: <b>microadenomas</b> are less than 1 cm while <b>macroadenomas</b> are above 8mm. The size may play a role in symptoms caused by local compression, and may determine the therapy of choice.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_prolactinoma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although research continues to find causes of disordered cell growth, the sources of many pituitary tumors, including 
prolactinomas, still remain unknown.</p>.<p>
Most pituitary tumors appear sporadically, meaning that no one else in the family has had a pituitary tumor. </p>.<p>
Some patients with prolactinomas have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">genetic disorder</a> called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1).  MEN1 is an inherited condition characterized by a high frequency of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peptic_ulcer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">peptic ulcer</a> disease and abnormal hormone production from the pancreas, parathyroid, and pituitary glands.  Prolactinomas are a characteristic feature of MEN1.</p>.<p>
A small number of people have a familial tendency to develop prolactinomas but do not appear to have MEN1.  The gene(s) responsible for such cases of prolactinoma have not yet been fully identified.
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_symptoms_are_caused_by_a_prolactinoma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In women, high blood levels of prolactin usually interfere with ovulation, causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a> and changing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstruation</a>.  In some women, periods may disappear altogether whereas in others, periods become irregular, or menstrual flow may change noticeably.  Women who are not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nursing</a> may begin producing breast milk.  Some women may experience a loss of libido (interest in sex).  Intercourse may become painful because of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_dryness_and_vaginal_atrophy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal dryness</a>.</p>.<p>
In men, the most common symptom of prolactinoma is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impotence</a>.  Men have no reliable indicator such as menstruation to signal a problem.  Thus, many men delay going to the doctor until they have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> or vision problems, caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the nearby nerves from the eyes.  Men may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido.  In fact, only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function. As a result of later presentation, men on average, have larger prolactinomas at their presentation then women.

causes other than a prolactinoma. Other causes include:
</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_prolactinoma_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Elevations of the prolactin hormone in the body are detected by a blood test.  Prolactin blood levels are often  indicated in women with unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea), irregular menses, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a> and,  in men with impaired sexual function or milk secretion (very rare in men).</p>.<p>If the prolactin level is high, thyroid function will usually be 
checked and questions asked about conditions and medications known to 
raise prolactin secretion.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>) is the most sensitive test for 
detecting and measuring prolactinomas. MRI scans may be repeated 
periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. 
Computer tomography (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>) also provides an image of the 
pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI for detection of a prolactinoma.</p>.<p>In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumor on the 
MRI, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_follow-up_tests_are_done_after_a_prolactinoma_diagnosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When a prolactinoma is found, other tests are often done to assess production of additional hormones from the pituitary gland.</p>.<p>
Depending on the size of the tumor, the doctor may also request an eye exam to measure visual fields. Remember that the optic nerves run close to the pituitary gland, and any growth of this gland may lead to impingement  on the these nerves.
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_goals_of_treatment_of_a_prolactinoma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The goals for treatment of a prolactinoma are to:</p>.<p>If the tumor is very large, only partial achievement of these goals may be possible.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_prolactinoma_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prolactinomas are usually initially treated with medications. 
</p>.<p>Surgery is considered if the medications cannot be tolerated, or if 
they are not effective.</p>.<p>The medical treatment may be only partially 
successful. In such cases, the medications may be combined with 
surgery or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation therapy</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_are_used_to_treat_prolactinomas" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because dopamine is the chemical in the brain that normally 
inhibits prolactin secretion, doctors may treat prolactinomas with 
drugs that act like dopamine such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bromocriptine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bromocriptine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bromocriptine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parlodel</a>) or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cabergoline-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cabergoline</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cabergoline-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dostinex</a>). 
Both bromocriptine (Parlodel) and cabergoline (Dostinex) have been 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of hyperprolactinemia (high blood prolactin levels). 
Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is also approved for the treatment of 
infertility. Treatment with these drugs is successful in shrinking 
the tumor and returning prolactin levels to normal in approximately 
80% of cases, or four out of every five patients.</p>.<p>Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is associated with side effects such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>.  To avoid these side effects, it is important that the dose of bromocriptine be increased slowly. Transvaginal use of bromocriptine is documented as a safe alternative route for delivery if nausea is excessive. In general, side effects typically disappear while the drug continues to lower prolactin levels.</p>.<p>Bromocriptine (Parlodel) treatment should not be interrupted 
without consulting a qualified endocrinologist. Prolactin levels 
often rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In 
some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may 
suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every two years on a 
trial basis.</p>.<p>Cabergoline (Dostinex) is also associated with side effects such as nausea and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>, but these effects are usually less common and less severe than with bromocriptine.  As with bromocriptine therapy, side effects may be avoided if treatment is started gradually. Recently, the use of Dostinex has been linked to heart valve problems. Many 
endocrinologists are using Dostinex as a last resort if bromocriptine simply cannot be tolerated. </p>.<p>
If side effects develop with a higher dose, the doctor may return to the previous dosage.  If a patient's prolactin blood level remains normal for 
six months, the doctor might consider stopping treatment.</p>.<p>
Medical therapy can often shrink a prolactinoma such that surgery is not required.
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_surgical_treatment_of_a_prolactinoma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The surgical treatment of prolactinomas involves delicately 
opening the brain to remove the tumor in the pituitary gland.</p>.<p>The results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin level as well as the skill and experience of the neurosurgeon.  The higher the prolactin level, the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin.  At best, surgery corrects prolactin levels in 80% of patients whose blood prolactin level is below 250 mg/mL.  Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range after surgery.  Drug therapy may also be started before surgery to 
"debulk" the tumor for the surgical procedure. Depending on the size of the tumor and how much of it is removed, studies show that in 20% to 50% of cases, the tumor will return, usually within 
five years.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_choose_a_skilled_neurosurgeon" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because the results of surgery are so dependent on the skill and 
knowledge of the neurosurgeon, patients should ask the surgeon about 
the number of operations he or she has performed to remove pituitary 
tumors, and for success and complication rates in comparison to major 
medical centers. Surgeons who have performed many hundreds or even 
thousands of such operations usually produce the best results.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_a_prolactinoma_affect_pregnancy_and_oral_contraceptives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If a woman has a small prolactinoma, there is usually no reason 
that she cannot conceive and have a normal 
pregnancy after successful 
medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production 
increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary 
disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience 
further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during 
pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in 
less than one percent of pregnant women with prolactinomas. In women 
with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves 
is greater. If a woman has already completed a successful pregnancy, 
the likelihood of future successful pregnancies is extremely high.</p>.<p>A woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive 
with her physician so she can be carefully evaluated prior to 
pregnancy. This evaluation typically includes a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye 
examination with measurement of visual fields.</p>.<p>As soon as the patient becomes pregnant, her doctor will usually 
advise that she discontinue bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline 
(Dostinex). Patients should consult their hormone specialists 
(endocrinologists) promptly if symptoms develop - particularly

treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if 
symptoms occur as a result of growth of the tumor during pregnancy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="do_prolactinomas_affect_oral_contraceptives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the past, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">oral contraceptives</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth control pills</a>) were

this notion is no longer held to be true. Patients with prolactinomas

post-menopausal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogen replacement</a> is safe in patients with
