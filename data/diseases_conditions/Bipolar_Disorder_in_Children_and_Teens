It is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">manic</a>-depressive illness or manic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">depression</a>. Children with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bipolar disorder</a> go through unusual mood changes. Sometimes they feel very happy or "up," and are much more energetic and active than usual, or than other kids their age. This is called a manic episode. Sometimes children with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_mania_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">bipolar disorder</a> feel very sad and "down," and are much less active than usual. This is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">depression</a> or a depressive episode.</p>.<p>Bipolar disorder is not the same as the normal ups and downs every kid goes through. Bipolar symptoms are more powerful than that. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">mood swings</a> are more extreme and are accompanied by changes in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>, energy level, and the ability to think clearly. Bipolar symptoms are so strong, they can make it hard for a child to do well in school or get along with friends and family members. The illness can also be dangerous. Some young people with bipolar disorder try to hurt themselves or attempt <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">suicide</a>.</p>.<p>Children and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a> with bipolar disorder should get treatment. With help, they can manage their symptoms and lead successful lives.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_develops_bipolar_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anyone can develop bipolar disorder, including children and teens. However, most people with bipolar disorder develop it in their late teen or early adult years. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_does_someone_develop_bipolar_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors do not know what causes bipolar disorder, but several things may contribute to the illness. Family genes may be one factor because bipolar disorder sometimes runs in families. However, it is important to know that just because someone in your family has bipolar disorder, it does not mean other members of the family will have it as well.</p>.<p>Another factor that may lead to bipolar disorder is the brain structure or the brain function of the person with the disorder. Scientists are finding out more about the disorder by studying it. This research may help doctors do a better job of treating people. Also, this research may help doctors to predict whether a person will get bipolar disorder. One day, doctors may be able to prevent the illness in some people.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_bipolar_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bipolar "mood episodes" include unusual mood changes along with unusual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> habits, activity levels, thoughts, or behavior. In a child, these mood and activity changes must be very different from their usual behavior and from the behavior of other children. A person with bipolar disorder may have manic episodes, depressive episodes, or "mixed" episodes. A mixed episode has both manic and depressive symptoms. These mood episodes cause symptoms that last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day.</p>.<p>Children and teens having a manic episode may:</p>.<p>Children and teens having a depressive episode may:</p>.<p><b><a name="can_children_and_teens_with_bipolar_disorder_have_other_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Young people with bipolar disorder can have several problems at the same time. These include:</p>.<p>Sometimes behavior problems go along with mood episodes. Young people may take a lot of risks, such as driving too fast or spending too much money. Some young people with bipolar disorder think about suicide. <b>Watch for any signs of suicidal thinking. Take these signs seriously and call your child's doctor</b>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_bipolar_disorder_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An experienced doctor will carefully examine your child. There are no blood tests or brain scans that can diagnose bipolar disorder. Instead, the doctor will ask questions about your child's mood and sleeping patterns. The doctor will also ask about your child's energy and behavior. Sometimes doctors need to know about medical problems in your family, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">depression</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">alcoholism</a>. The doctor may use tests to see if something other than bipolar disorder is causing your child's symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_bipolar_disorder_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Right now, there is no cure for bipolar disorder. Doctors often treat children who have the illness in much the same way they treat adults. Treatment can help control symptoms. Steady, dependable treatment works better than treatment that starts and stops. Treatment options include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_children_and_teens_expect_from_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>With treatment, children and teens with bipolar disorder can get better over time. It helps when doctors, parents, and young people work together.</p>.<p>Sometimes a child's bipolar disorder changes. When this happens, treatment needs to change too. For example, your child may need to try a different medication. The doctor may also recommend other treatment changes. Symptoms may come back after a while, and more adjustments may be needed. Treatment can take time, but sticking with it helps many children and teens have fewer bipolar symptoms.</p>.<p>You can help treatment be more effective. Try keeping a chart of your child's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/moods_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">moods</a>, behaviors, and sleep patterns. This is called a "daily life chart" or "mood chart." It can help you and your child understand and track the illness. A chart can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_help_my_child_or_teen" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Help begins with the right diagnosis and treatment.
