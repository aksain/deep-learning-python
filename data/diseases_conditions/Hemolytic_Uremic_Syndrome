</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In medicine, a syndrome is defined as a collection of symptoms (patient 
complaints), signs (findings on physical examination), and laboratory or imaging 
findings that tend to group together and be associated with a specific disease 
or illness.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_hemolytic_uremic_syndrome_hus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disease of two body systems, the blood 
stream and the kidney. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemolysis/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hemolysis</a> describes the destruction of red blood cells. In 
hemolytic uremic syndrome, blood within capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body, begins to clot abnormally. When red blood cells pass through the clogged capillaries, they are sheared apart and broken. (hemo=blood +lysis=destruction). The second failed system, kidney failure (uremia), occurs when urea and other waste products build up in the bloodstream because the 
kidneys cannot filter and dispose of them. (urea=a waste chemical + emia= in the blood). </p>.<p>HUS is also related to another disease caused by a similar normal clotting process 
within the capillaries called thrombotic 
thrombocytic purpura (TTP). Within the 
medical literature, these two conditions are often considered together. HUS is 
more widely known, however, because it has been discussed in the press because 
of its relationship to a special type of 
<i>E. Coli</i> (<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Escherichia coli</a></i>) infection 
associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">food poisoning</a>.</p>.<p>HUS can be classified as typical or atypical. The typical type is associated 
with gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. 
Atypical HUS is not associated with GI symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_hemolytic_uremic_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the cause of HUS has not been established with certainty, researchers 
believe that an abnormal inflammatory reaction is stimulated in the blood stream 
causing platelets (the parts of the blood that form clots) to sludge in small 
blood vessels and form <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> where they are not supposed to. This uses up 
the platelets and causes a shortage of them in the rest of the body. This 
abnormal reaction may be caused by a yet unidentified chemical that is produced 
in blood plasma (the fluid or non-cellular part of the bloodstream).</p>.<p>The triggering events for HUS are varied and include:</p>.<p>Only the diarrheal form of HUS is considered to be typical HUS and is usually a disease of infants and children younger than 3 years of age.</p>.<p>The others are classified as atypical HUS and also include the familial form of the disease in which a gene mutation affects the blood clotting mechanism.

vomiting and profuse bloody, watery <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>, 
as a symptom up to a week before the onset of HUS. This may cause significant 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a>, weakness and lethargy, as well as 
electrolyte imbalances because of 
the loss of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the 
vomit and diarrhea. These symptoms 
may resolve before the onset of anemia and the kidney failure symptoms of HUS.</p>.<p>The anemia and uremia usually present with weakness, lethargy, and 
sleepiness. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Seizures</a> may occur. Purpura or small areas of bleeding in the skin may be seen because of 
low platelet counts (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thrombocytopenia</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hemolytic_uremic_syndrome_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The health care professional will have a suspicion of the disease based on the 
history and physical examination, especially in a small child who has had the 
typical bloody diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory tests help confirm the 
diagnosis. These abnormal findings may include:</p>.<p>In atypical HUS, history is very important to search for other potential 
causes of the disease. Unfortunately, the case may not be found in up to half of 
cases of atypical HUS.</p>.<p>One of the distinguishing findings between HUS and TTP is a normal neurologic 
examination. The brain function is normal in HUS.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the__%09treatment_for_hemolytic_uremic_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Typical HUS in children tends to be self-limiting, and supportive care is often all 
that is needed. This may include intravenous fluids for rehydration and 
rebalancing of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrolytes</a> like sodium and potassium, which can be lost with 
the diarrhea.</p>.<p>Blood transfusions are only used for the most severe cases of anemia in which 
the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemoglobin</a> falls below 6 or 7 g/dL (depending on age, the normal value is 
11-16).</p>.<p>Kidney failure 
may be managed expectantly (by observation and supportive 
care), and dialysis is not often required.</p>.<p>Adults with atypical HUS tend to become more ill and need more aggressive therapy than 
children with the condition. In addition to the supportive care discussed above, 
plasmapheresis or plasma exchange may be required. Since it is thought there is 
an abnormal chemical in the plasma stimulating the abnormal clot formation, 
removing the plasma and replacing it with donor plasma is helpful in treating 
adult HUS.</p>.<p>Dialysis may be needed while awaiting recovery of the kidneys from 
the illness.</p>.<p>Eculizumab (Soliris) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of atypical HUS. It is a monoclonal antibody that decreases the blood clotting in the capillary blood vessels, decreasing the potential destruction of cells. This type of therapy decreases the body's immune capabilities, and the risk of infection increases.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_hemolytic_uremic_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Typical HUS in children tends to be self-limiting, and full recovery is most 
likely. </p>.<p>Adults do less well. Without aggressive therapy like plasmapheresis and 
dialysis, up to 25% of those affected with atypical HUS may die in the acute 
phase of the disease, and 50% may have developed long-term kidney impairment.</p>.<p>Patients with HUS not related to a diarrheal illness have a worse prognosis 
than those whose illness is due to gastrointestinal infection.</p>.<p>In those patients with genetically caused HUS, relapsing illness is common as 
are kidney failure requiring dialysis and death.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_hemolytic_uremic_syndrome_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most cases of typical HUS associated with diarrhea can be prevented by thorough washing 
and cooking of 
food products. The vast majority of cases of typical HUS are caused by poor food 
handling from the farmer to the wholesaler and grocer. Proper washing and 
cooking techniques in the kitchen is the key to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a>. </p>.<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent atypical HUS.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
