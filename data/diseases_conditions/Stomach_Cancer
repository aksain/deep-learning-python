It is part of the digestive system, which processes nutrients (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">vitamins</a>, minerals, carbohydrates, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat_and_fats_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">fats</a>, proteins, and water) in foods that are eaten and helps pass waste material out of the body. Food moves from the throat to the stomach through a hollow, muscular tube called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a>. After leaving the stomach, partly-digested food passes into the small intestine and then into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">large intestine</a>.</p>.<p>The wall of the stomach is made up of 3 layers of tissue: the mucosal (innermost) layer, the muscularis (middle) layer, and the serosal (outermost) layer. Gastric cancer begins in the cells lining the mucosal layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.</p>.<p>Stromal tumors of the stomach begin in supporting connective tissue and are treated differently from gastric cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="age_diet_and_stomach_disease_can_affect_the_risk_of_developing_gastric_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for gastric cancer include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="symptoms_of_gastric_cancer_include_indigestion_and_stomach_discomfort_or_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by gastric cancer or by other conditions.</p>.<p>In the early stages of gastric cancer, the following symptoms may occur:</p>.<p>In more advanced stages of gastric cancer, the following signs and symptoms may occur:</p>.<p>Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="tests_that_examine_the_stomach_and_esophagus_are_used_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_gastric_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used:</p>.<p>The sample of tissue may be checked to measure how many HER2 genes there are and how much HER2 protein is being made. If there are more HER2 genes or higher levels of HER2 protein than normal, the cancer is called HER2 positive. HER2-positive gastric cancer may be treated with a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:</p>.<p>When gastric cancer is found very early, there is a better chance of recovery. Gastric cancer is often in an advanced stage when it is diagnosed. At later stages, gastric cancer can be treated but rarely can be cured. Taking part in one of the clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered.</p>.<p><b><a name="after_gastric_cancer_has_been_diagnosed_tests_are_done_to_%0Afind_out_if_cancer_cells_have_spread_within_the_stomach_or_to_other_parts_of_the_%0Abody" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the stomach or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.</p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_three_ways_that_cancer_spreads_in_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p><b><a name="cancer_may_%0Aspread_from_where_it_began_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if gastric cancer spreads to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, the cancer cells in the liver are actually gastric cancer cells.

These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">carcinoma in situ</a>.</p>.<p>In stage I, cancer has formed in the inside lining of the mucosa (innermost layer) of the stomach wall. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, depending on where the cancer has spread.</p>.<p>Stage II gastric cancer is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, depending on where the cancer has spread.</p>.<p>Stage III gastric cancer is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC, depending on where the cancer has spread.</p>.<p>In stage IV, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="recurrent_gastric_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recurrent gastric cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the stomach or in other parts of the body such as the liver or lymph nodes.</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_gastric_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatments are available for patients with gastric cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p><b>Five types of standard treatment are used:</b></p>.<p>Surgery is a common treatment of all stages of gastric cancer. The following types of surgery may be used:</p>.<p>If the tumor is blocking the stomach but the cancer cannot be completely removed by standard surgery, the following procedures may be used:</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat gastric cancer.</p>.<p>Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Chemoradiation given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Chemoradiation given before surgery, to shrink the tumor (neoadjuvant therapy), is being studied.</p>.<p>Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of gastric cancer.</p>.<p>Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. For stage IV gastric cancer and gastric cancer that has recurred, monoclonal antibodies, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trastuzumab/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">trastuzumab</a> or ramucirumab, may be given. Trastuzumab blocks the effect of the growth factor protein HER2, which sends growth signals to gastric cancer cells. Ramucirumab blocks the effect of the protein VEGF and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="patients_may_want_to_think_about_taking_part_in_a_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p><b><a name="patients_can_enter_clinical_trials_before_during_or_after_starting_their_%0Acancer_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p><b><a name="follow-up_tests_may_be_needed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_by_stage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of stage 0 is usually surgery (total or subtotal gastrectomy).</p>.<p>Treatment of stage I gastric cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage II gastric cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage III gastric cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage IV or recurrent gastric cancer may include the following:</p>
