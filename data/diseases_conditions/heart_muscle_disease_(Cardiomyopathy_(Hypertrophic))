<p><b><a name="what_is_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with thickening of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart muscle</a>, most commonly at the septum between the ventricles, below the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aortic valve</a>. This leads to stiffening of the walls of the heart and abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aortic</a> and mitral heart valve function, both of which may impede normal blood flow out of the heart.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_hcm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
	Many people with ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have no symptoms or only minor symptoms, and live a normal life. Other people develop symptoms, which progress and worsen as heart function worsens.</p>.<p>
	Symptoms of HCM can occur at any age and may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_hcm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can run in families, but the condition may also be acquired as a part of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>. In other instances, the cause is unknown.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hcm_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>HCM is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), a physical exam, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">echocardiogram</a> results. Additional tests may include blood tests, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrocardiogram</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest X-ray</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_stress_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise stress test</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiac_catheterization/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiac catheterization</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hcm_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of HCM depends on whether there is narrowing in the path that blood takes to leave the heart (called the outflow tract); how the heart is functioning; and if arrhythmias are present. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms and complications and includes risk identification and regular follow-up, lifestyle changes, medications, and procedures as needed.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_lifestyle_changes_are_recommended_to_treat_hcm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_are_used" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Often, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> are used to treat symptoms and prevent further complications of HCM. Medications can help relax the heart and reduce the degree of obstruction so the heart can pump more efficiently. Beta-blockers and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">calcium channel blocker</a> blockers are two classes of medications that may be prescribed. If you have an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arrhythmia_irregular_heartbeat/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arrhythmia</a>, your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart rate or decrease the occurrence of arrhythmias.</p>.<p>You may be told to avoid certain medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrates-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nitrates</a>, because they lower <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/digoxin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">digoxin</a>, because it increases the force of the heart's contraction.</p>.<p>Non-obstructive HCM symptoms may be treated with medications. If heart failure occurs, treatment is aimed at controlling it through heart failure medications and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> changes.</p>.<p>Your doctor will discuss which medications are best for you.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_surgical_procedures_are_used_to_treat_hcm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgical procedures used to treat HCM include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_prevent_endocarditis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with obstructive HCM may be at increased risk for infective <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endocarditis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">endocarditis</a>, a potentially life-threatening condition.
