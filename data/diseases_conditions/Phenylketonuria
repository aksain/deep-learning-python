<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=85199" rel="bio" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD</a></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_phenylketonuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the diet. It is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. If PKU is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_phenylketonuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The occurrence of PKU varies among ethnic groups and geographic regions worldwide. In the United States, PKU occurs in 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 (newborns. Most cases of PKU are detected shortly after birth by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">newborn</a> screening, and treatment is started promptly. As a result, the severe signs and symptoms of classic PKU are rarely seen.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_genes_are_related_to_phenylketonuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mutations in the <i>PAH</i> gene cause phenylketonuria.

</p>.<p>The <i>PAH</i> gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme converts the amino acid phenylalanine to other important compounds in the body. If gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage.

</p>.<p>Classic PKU, the most severe form of the disorder, occurs when phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is severely reduced or absent. People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the <i>PAH</i> gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.

</p>.<p>Changes in other genes may influence the severity of PKU, but little is known about these additional genetic factors.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_inherit_phenylketonuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_names_do_people_use_for_phenylketonuria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
