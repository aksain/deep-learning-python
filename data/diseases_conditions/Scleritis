In episcleritis, only the superficial tissue between the white of the eye (sclera) and the blood vessel-filled covering (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctiva</a>) is inflamed.</p>.<p>Approximately one-half of scleritis cases are associated with underlying diseases that affect the body internally (systemic diseases). Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune diseases, and generalized vasculitic abnormalities may all first appear as scleritis or manifest themselves as scleritis at some other time during the course of the underlying disease.</p>.<p>Scleritis may be seen in association with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a>, other types of inflammatory arthritis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ankylosing_spondylitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reactive_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">reactive arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gouty arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriatic_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriatic arthritis</a>, relapsing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/relapsing_polychondritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">polychondritis</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polyarteritis_nodosa/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">polyarteritis nodosa</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mixed_connective_tissue_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mixed connective tissue disease</a>, progressive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scleroderma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">systemic sclerosis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scleroderma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scleroderma</a>), granulomatous polyangiitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polymyositis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">polymyositis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sjogrens_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Sjögren's syndrome</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polymyalgia_rheumatica/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">giant cell arteritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_intestinal_problems/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inflammatory bowel disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">angiitis</a>.</p>.<p>Scleritis may be the initial manifestation of these underlying illnesses.

This redness can have a bluish or violet tinge. With repeated episodes or long-standing scleritis, the sclera can thin and the underlying brown choroid may become visible through the residual sclera.</p>.<p>Scleritis may be nodular with multiple round or oval elevated areas of the sclera. Scleritis may also be necrotizing, resulting in areas of thinning and softening of the normally fairly rigid sclera.

In necrotizing scleritis, there is breakdown of the scleral tissue.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_treat_scleritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ophthalmologists treat scleritis. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Your ophthalmologist may consult with an immunologist or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatology/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatologist</a> to assist in your treatment depending on the particular situation.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_scleritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Scleritis is usually diagnosed by the history and the clinical findings on slit lamp examination by an ophthalmologist. The slit lamp is a special viewing instrument that eye specialists use to stabilize the head while magnifying and viewing the structures of the eye.</p>.<p>In order to determine the cause of the scleritis, blood tests including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_factor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">rheumatoid factor</a>, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, human leukocyte antigen typing, and erythrocyte <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sedimentation rate</a> may be ordered. If infectious disease is suspected, appropriate cultures or serological tests may be necessary. If granulomatosis with polyangiitis is considered, sinus <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> and a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a> may be ordered. Radiographic examination of joints may assist in the diagnosis of various types of arthritis. If orbital inflammation is suspected in addition to the scleritis, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> of the orbit may be helpful for diagnosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_scleritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of scleritis resulting from an underlying disease process usually requires specific therapy for that disease.</p>.<p>Topical treatment with eye drops is an adjunct to such systemic treatment. These eye drops will usually be anti-inflammatory, such as topical steroid drops or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a>). Topical antibiotics are used if the scleritis is felt to be infectious.</p>.<p>In situations where no underlying disease process is found, eye drops to counter inflammation are used, but they are often insufficient to control the process. Systemic treatment with NSAIDs, cortisone medication (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroids</a>), or immune modulating agents such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">methotrexate</a> (MTX) can be the first choice.

Scleritis may be recurrent, but is usually responsive to therapy. It is critical that any underlying disease be diagnosed and treated. Many of the conditions associated with scleritis are serious and may only be diagnosed during the evaluation for the cause of the scleritis. The scleritis itself may respond to treatment, but the underlying disease process may not.</p>.<p>In general, scleritis in association with granulomatosis with polyangiitis is difficult to treat and may lead to vision loss even with treatment. The scleritis seen with the spondyloarthropathies is usually very responsive to treatment. Scleritis that occurs in the absence of an underlying disease will typically respond well to treatment.
