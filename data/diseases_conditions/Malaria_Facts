<p><b><a name="malaria_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Malaria is a serious, sometimes fatal, disease spread by mosquitoes and caused by a parasite. Malaria was a significant health risk in the U.S. until it was eliminated by multiple programs in the late 1940s. The illness presents with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">flu-like symptoms</a> that include high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chills</a>.</p>.<p>There are three necessary aspects to the malaria life cycle:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_malaria_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Malaria is not spread from person to person (except in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> as noted below) but can be spread in certain circumstances without a mosquito. This occurs rarely and is usually found in a transmission from the mother to the unborn child (congenital malaria), by blood transfusions, or when intravenous-drug users share needles. Except for the above conditions, malaria is not considered to be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> person to person.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_incubation_period_for_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Following the mosquito bite, there is about a seven- to 30-day period before symptoms appear (incubation period). The incubation period for <i>P. vivax</i> is usually 10-17 days but can be much longer (about one year and rarely, as long as 30 years!). <i>P. falciparum</i> usually has a short incubation period (10-14 days). Other species of <i>Plasmodium</i> that cause malaria have incubation periods similar to <i>P. vivax</i>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_malaria_what_are_the_types_of_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Parasites of the genus <i>Plasmodium</i> cause malaria. Although there are many species of <i>Plasmodium</i>, only five infect humans and cause malaria.</p>.<p><i>P. falciparum</i>: found in tropical and subtropical areas; major contributor to deaths from severe malaria</p>.<p><i>P. vivax</i>: found in Asia and Latin America; has a dormant stage that can cause relapses</p>.<p><i>P. ovale</i>: found in Africa and the Pacific islands</p>.<p><i>P. malariae</i>: worldwide; can cause a chronic infection</p>.<p><i>P. knowlesi</i>: found throughout Southeast Asia; can rapidly progress from an uncomplicated case to a severe malaria infection</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_malaria_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Malaria has a wide spectrum of symptoms. After the bite by the infected mosquito occurs, it can take between seven and 30 days (average is seven to 15 days) before symptoms start (incubation period).</p>.<p>Malaria is classified as uncomplicated or complicated (severe).</p>.<p>The most common symptoms are</p>.<p>The classic description of a malaria attack (which is rarely observed), would be a six- to 12-hour period of cold and shivering alternating with fever and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headaches</a> and then a stage of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tiredness</a> (sometimes divided into the cold and hot stage).</p>.<p>As these symptoms are very nonspecific, it is important to evaluate if the patient has risk factors for malaria (usual travel in endemic areas).</p>.<p>This occurs when different body systems are affected by malaria.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_treat_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Malaria can be treated by your primary care doctor (pediatrician, family medicine, internal medicine), as well as by infectious-disease specialists.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of malaria can mimic many other diseases, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">influenza</a> or a viral syndrome. It is therefore important to inquire about a history of recent travel to an endemic area or other possible exposures.</p>.<p>The definite diagnosis is made by looking at the blood of an infected patient under the microscope (blood smear) and identifying the presence of the parasite. The patients' blood is prepared under a slide with a specific stain to help identify the parasite. This is the most widely performed and accepted test.</p>.<p>Rapid diagnostic tests (antigen tests) are available that can give the diagnosis in a few minutes. It is recommended that a positive test is followed with a blood smear examination.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Besides supportive care, the medical team needs to decide on the appropriate antibiotics to treat malaria. The choice will depend on several factors, including</p>.<p>Physicians will administer the medication in pill form or as an intravenous antibiotic depending on above factors.</p>.<p>The most commonly used medications are</p>.<p><b><a name="can_malaria_reoccur_after_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i> can hibernate in the liver and cause relapsing disease weeks or months after the patient is symptom free.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If diagnosed early and if the appropriate antibiotics are available and used, the prognosis of malaria is very good.</p>.<p>Worldwide, malaria is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. The majority of victims are young children from sub-Saharan Africa. Death is usually due to lack of available treatment or access to treatment.</p>.<p><i>P. falciparum</i> tends to be the species causing the most complications and has a high mortality if untreated.</p>.<p>Cerebral malaria, a complication of <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria, has a 20% mortality rate even if treated.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_malaria_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is currently no commercial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> available to prevent malaria. Due to the diversity of the <i>Plasmodium</i> species and the <i>P. falciparum</i> species being the most deadly parasite, most efforts are currently directed toward a <i>P. falciparum</i> vaccine. RTS,S/ASO1 is the most advanced candidate as a viable vaccine.</p>.<p>A phase 3 trial of RTS,S/ASO1 was completed and results published in 2015. The WHO is supporting the pilot implementation in several sub-Saharan countries.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_people_prevent_malaria" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prevention of malaria includes several steps.</p>.<p>First, evaluate if malaria is a concern in the area of travel (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">CDC malaria information by country table</a>). This table will also indicate which medication to take as chemo prophylaxis.</p>.<p>If chemo-prophylaxis is recommended, discuss the recommended medications with a health care professional to determine if they are appropriate. Take into consideration any medical conditions, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_interactions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drug interactions</a> with current medication taken on a continual basis, as well as side effects of the recommended medications.</p>.<p>No medication is 100% effective, and therefore the prevention of mosquito bites is of paramount importance.
