<p><b><a name="depression_in_children_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_childhood_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Clinically significant depression is being severe enough to interfere with one's ability to function. It is quite common at every age, affecting more than 16% of children in the United States at some time in their lives and thought to be increasing in children and adolescents, both in this country and elsewhere. Other statistics about depression include its tendency to occur at a rate of about 2% prior to the teenage years and at approximately 5%-8% when both adolescents and children younger than adolescence are considered. It is a leading cause of health impairment (morbidity) and death (mortality). About 3,000 adolescents and young adults die by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">suicide</a> each year in the United States, making it the third leading cause of death in people 10-24 years of age.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children may suffer from the episodes of moderate to severe depression associated with major depressive disorder, or more chronic, mild to moderate low mood of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dysthymia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dysthymia</a>. Depression may also be part of other mood disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bipolar disorder</a>, as a <span lang="en-us"></span>result of psychosis (for example, having symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/delusions/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">delusions</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">hallucinations</a>), as part of a medical condition like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypothyroidism</a>, or the result of exposure to certain medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold</a> medications or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drug abuse</a>, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cocaine_and_crack_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cocaine</a> withdrawal.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depressive disorders in children does not have one specific cause. Rather, people with these conditions tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors to its development. Biologically, depression is associated with a deficient level of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, a smaller size of some areas of the brain and increased activity in other parts of the brain. Girls are more likely to be given the diagnosis of depression than boys, but that is thought to be due to, among other things, biological differences based on gender, and differences in how girls are encouraged to interpret their experiences and respond to it as opposed to boys. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic component to the pattern of children, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a> with a depressed parent are as much as four times more likely to also develop the disorder. Children who have depression or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> are more prone to have other biological problems, like low birth weight, suffering from a physical condition, trouble sleeping, and to having a mother younger than 18 years old at the time of their birth.</p>.<p>Psychological contributors to depression include low self-esteem, negative social skills, negative <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beauty_and_body_image/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">body image</a>, being excessively self-critical, and often feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. Children who suffer from conduct disorder, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ADHD</a>), clinical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anxiety</a>, or who have cognitive or learning problems, as well as trouble engaging in social activities, also have more risk of developing depression.</p>.<p>Depression may be a reaction to life stresses, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>, including verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, the death of a loved one, school problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bullying/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bullying</a>, or suffering from peer pressure. Youth who are struggling to adapt to the United States culture have found to be at higher risk for developing depression. Research differs as to whether <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obese</a> children have an increased risk of developing depression.</p>.<p>Other contributors to this condition include poverty and financial difficulties in general, exposure to violence, social isolation, parental conflict, divorce, and other causes of disruptions to family life. Children who have limited physical activity, poor school performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for developing depression, as well.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_warning_signs_of_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Clinical depression</a>, also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">major depression</a>, is more than sadness that lasts for a day or two. In true depressive illnesses, the symptoms last weeks, months, or sometimes years if not treated. Depression often results in the sufferer being unable to perform daily activities, such as getting out of bed or getting dressed, performing well at school, or playing with peers. General symptoms of a major depressive episode, regardless of age, include having a depressed mood or irritability or difficulty experiencing pleasure for at least two weeks and having at least five of the following signs and symptoms:</p>.<p>Children with depression may also experience the classic symptoms but may exhibit other symptoms as well, including</p>.<p>Examples of risk-taking behaviors in children include unsafe play, like climbing excessively high or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">running</a> in the street.</p>.<p>Parents of infants and children with depression often report noticing the following behavior changes in the child:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_depression_in_children_what_health_care_specialists_diagnose_and_treat_childhood_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many health care providers can help determine if the diagnosis of clinical depression is appropriate in children, including licensed mental health counselors, pediatricians, other primary care providers, specialists seen for a medical problem, emergency room doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and social workers. Due to the societal stigma that can be associated with receiving mental health treatment, pediatricians and other primary care doctors are often the first professionals approached for diagnosis and treatment of depression. The practitioner consulted to assess a child for depression will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical interview and physical examination as part of assigning the correct diagnosis. Depression is associated with a number of other mental health conditions, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_children_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_children_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ADHD</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">autism</a>-spectrum disorders, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/posttraumatic_stress_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/posttraumatic_stress_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">PTSD</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">OCD</a>), and anxiety disorders, so the evaluator will likely screen for signs and symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">manic</a> depression (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_mania_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">bipolar disorder</a>), a history of trauma, and other mental health symptoms. Childhood depression also may be associated with a number of medical problems, or it can be a side effect of various medications, exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> of abuse or other toxins. Therefore, health care professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial assessment to rule out other causes of symptoms. Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study. As part of the evaluation, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help determine the risk of depression and suicide.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_parents_do_if_they_suspect_that_their_child_is_depressed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Family members and friends should seek mental health assessment and treatment for the depressed child. Adult family members may confer with the child's primary care doctor or seek mental health services by contacting one of the resources indicated below. Once the child with depression is receiving treatment, family members can promote good mental health by gently encouraging him or her to have a healthy lifestyle, including encouraging the child to maintain a healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>, including adequate water intake, get enough <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> regularly, remain socially active, and to engage in healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>-management activities. Research that analyzed the results of several studies (meta-analysis) has found that the positive impact of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> on mood is even more than assumed due to its being part of a healthy lifestyle. Parents and other loved ones can also be helpful to the depressed child by discouraging him or her from engaging in risky behaviors.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If it is determined that your child is suffering from clinical depression, the health care professional likely will recommend treatment. Treatment options may include alleviating any medical condition that causes or worsens depression. For example, a person who has low levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">thyroid hormone</a> might receive hormone replacement with levothyroxine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levothyroxine_sodium/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Synthroid</a>). Other aspects of treatment may include supportive therapy, like lifestyle and behavioral changes, psychotherapy, complementary treatments, and possibly medication for moderate to severe depression. If symptoms are severe enough that treatment with medication is appropriate, symptoms tend to improve faster and for a longer period when medication is combined with psychotherapy.</p>.<p>Most mental health professionals will continue treatment of major depression for six months to a year to prevent a reoccurrence of symptoms. Treatment for children with depression can have a significantly positive effect on the child's functioning with peers, family members, and at school. Without treatment, symptoms tend to last much longer, may not improve, or may worsen. With treatment, the chances of recovery are significantly improved.</p>.<p>Psychotherapy ("talk therapy") is a kind of mental health counseling that entails working with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with depression. It can be a powerfully effective intervention, even resulting in positive biochemical changes in the brain. For <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a>, music therapy and infant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/massage_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">massage</a> are useful interventions. Two major kinds of psychotherapy commonly treat childhood depression: interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In general, these forms of treatment take weeks to months to complete and has a goal of alleviating depressive symptoms. More intensive psychotherapy may be needed for a longer period of time when treating very severe depression or for depression that is accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms.</p>.<p>Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This form of psychotherapy seeks to alleviate depressive symptoms by helping child with depression develop more effective skills for coping with their emotions and relationships. IPT uses two strategies to achieve those goals:</p>.<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This approach to psychotherapy helps to decrease depression and the likelihood it will come back by helping the child change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to achieve these goals.</p>.<p>The most commonly used group of antidepressant medications prescribed for children is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI medications influence the levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing professionals, these medications are the first choice because of the significant degree of effectiveness and safety of this group of medicines. Examples of these medications are listed here with the generic name first and the brand name in parentheses.</p>.<p>Only Prozac and Lexapro are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat childhood depression and only in those 8 years of age and older for Prozac, 12 years old and older for Lexapro. Any other medications used to treat this condition in children or using an antidepressant in younger children is therefore considered to be being used "off label." In fact, the use of Paxil has fallen out of favor due to its lack of consistent efficacy in the context of the risk of possible side effects.</p>.<p>Although FDA approved for use in teenagers with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">schizophrenia</a> rather than for depression, atypical neuroleptic medications like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aripiprazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aripiprazole</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aripiprazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Abilify</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/risperidone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">risperidone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/risperidone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Risperdal</a>) are sometimes prescribed in addition to an antidepressant in children who either suffer from severe depression, fail to improve after receiving a trial of an antidepressant in addition to, or instead of, an antidepressant in children who have bipolar disorder.</p>.<p>Doctors sometimes prescribe non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications with an antidepressant to treat children with severe unipolar depression who do not improve after receiving trials of different <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antidepressants</a>. Physicians might consider these medications in addition to or instead of an antidepressant in children who suffer from bipolar disorder.</p>.<p>Examples of such non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valproic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">divalproex</a> sodium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valproic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Depakote</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/carbamazepine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">carbamazepine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/carbamazepine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tegretol</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lamotrigine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">lamotrigine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lamotrigine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lamictal</a>). Of the non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers, lamotrigine (Lamictal) seems to be unique in its ability to treat unipolar depression effectively by itself as well as in addition to an antidepressant. However, only people 16 years of age or older use the drug due to potentially serious side effects.</p>.<p>Other antidepressant medications work differently than the commonly used SSRIs. Physicians may prescribe the following medications when SSRIs have not worked: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bupropion/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">bupropion</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bupropion/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Wellbutrin</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/venlafaxine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">venlafaxine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/venlafaxine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Effexor</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/duloxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">duloxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/duloxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cymbalta</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/desvenlafaxine_pristiq/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">desvenlafaxine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/desvenlafaxine_pristiq/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pristiq</a>), or levomilnacipran (Fetzima).</p>.<p>About 60% of children who take antidepressant medication improve. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to start feeling better. The prescribing professional will likely assess the depressed child who is receiving the medication again soon after it is started to determine if the medication is being well tolerated and if symptoms have begun to improve. If not, the doctor or other prescriber might adjust the dose of the medication or prescribe a different one.</p>.<p>After symptoms start to improve, the prescribing health care professional will likely encourage the parents of the depressed child to continue giving the medication for six months to a year because stopping the medication too soon may result in symptoms returning or worsening. Some people need to take the medication for longer to prevent the depression from returning. Stopping treatment abruptly may cause the depression to return or for withdrawal effects (discontinuation syndrome) to occur, depending on which medication the doctor prescribes.</p>.<p>Side effects of antidepressant medications vary significantly from drug to drug and from person to person.</p>.<p>People use a number of nonprescription herbal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a> like St. John's wort and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dietary supplements</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascorbic_acid-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin C</a> and B complex <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a> as remedies for depression. There is little known about the safety, effectiveness, or appropriate doses of these remedies, despite their being taken by thousands of people around the world.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_complications_of_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depression during childhood puts sufferers at risk for developing a number of other mental health issues. Children with depression are also more likely to have poor academic performance and to engage in alcohol and other drug abuse. As adults, people who had depression during childhood and adolescence are at risk for having trouble maintaining employment, as well as family and other social disruptions during adulthood.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depression can be chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode of the disorder will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. Depressed individuals exposed to trauma are less likely to respond to treatment with antidepressant medication than those who have not experienced trauma. Young people with depression are more likely to develop severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_illness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mental illness</a> during adulthood compared to children who do not suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States for people over 5 years of age, particularly for females. Childhood depression is a risk factor for a number of potentially negative outcomes, like academic and interpersonal problems, as well as issues with drugs and attempting suicide and engaging in other forms of self-harm. Since early treatment of childhood depression improves the prognosis, improving access to care (including encouraging parents and other family members to seek mental health treatment for their child) promotes a better prognosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_depression_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For children, from infancy through the teenage years, strong, healthy parent-child attachment can help protect the child from developing depression. Parental behaviors that tend to foster health attachment with their children involve consistent love and care, as well as attentive responsiveness to the child's needs, including age-appropriate steps toward the child's gradual independence.</p>.<p>Preventing depression in childhood tends to involve addressing risk factors, both specific and nonspecific, strengthening other protective factors, and using an appropriate approach for the child's developmental level. Such programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well as family based prevention strategies because research shows that these interventions are the most effective.</p>.<p>Protective factors for adolescent depression include involving supportive adults, strong family and peer relationships, healthy coping skills, and emotional regulation. Children of a depressed parent tend to be more resilient when the child is more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their relationships, as well as being able to understand their parents' condition. For depressed parents, their children seem to be less likely to develop the disorder when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parenting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">parenting</a> and to relationships.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_families_get_information_and_support_for_childhood_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>American Association of Suicidology<br><a href="http://www.suicidology.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.suicidology.org</a><br>202-237-2280</p>.<p>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<br><a href="http://www.afsp.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.afsp.org</a></p>.<p>Jason Foundation<br><a href="http://www.jasonfoundation.com" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.jasonfoundation.com</a></p>.<p>National Alliance for the Mentally Ill<br>2101 Wilson Boulevard Suite 302<br>Arlington, VA 22201<br>HelpLine: 800-950-NAMI (6264)<br><a href="http://www.nami.org/" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.nami.org/</a></p>.<p>National Institute of Mental Health<br>866-615-6464<br><a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.nimh.nih.gov</a></p>.<p>National Suicide Prevention Hotline<br>800-SUICIDE (784-2433)<br><a href="http://www.suicide.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.suicide.org</a></p>.<p>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline<br>800-273-TALK (8255)</p>.<p>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)<br><a href="http://www.samhsa.gov" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.samhsa.gov</a></p>.<p>Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program<br><a href="http://www.yellowribbon.org/" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.yellowribbon.org/</a><span id="cntid"></span></p>
