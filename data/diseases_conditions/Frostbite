Individuals with superficial frostbite may experience the following signs and symptoms to the affected area.</p>.<p>As the degree of injury progresses to involve deeper tissue structures, the signs and symptoms of deep frostbite can develop, which may include</p>.<p>With advanced frostbite injuries, the affected area can subsequently appear blackened and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gangrene/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gangrene</a> can develop, placing the affected individual at high-risk for infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_frostbite_look_like_frostbite_pictures" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The appearance of frostbite may gradually change over time; the extent of the change depends on how severely the tissue is damaged. Figure 1 shows a hand with severe frostbite changes at the tips of the fingers and thumb (dark to black-appearing tissue) that gradually decreases in severity on the digits.</p>.<p>Figure 1. Frostbite on digits and thumb<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_type_of_injuries_can_be_caused_by_cold_weather" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Winter cold and snow provide a number of opportunities to get outside and participate in activities such as skiing, sledding, and snowmobiling. However, without proper protection, cold weather-related injuries can occur even when temperatures are above freezing (32 F, 0 C). This is especially true if there are high winds or if clothing is wet. In general, however, it is both the temperature and the duration of exposure that play a role in determining the extent and severity of cold weather-related injuries. This information describes the different types of cold weather-related injuries, as well as what to do to prevent and treat them prior to reaching a healthcare professional.</p>.<p>Cold weather-related injuries can be divided into two general categories.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothermia_extended_exposure_to_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Hypothermia</a> is a medical condition characterized by a core body temperature that is abnormally low.</p>.<p><b><a name="superficial_and_severe_frostbite_stages" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Frostbite occurs when there is freezing of body tissue, and it is the most serious of the cold weather-related injuries. Frostbite usually affects the hands, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>, nose, ears, and cheeks, though other areas of the body may also be affected. This type of injury results from decreased blood flow and heat delivery to body tissues resulting in damaging ice crystal formation, which ultimately leads to cell death. Upon rewarming of the affected tissue, vascular damage and complex cellular metabolic abnormalities lead to tissue death.</p>.<p>Damage to tissue is most pronounced when there is prolonged cold weather exposure, the affected area slowly freezes, and the subsequent rewarming process is slow. Repeated thawing and refreezing of the affected tissue is particularly damaging, and should always be avoided.</p>.<p>Frostbite injuries can be classified as either superficial or deep, depending on the tissue depth of injury.</p>.<p>Superficial frostbite injuries have a better prognosis than deep frostbite injuries.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="frostnip_signs_and_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Frostnip is a mild cold weather-related injury that typically affects the face, ears, toes, and fingers.</p>.<p>Symptoms of frostnip usually occur after exposure to cold weather. The affected area(s) may:</p>.<p>Simple rewarming restores normal color and sensation, and there is no subsequent permanent tissue damage.</p>.<p><b><a name="chilblains_signs_and_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chilblains (also known as pernio) are a common type of cold weather-related injury that can develop in predisposed individuals after exposure to nonfreezing temperatures and humid conditions. Chilblains typically develop because of an abnormal vascular response several hours after the area exposed to cold is re-warmed.</p>.<p>Chilblains are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itchy</a>, painful, reddish, or purplish areas of swelling that usually affect the fingers, toes, nose, or ears. In some individuals, blisters or small open sores may form, increasing the risk for developing an infection. Chilblains usually last for several days, and the affected area usually heals after several weeks. Though the affected area may remain sensitive to the cold in the future, there is usually no permanent damage. It is not uncommon for chilblains to recur in susceptible individuals.</p>.<p><b><a name="trench_foot_signs_and_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Trench foot also referred to as immersion foot was named after the condition suffered by many soldiers in the trenches during World War I, though it is a condition still encountered today, often in homeless individuals. Trench foot develops after a prolonged exposure to a wet, cold, environment and is typically a more serious condition than chilblains. Tight-fitting, constricting boots and footwear serve to exacerbate the condition. Trench foot does not require freezing temperatures, and can occur with temperatures of up to 60 F (15.5 C).</p>.<p>The symptoms of trench foot may include:</p>.<p>The affected foot may appear red or blotchy (red and pale areas mixed together) or even bluish-black with advanced injury.</p>.<p>As with chilblains, blisters and open sores can develop. With severe trench foot, the tissue dies and sloughs off, and the development of gangrene can occur, sometimes requiring amputation. The usual recovery period for uncomplicated trench foot can be several weeks.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="first_aid_treatment_for_frostbite_frostnip_trench_foot_and_chilblains" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The initial treatment for any cold weather-related injury involves removing yourself or others from the precipitating cold environment, if possible, to prevent further heat loss.</p>.<p>It is important to note that some of these individuals may also be suffering from hypothermia, a potentially life-threatening condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_it_take_to_recover_from_frostbite_or_frostnip" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The recovery time for a frostbite injury depends on the extent of tissue injury and whether or not there are any subsequent complications, such as infection. It may take 1 to 3 months before it is possible to determine the extent of tissue damage, and to clearly delineate which tissue is still viable. Some individuals will require debridement, skin grafting, or amputation of the affected area. Some patients will experience long-term sequelae from frostbite injuries, such as sensitivity to the cold with associated pain or burning, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a>, increased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a>, and tingling of the affected area.
