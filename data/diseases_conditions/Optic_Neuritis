<p><b><a name="optic_neuritis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_optic_neuritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Optic neuritis is an inflammation that affects the myelin lining of the optic nerve, which transmits visual stimuli to the brain. The optic nerve is actually a nerve tract of axons that originate in the ganglion cells of the retina in the back of the eye. Nerve tracts are the information pathways in the brain. The "optic nerves" are the only nerve tracts not located entirely within the brain. The optic nerves carry visual information from the retina to the area of the brain that recognizes vision (the occipital cortex).</p>.<p>Optic neuritis can occur in children or adults and may involve either one or both optic nerves. Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging from 20 to 40 years of age. There is a strong female predominance. The annual incidence is approximately 6.4/100,000.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_optic_neuritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The precise cause of optic neuritis is unknown, but most cases are thought to be a type of autoimmune disorder. The immune system is generally used by the body to fight infection by creating a reaction that combats bacteria, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a>, fungi, and other foreign proteins. In autoimmune diseases, this reaction is mistakenly directed against a normal part of the body, creating inflammation and potential damage. In the case of optic neuritis, the optic nerve becomes swollen and its function is impaired. Inflammation and destruction of the protective myelin sheath that coats and insulates the optic nerve, plus direct damage to the nerve axons results in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loss of vision</a>, which may be temporary or permanent.</p>.<p>Optic neuritis is frequently an indication of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">multiple sclerosis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">MS</a>), a disease in which the immune system attacks the myelin sheath covering nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in inflammation and nerve damage. Optic neuritis typically resolves initially but often recurs.</p>.<p>In 15%-20% of people who eventually develop multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis is their first symptom. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis following one episode of optic neuritis is approximately 50% within 15 years of any first episode of optic neuritis. Various studies have shown that approximately 50% of patients who have optic neuritis for the first time will have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) brain and/or spinal cord abnormalities consistent with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">MS</a> at the time of the initial optic neuritis.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/devics_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Neuromyelitis optica</a> is another autoimmune condition in which <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">demyelination</a> occurs both in the spinal cord and both optic nerves but often sparing the brain.

It may vary from a small area of blurring to complete <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a>. Affected individuals may also notice distorted vision, inability to distinguish certain colors (dyschromatopsia), loss of contrast, and washed-out or less vivid vision than normal. Symptoms may be worsened by heat (Uthoff's phenomenon) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>. Vision loss is usually temporary, but it may be permanent in some cases.</p>.<p>Most people who develop optic neuritis experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">eye pain</a> that is worsened by eye movement. The intensity of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> usually follows the course of the vision loss, decreasing and disappearing within one to four weeks.</p>.<p>Because optic neuritis usually affects one eye, patients may be unaware of subtle visual loss or changes in the color vision until they or doctors close or cover the healthy eye.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_signs_of_optic_neuritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most characteristic findings on examination include reduced visual acuity (typically 20/25 to 20/200), a measurable change in peripheral vision, decreased perception of brightness in the affected eye, and loss of color vision out of proportion to the loss of visual acuity. A disturbance in reaction of the pupil (afferent pupillary defect or APD) is usually detectable if the other eye is either unaffected or involved to a lesser degree.</p>.<p>The optic nerve head can easily be visualized with an ophthalmoscope. In one-third of the cases, there is visible swelling of the optic nerve head, and there may be enlargement of the blood vessels around the nerve. This condition is called papillitis. In about two-thirds of patients, the inflammation is entirely behind the eye (retrobulbar), causing no visible changes when the physician examines the optic nerve with an ophthalmoscope. This is called retrobulbar neuritis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_treat_optic_neuritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Ophthalmologists diagnose and treat optic neuritis, often in conjunction with a neurologist or family physician. A neuro-ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who subspecializes in the connections between the eye and the brain. Other specialists are involved based on any underlying diseases.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_optic_neuritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Optic neuritis is suspected based on the characteristic history of eye pain and vision loss. The standard exam includes visual acuity, pupillary reduction, visual field evaluation, color vision testing, and visualization of the optic disc by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy.</p>.<p>A person experiencing a first episode of optic neuritis should undergo an MRI of the brain to detect central nervous system lesions associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">MS</a>. If there is active brain inflammation, single or multiple <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_lesions_lesions_on_the_brain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">brain lesions</a> may be seen which light up (enhance) with injection of contrast material. The MRI may also show an enlarged optic nerve or inflamed optic nerve sheath.</p>.<p>Visual symptoms usually progress for the first few weeks and then start to improve within the first month. If the course of recovery is not typical, further testing can be performed to look for more unusual causes of optic neuritis/neuropathy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_optic_neuritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If a definite cause (such as infection or underlying other disease) is determined, appropriate therapy for that cause is instituted.</p>.<p>The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, a multicenter randomized trial with 15 years of follow-up, showed that oral corticosteroids (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a>) had no benefit on recovery to normal visual acuity.

However, about 14% will have a recurrence of optic neuritis in the affected eye, and 12% will develop optic neuritis in the other eye within 10 years.
