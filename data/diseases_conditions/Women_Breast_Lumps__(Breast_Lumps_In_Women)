Some of these causes are harmless, while others can be painful and/or dangerous. Causes of breast lumps include infections, injuries, non-cancerous growths, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a>.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Breast cancer</a> is the second leading cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a>-related deaths in women in the United States. Currently, death rates from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">breast cancer</a> are declining. The decline in death rates may be due to a combination of earlier detection and better screening as well as improved treatments. While most breast lumps are harmless (benign), every breast lump should be evaluated by a doctor to exclude or establish a diagnosis of cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Inflammation of the breast tissue is known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mastitis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">mastitis</a>. Mastitis may occur in women who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breastfeeding</a> a baby (lactating). When the skin of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nipple</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">areola</a>) is injured or cracked, which may occur with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">nursing</a>, bacteria can enter the damaged area and cause infections. In a breastfeeding woman, a hard area commonly thought of as a "clogged milk duct" can form. Sometimes, certain treatments (see below) can prevent the painful, hard area from developing into an actual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">breast infection</a>. Infections can either be a deep pocket of pus, in which the infection looks like it is growing down into the breast (an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abscess</a>), or a wider area of skin redness that spreads out (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cellulitis</a>). Body piercing in the nipple area increases the risk of breast infections, and these may be particularly difficult to treat.</p>.<p><b><a name="injuries_to_the_breast" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If a breast is injured by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>, tiny blood vessels can rupture to cause an area of localized bleeding (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hematoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hematoma</a>) that can be felt as a lump. Trauma to the breast can damage the fat cells in the breast tissue, a condition called fat necrosis. The injury can also form a lump in the breast. These types of lumps that follow a significant trauma are not cancerous. Fat necrosis can also occur at the site of a previous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breast biopsy</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="non-cancerous_growths" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_cancerous_lumps_in_the_breast_feel_like_are_they_painful" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sometimes breast cancer causes no symptoms or signs; but when they do occur, they include:</p>.<p>Breast cancer frequently causes no pain in the breast. Although women often worry about breast pain, most women with breast pain do not have breast cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_types_and_causes_of_breast_lumps_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A manual examination of the breast is an important screening method for detecting cancer, and it is the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump. Unfortunately, the manual examination of the breast is not precise. However, if a mass can be felt manually, it is important to estimate the location of the mass so that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mammogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">mammogram</a> and/or other diagnostic examinations can focus on that particular area. A doctor also inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer. Since the manual examination can miss breast cancer, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mammogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">mammography</a> is also an important screening tool.</p>.<p>Women with a breast lump need to have a mammogram of both breasts. A mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90% of breast cancers. This means that about 10% of breast cancers are missed by mammography. Therefore, if a woman or her physician feels a lump and the mammogram is normal, further studies or biopsies are carried out to rule out cancer. Sometimes, a certain pattern of calcium deposits appears on the mammogram that makes the doctor suspicious of cancer. In these cases, it is often recommended that a biopsy be taken that is guided by mammogram images to be sure the correct area is sampled.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Ultrasound</a> is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps. It can distinguish between a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cyst</a>, which is filled with fluid and a solid lump (which may or may not be cancerous). The first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a cyst or solid mass. This is best accomplished by performing an ultrasound examination. In a young woman, where a benign cyst is anticipated and, the ultrasound is confirmatory, she may not require any procedures or biopsies. If it is unclear on the ultrasound whether the lump is entirely cystic in nature, a further evaluation is usually recommended.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a>) is becoming more widely used in the evaluation of breast lumps because it is particularly sensitive to small abnormalities in breast tissue. MRI is a special radiology technique designed to image internal structures of the body using magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce the images of body structures. Cancers generally have a greater blood supply than non-cancerous growths. The images obtained from an MRI may help determine whether a particular area is cancerous as the MRI exhibits greater contrast in those areas with an increased blood supply. In most cases, MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive.</p>.<p>MRI also has limitations. For example, MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits, which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="6_treatments_for_for_breast_lumps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If the area actually looks red or fails to get better with heat, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/massage_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">massage</a>, and nursing, a doctor should be consulted for consideration of antibiotics. If untreated, mastitis can quickly progress and develop into a severe infection. Whether a woman is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> or not, she needs to see a doctor if the area does not return completely to normal with treatment in order to rule out more unusual types of infections. Cellulitis needs to be treated with antibiotics and frequent follow-ups with the doctor.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_determines_breast_cancer_risk" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The chances that a particular breast lump could be cancerous depends on many factors, including a woman's past medical history, her physical examination, and results of radiological tests (e.g. mammograms and ultrasounds). Some of the most important risk factors are outlined below.</p>.<p>Age is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer. In other words, most cases of breast cancer occur due to the fact that the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Most women with breast cancer do not have a history of breast cancer. A woman who has had a prior breast cancer or who has a family history of breast cancer is certainly at risk herself, especially if multiple family members are involved, the cases occurred at a young age, or if the cancer involved both breasts of a single family member.</p>.<p>Women who have received <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation therapy</a> to the chest area as treatment for another cancer have a significantly increased risk for breast cancer.</p>.<p>About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases have been shown to be related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> gene changes (mutations). The most common mutations are those of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">BRCA1</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">BRCA2</a> genes, although other genetic mutations may also lead to breast <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancers</a>.</p>.<p>The finding of certain conditions on previous breast biopsies can also increase the risk for developing breast cancer. Pre-cancerous growths and growths noted on a breast biopsy that represent an increased risk for the development of breast cancer include the following:</p>.<p>Women with DCIS, LCIS, atypical hyperplasia, or proliferative disease are at even higher risk of developing breast cancer if they have a history of breast cancer in the family.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_a_woman_be_certain_that_a_lump_is_not_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The only one way to be certain that a lump is not cancerous is to have a tissue sampling (biopsy). There are several ways to perform the biopsy.</p>.<p>Types of biopsy studies include:</p>.<p>To determine the correct location to sample by either method, the lump may be felt by hand (palpitated) if cannot be located. The FNA or core biopsy may be done during an ultrasound examination or mammogram. FNA of a benign cyst may remove the fluid contents of the cyst and cause the mass to disappear or markedly decrease in size.</p>
