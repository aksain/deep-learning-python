<p><b><a name="introduction_to_treating_arrhythmias_with_ablation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ablation is used to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abnormal heart rhythms</a>, or arrhythmias. The type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arrhythmia_irregular_heartbeat/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arrhythmia</a> and the presence of other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> will determine whether ablation can be performed surgically or non-surgically.</p>.<p><b>Non-surgical ablation</b>, used for many types of arrhythmias, is performed in a special lab called the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory. During this non-surgical procedure a catheter is inserted into a specific area of the heart. A special machine directs energy through the catheter to small areas of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart muscle</a> that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy "disconnects" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm. It can also be used to disconnect the electrical pathway between the upper chambers (atria) and the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.</p>.<p><b>Surgical ablation</b> procedures used for treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_fibrillation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atrial fibrillation</a> can be "minimally invasive" or traditional "open" surgery and may be combined with other surgical therapies such as bypass surgery, valve repair, or valve replacement. Surgical ablation procedures include:</p>.<p><b><a name="why_do_i_need_ablation_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors recommend ablation therapy to treat:</p>.<p>In addition to re-establishing a normal heart rhythm in people with certain arrhythmias, ablation therapy can help control the heart rate in people with rapid arrhythmias, and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> and strokes.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_should_i_prepare_for_catheter_ablation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The ablation preparation may vary, depending on whether you're having surgical or nonsurgical ablation. These are general guidelines; your doctor or nurse will give you specific instructions.</p>.<p>To prepare for ablation, there are several steps you should take.
