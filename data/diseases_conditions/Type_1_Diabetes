<p><b><a name="type_1_diabetes_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_type_1_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects blood sugar regulation. A person's immune system makes antibodies that destroy the insulin-producing islet beta cells in the pancreas. The pancreas then fails to make insulin. Without insulin, blood sugar increases and cannot be delivered to the muscles and brain where it is needed. Over time, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperglycemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high blood sugar</a> can lead to a number of complications such as kidney, nerve, and eye damage, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardiovascular disease</a>. Moreover, cells do not receive the glucose necessary for energy and normal function.</p>.<p>Because type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, cures will likely involve replacing the damaged pancreas or promoting regeneration or functioning of the pancreas. Because people with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce their own insulin, they must inject doses of insulin. They must match the amount of insulin they inject with their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>. Keeping blood sugar in a normal, healthy range (what doctors call "good glycemic control") is the key to preventing long-term complications.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_type_1_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Type 1 diabetes can be subtle or life threatening.

Over time, people with type 2 diabetes also may experience decreased insulin production in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetes, over time, the body can also develop insulin resistance; especially in people who gain a lot of weight while using insulin. This means there is some overlap in treatment and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a> for people who have had diabetes of either type for a long time.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_type_1_diabetes_a_genetic_inherited_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is a strong genetic link with type 1 diabetes. This can be tested for by looking at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. First-degree relatives are at higher risk. However, with any genetic condition, it is important to remember that gene expression changes in response to the epigenetic (nutritional) environment, and risk factors can be addressed with a health-care professional or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">nutrition</a>/functional/naturopathic practitioner knowledgeable about epigenetics.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_develop_type_1_diabetes_causes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. It is not known why the autoimmune destruction happens. However, there are some known triggers, for example:</p>.<p>The underlying cause of type 1 diabetes usually is not known.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_developing_type_1_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes include: prenatal exposures, exposures to foods and environmental toxins early in life, and geography.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_many_people_have_type_1_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people with diabetes (90%-95% of all those with the condition) have type 2 diabetes.

People with type 1 diabetes require injectable insulin because their pancreas does not produce enough on its own. There are different <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_for_diabetes_treatment_types_side_effects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">types of insulin</a> and different routes of administration. Most people with type 1 diabetes use both a long-acting insulin (sometimes called a basal insulin), and inject additional insulin before or after meals (sometimes called regular or short-acting insulin) to match the carbohydrate content of the meal. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">insulin pump</a> may also be used to optimize insulin delivery to the body's needs.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_type_1_diabetes_diet" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The basics of a type 1 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetic_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes diet</a> include making sure carbohydrate intake is matched with insulin and choosing healthy options to maximize <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">nutrition</a> in each calorie. People with type 1 diabetes will find it is easiest to match carbohydrates to insulin if they follow a low glycemic load (index) diet, so that the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar is slow and gradual. This also makes it easier to predict and match to required insulin.</p>.<p>Because weight gain can be a side effect of injecting insulin, a type 1 diabetes diet should be healthy and low in calories to help the person maintain or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">lose weight</a>.
