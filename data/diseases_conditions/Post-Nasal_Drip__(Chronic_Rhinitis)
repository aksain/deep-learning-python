Rhinitis is a very common condition. Symptoms include:</p>.<p>A significant association exists between rhinitis (allergic), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a>, and chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sinusitis</a> (inflammation of the sinuses for more than 12 weeks) in some individuals. Some evidence suggests that up to 3 of every 5 patients have multiple conditions.<p></p></p>.<p><b>Post-nasal drip</b> is mucus accumulation in the back of the nose and throat leading to, or giving the sensation of, mucus dripping downward from the back of the nose. One of the most common characteristics of chronic rhinitis is post-nasal drip. Post-nasal drip may lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_sore_throat_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chronic sore throat</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chronic cough</a>, or throat clearing. Post-nasal drip can be caused by excessive or thick mucus secretions or impairment in the normal clearance of mucus from the nose and throat.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_rhinitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rhinitis has many possible causes. Rhinitis can be either acute or chronic, and is categorized into three areas: allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, and mixed rhinitis (a combination of allergic and non-allergic).</p>.<p><b>Allergic rhinitis</b> is the most common cause of rhinitis. It is caused by environmental <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a> and is characterized by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itchy</a> or runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion.

These substances that cause allergies are called allergens, and typically include:</p>.<p>The best treatment is avoidance of these allergens, but in many cases this may be very difficult if not impossible. Some helpful suggestions include:</p>.<p><b>Avoidance of nasal irritants:</b> Nasal irritants usually do not lead to the typical immune response seen with classical allergies, but nevertheless they can mimic or make allergies worse, as in vasomotor rhinitis. Examples of these irritants include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cigarette</a> smoke, perfume, aerosol sprays, smoke, smog, and car exhaust.</p>.<p>Possible allergens may be identified by a very careful history taken by a health-care professional. Details of the patient's possible exposure to allergens or irritants at home or the workplace may give clues. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergy</a> specialist (allergy and immunologist) can perform skin tests to try to identify common environmental allergies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_can_be_used_to_treat_rhinitis_and_post-nasal_drip" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In addition to measures noted above, medications may also be used for the treatment and relief of rhinitis and post-nasal drip.</p>.<p>For allergic rhinitis and post-nasal drip many medications are used. It also is essential to attempt to avoid the offending allergic particles.</p>.<p>Intra-nasal glucocorticoids (steroid sprays applied directly into the nose) are often recommended as the first line of treatment. Steroids are potent anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic agents and may relieve most of the associated symptoms of runny and itchy nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and post-nasal drip.</p>.<p>Their use must be monitored and tapered by the prescribing physician as long-term use may have significant side effects. Examples of the nasal steroids include:</p>.<p>These are generally used once or twice daily. It is recommended to tilt the head forward during the administration to avoid from spraying the back of the throat instead of the nose.</p>.<p><b>Oral steroids</b></p>.<p>These <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylprednisolone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">methylprednisolone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylprednisolone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Medrol</a>), and hydrocortisone (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocortisone_oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Hydrocortone</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocortisone_oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cortef</a>) are highly effective in allergic patients. They are best used for short-term management of allergic problems, and a health-care professional must always monitor their use, as there are potential serious side effects when using these medications for extended periods. These are reserved only for very severe cases that do not respond to the usual treatment with nasal steroids and antihistamines.</p>.<p>Allergy medications such as antihistamines are also frequently used to allergic rhinitis and post-nasal drip. These are generally used as the second line of treatment after the nasal steroids or in combination with them. Histamines are naturally occurring chemicals released in response to an exposure to an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergen</a>, which are responsible for the congestion, sneezing, and runny nose typical of an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergic reaction</a>. Antihistamines are drugs that block the histamine reaction. These medications work best when given prior to exposure.</p>.<p>Antihistamines can be divided into two groups:</p>.<p>There is a nasal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamine</a> preparation that has been shown to be very effective in treating allergic rhinitis, called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azelastine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">azelastine</a> nasal (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azelastine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Astelin</a>).</p>.<p><b>Decongestant sprays</b></p>.<p>Examples of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/natural_cold_flu_remedies_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">decongestant</a> sprays include:</p>.<p>Decongestant sprays quickly reduce swelling of nasal tissues by shrinking the blood vessels. They improve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> and drainage over the short-term, and their use should be limited to 3 to 5 days because of the potential for rebound <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">addiction</a>. If they are used for more than a few days they can become highly addictive (rhinitis medicamentosa). Long-term use can lead to serious damage.</p>.<p><b>Oral decongestants</b></p>.<p>Oral decongestants temporarily reduce swelling of sinus and nasal tissues leading to an improvement of breathing and a decrease in obstruction. They may also stimulate the heart and raise the blood pressure and should be avoided by patients who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">high blood pressure</a>, heart irregularities, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a>, thyroid problems, or difficulty in urination. The most common decongestant is pseudoephedrine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pseudoephedrine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sudafed</a>).</p>.<p><b>Cromolyn sodium (Nasalcrom)</b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cromolyn/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cromolyn</a> sodium (Nasalcrom) is a spray helps to stabilize allergy cells (mast cells) by preventing release of allergy mediators, like histamine. They are most effective if used before the start of allergy season or prior to exposure to a known allergen.</p>.<p><b>Montelukast (Singulair)</b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/montelukast/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Montelukast</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/montelukast/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Singulair</a>) is an agent that acts similar to antihistamine, although it is involved in another pathway in allergic response. It has been shown to be less beneficial than the steroid nasal sprays, but equally as effective as some of the antihistamines. It may be useful in patients who do not wish to use nasal sprays or those who have co-existing asthma.</p>.<p><b>Ipratropium (Atrovent nasal)</b></p>.<p>Ipratropium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ipratropium_bromide_inhaler/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Atrovent</a> nasal) is used as a nasal spray and helps to control nasal drainage mediated by neural pathways. It will not treat an allergy, but it does decrease nasal drainage.</p>.<p><b>Mucus thinning agents</b></p>.<p>Mucus thinning agents are utilized to make secretions thinner and less sticky. They help to prevent pooling of secretions in the back of the nose and throat where they often cause choking. The thinner secretions pass more easily. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guaifenesin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Guaifenesin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guaifenesin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Humibid</a>, Fenesin, Organidin) is a commonly used formulation. If a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> develops or there is swelling of the salivary glands, they should be discontinued. Inadequate fluid intake will also thicken secretions. Increasing the amount of water consumed, and eliminating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">caffeine</a> from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> and the use of diuretics are also helpful.</p>.<p><b>Immunotherapy</b></p>.<p>Immunotherapy treatment has a goal of reducing a person's response to an allergen. After identification of an allergen, small amounts are given back to the sensitive patient. Over time, the patient will develop blocking antibodies to the allergen and they become less sensitive and less reactive to the substance causing allergic symptoms. The allergens are given in the form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy_shots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">allergy shots</a> or by delivery of the allergen under the tongue (sub-lingual therapy). Sublingual therapy has been more common in Europe. In either method, the goal is to interfere with the allergic response to specific allergens to which the patient is sensitive</p>.<p><b>Combinations</b></p>.<p>These drugs are made up of one or more anti-allergy medications. They are usually a combination of an antihistamine and a decongestant. Other common combinations include mucus thinning agents, anti-cough agents, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a>), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>). They help to simplify dosing and often will work either together for even more benefit or have counteracting side effects that eliminate or reduce total side effects.</p>.<p>There are some combination nasal preparations available as well to target the tissue of the nose. The combination of azelastine and fluticasone (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azelastine_hydrochloride_and_fluticasone_propionat/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Dymista</a>) combines a nasal antihistamine and steroid to help provide relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_used_to_treat_non-allergic_rhinitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of non-allergic rhinitis is similar to the treatment of allergic rhinitis.</p>.<p>Steroid nasal sprays and nasal antihistamines, for example, azelastine (Astelin) as described in more detail in the previous section, are the mainstay of therapy for non-allergic rhinitis. Combination therapy using steroid nasal spray and nasal antihistamine has been shown to be more beneficial.</p>.<p>The other therapies, such as ipratropium (Atrovent) and decongestants also may be used in patients who continue to have symptoms despite proper therapy with nasal steroids and nasal antihistamines.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_salt_water_%0Aor_nasal_irrigation_have_any_role_in_the_treatment_of_rhinitis_and_post-nasal_drip" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Irrigating the nose with salt water is a home remedy that is very useful therapy for non-allergic rhinitis, and especially beneficial for treatment and relief post-nasal drip.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nasal_irrigation_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Nasal irrigation</a> utilizing a buffered isotonic saline solution (salt water) helps to reduce swollen and congested nasal and sinus tissues. In addition, it washes out thickened nasal secretions, irritants (smog, pollens, etc.), bacteria, and crusts from the nose and sinuses. Non-prescription nasal sprays (Ocean spray, Ayr, Nasal) can be used frequently, and are very convenient to use.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_other_options_for_the_treatment_of_rhinitis_and_post-nasal_drip" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment can also be directed towards specific causes of rhinitis and post-nasal drip as outlined below.</p>.<p><b>Treatment of infection</b></p>.<p>The most common nasal infection is a viral infection known as "the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">common cold</a>." The virus causes swelling of the nasal membranes and production of thick clear mucus. Symptoms usually last several days. If "a cold" goes on for many days and is associated with yellow or green drainage, it may have become secondarily infected by bacteria. Very few patients with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">common cold</a> from a virus will go on to have acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from sinus blockage and impaired sinus function. Sinus blockage can lead to acute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sinusitis</a> (less than 4 weeks in duration) or chronic sinusitis (lasting 12 weeks with continuous symptoms), which can be characterized by nasal congestion, thick mucus, and facial or dental <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>. From 4 to 12 weeks, the symptoms are classified as subacute sinusitis or recurrent acute sinusitis.</p>.<p>Symptomatic treatment often involves <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> relief, decongestants, mucous thinning medications, saline rinses, and anti-histamine therapy.</p>.<p><b>Reflux Medications</b></p>.<p>For rhinitis that is a result of acid reflux disease, antacids (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aluminum_hydroxide_magnesium_hydroxide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Maalox</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/simethicone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Mylanta</a>) can help to neutralize acid contents, whereas other medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cimetidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">cimetidine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cimetidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tagamet</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famotidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">famotidine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famotidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pepcid</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omeprazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">omeprazole</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omeprazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Prilosec</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esomeprazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">esomeprazole</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esomeprazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Nexium</a>) can decrease stomach acid production.

This should be done only after more conservative measures have been tried and failed. Septal deviation, septal spurs, septal perforation, enlargement of the turbinates, and nasal/sinus polyps can lead to pooling of or overproduction of secretions, blockage of the normal pathways leading to chronic sinusitis, and chronic irritation. The surgery is performed by an ear-nose-throat doctor (otolaryngologist). Surgery can also enhance the delivery of nasal medications and rinses into the nasal cavities.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
