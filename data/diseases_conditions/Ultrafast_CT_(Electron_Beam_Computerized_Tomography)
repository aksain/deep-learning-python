<p><b><a name="intro" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>EBCT, also called calcium-score screening heart scan, is a test used to detect calcium deposits found in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerotic</a> plaque in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary arteries</a> of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> patients. State-of-the-art <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">computerized tomography</a> (CT) methods, such as this one, are the most effective way to detect coronary calcification from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerosis</a>, before symptoms develop. More coronary calcium means more <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_pathology_photo_essay/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary atherosclerosis</a>, suggesting a greater likelihood of significant narrowing somewhere in the coronary system and a higher risk of future <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiovascular</a> problems.</p>.<p>Your doctor uses the calcium-score screening heart scan to evaluate risk for future <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery disease</a>.</p>.<p>Because there are certain forms of coronary disease, such as "soft plaque" atherosclerosis, that escape detection during this <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>, it is important to remember that this test is not absolute in predicting your risk for a life-threatening event, such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attack</a>.</p>.<p>Your doctor may also order a coronary CT <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angiogram</a> (CTA) to look directly at the arteries of the heart. With the CTA, pictures of your coronary arteries are made.  This is regularly performed in addition to a heart CT scan now.</p>.<p><b><a name="prepare" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may continue to take any medications but should avoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> for four hours before the test. CT scanners use X-rays. For your safety, the amount of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> exposure is kept to a minimum. But, because X-rays can harm a developing fetus, this procedure is not recommended if you are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a>. Tell your technologist and your doctor if you are:</p>.<p><b><a name="expect" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During the CT scan of your heart:</p>.<p><b><a name="happens" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may continue all normal activities and eat as usual after the heart CT scan.</p>.<p>The results of the scan will be reviewed. The following information will be obtained:</p>.<p>Your heart CT scan results will be examined and reviewed by a team of cardiovascular specialists, including a cardiovascular radiologist and a preventive cardiologist. The team will evaluate the calcium score and/or your CT angiogram, along with other risk factor measurements (risk factor evaluation, blood pressure, lipid analysis), to determine your risk for future coronary artery disease and will make recommendations regarding your lifestyle, medications, or additional cardiac testing.</p>.<p>You and your primary care doctor will receive the full report outlining your risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the calcium-score screening heart scan.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="insurance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because this CT scan is a screening examination, it is not currently covered under most insurance companies and Medicare. Therefore, you will likely be responsible for all involved costs at the time of the exam. The examination cost is about $350.00 and includes all lab, technical, medical and professional interpretation charges.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
