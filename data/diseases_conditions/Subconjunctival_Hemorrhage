A subconjunctival hemorrhage is blood from a broken blood vessel that is one of the tiny blood vessels located between the conjunctiva and the underlying sclera.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_subconjunctival_hemorrhage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most subconjunctival hemorrhages are spontaneous and not linked to any specific risk factors. If the hemorrhage is not spontaneous, then the risk factors for subconjunctival hemorrhage include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> to the eye, eye surgery, the use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contact lenses</a>, the use of medication that inhibits clotting or promotes bleeding, and diseases that are characterized by decreases in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">platelet count</a> or vascular fragility. Because of the association between increasing vascular fragility and advanced age, being older also includes an increased risk of subconjunctival hemorrhage.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_subconjunctival_hemorrhage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The conjunctiva contains nerves and many small blood vessels. These blood vessels are usually barely visible but become larger and more visible if the eye is inflamed. These blood vessels are somewhat fragile and their walls break easily, resulting in a subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the conjunctiva). A subconjunctival hemorrhage appears as a bright red or dark red patch on the sclera. Most subconjunctival hemorrhages are spontaneous without an obvious cause for the bleeding. The come from normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctival</a> blood vessels. Since most subconjunctival hemorrhages are painless, a person may discover a subconjunctival hemorrhage only by looking in the mirror. Many spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhages are first noticed by another person seeing a red spot on the white of your eye. Rarely there may be an abnormally large or angulated blood vessel as the source of the hemorrhage.</p>.<p>The following can occasionally result in a spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage:</p>.<p>Subconjunctival hemorrhage can also be non-spontaneous and result from hemorrhagic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctivitis</a>, a severe eye infection, trauma to the head or eye, or after eye or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blepharoplasty__eyelid_surgery/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">eyelid surgery</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_subconjunctival_hemorrhage_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most of the time, no symptoms are associated with a subconjunctival hemorrhage other than seeing blood over the white part of the eye or "blood in the whites of the eye."</p>.<p>Call a primary care provider or ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_care/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eye care</a> and surgery) if the subconjunctival hemorrhage does not get better within two weeks or if it has happened multiple times.</p>.<p>Also, call your health care provider if you have a hemorrhage in both eyes at the same time or if the subconjunctival hemorrhage coincides with a new onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">easy bruising</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bleeding_gums/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bleeding gums</a>.</p>.<p>Go to a doctor immediately if the subconjunctival hemorrhage is associated with</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_a_subconjunctival_hemorrhage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A health care provider will take a medical history and medication history to determine what events were leading up to the subconjunctival hemorrhage and will also perform an examination.

If you are taking aspirin or an anticoagulant for a medical condition, check with your physician to determine whether the medication should be stopped or continued. Do not stop anti-coagulation medicines without physician consultation.

Recovery is usually complete, without any long-term problems, similar to a mild bruise under the skin. Like a bruise, a subconjunctival hemorrhage changes colors (often red to orange to yellow) as it heals. A skin bruise changes to various shades of green, black, and blue as it heals, because the blood is being seen through skin. Because the conjunctiva is transparent, a subconjunctival hemorrhage never has these color characteristics.</p>.<p>Very rarely, with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage in the same location in the same eye, there may be an abnormal fragile capillary within the conjunctiva that has thin walls and tends to bleed spontaneously. An ophthalmologist can identify such a condition and close this non-essential blood vessel using heat, either from a laser or a diathermy unit.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_possible_complications_of_a_subconjunctival_hemorrhage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A subconjunctival hemorrhage will not cause any complications unless it is associated with trauma to the eye or a recent history of easy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_subconjunctival_hemorrhage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage is excellent when it occurs in the absence of trauma.
