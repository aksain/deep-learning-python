flu. In past flu seasons, as many as 80 percent of adults hospitalized from flu complications had a long-term health condition; as did about 50 percent of hospitalized children.

This fact sheet provides information about treating influenza in high risk people with prescription influenza antiviral drugs. Treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_am_i_at_greater_risk_of_serious_flu_complications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your medical condition makes it more likely that you will get complications from the flu, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>. The flu also can make long-term health problems worse, even if they are well managed. People with asthma or 
chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">congestive heart failure</a> may experience worsening of these conditions. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diabetes</a> (type 1 and 2) can make the immune system less able to fight the flu.

There are prescription medications called "antiviral drugs" that can be used to treat influenza illness. Antiviral drugs fight influenza <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> in your body. They are different from antibiotics, which fight against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bacterial infections</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_i_think_i_have_the_flu" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you get the flu, antiviral drugs are a treatment option.

Your doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs to treat your flu illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="should_i_still_get_a_flu_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Antiviral drugs are not a substitute for getting a 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu_vaccination/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu vaccine</a>. While not 100% effective, a flu vaccine is the first and best way to prevent influenza.

Administration (FDA) websites.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_antiviral_drugs_be_taken_for_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting
sick. However, starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a high-risk health
condition (see list below) or is very sick from the flu. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_antiviral_drugs_are_recommended" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two antiviral drugs recommended by the CDC and approved by the FDA for flu treatment.
These are oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu®) and zanamivir (brand name Relenza®). Tamiflu® comes as a
pill or liquid, and Relenza® is an inhaled powder. (Relenza should NOT be used in anyone with breathing
problems, like asthma or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">COPD</a>, for example.) These drugs have been in use since 1999. There are no
generic flu antiviral drugs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_should_antiviral_drugs_be_taken" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To treat flu, Tamiflu® and Relenza® are usually taken for 5 days, although people hospitalized with the flu
may need the medicine for longer than 5 days.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_children_and_pregnant_women_take_antiviral_drugs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Children and pregnant women can take antiviral drugs.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_should_take_antiviral_drugs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's very important that antiviral drugs be used early to treat the flu in:</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_health_and_age_factors_that_are_known_to_increase_a_person's_risk_of_getting_serious_complications_from_the_flu" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
