Those who seem to benefit most from this type of therapy for in-stent restenosis include people at higher risk for re-stenosis, for example, those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> or long stenotic areas (long areas of narrowing).</p>.<p>Since <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_clot_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clot</a> formation is a side effect of brachytherapy for restenosis, people who have had recent heart attacks, poor heart function and blood clots may not be eligible for this treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="have" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you are at high risk for in-stent restenosis, with careful monitoring, brachytherapy may be a treatment option for you.
