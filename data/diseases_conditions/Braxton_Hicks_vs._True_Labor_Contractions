Braxton Hicks contractions usually are milder than those of real labor, and they do not occur at regular intervals.</p>.<p><a href="" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="">True labor contractions</a> occur at regular intervals and are stronger than Braxton Hicks contractions.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_braxton_hicks_vs_real_contractions_feel_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In both Braxton Hicks and real labor contractions, the lower abdominal area and/or groin seem to tighten or squeeze, and then relaxation follows.</p>.<p>Braxton Hicks contractions do not occur at regular time intervals, and they can occur at any time of day. However, many pregnant women report that they can feel Braxton Hicks contractions at night when the bladder is full, and during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> or sex. Braxton Hicks contractions may not be painful, particularly when they begin earlier in pregnancy.</p>.<p>True labor contractions during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_pain_relief_options_for_birth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">childbirth</a> usually get closer together, become stronger, and happen at intervals that become closer together. Many women often describe the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> of real labor contractions as occurring in a wave-like fashion.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_tell_the_difference_between_braxton_hicks_and_true_labor_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some pregnant women experience Braxton Hicks (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/braxton_hicks_contractions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">false labor</a>) contractions during the second trimester. When this occurs, the contractions do not come in regular intervals, and most women do not notice them. False labor contractions do not worsen over time, and do not occur closer together. They may even lessen or go away when you move or change body positions. Braxton Hicks contractions may cause an uncomfortable tightening sensation, but usually are not as painful as the real thing, or true labor contractions. Sometimes women who are experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions believe that they represent real labor and experience a “false alarm” due to these symptoms.</p>.<p>True labor or real labor contractions usually begin after the 37th week of pregnancy, except in the case of preterm or early labor. They are a sign that labor is starting, they occur at regular time intervals, and become stronger (more intense and painful), and closer together over time. Labor contractions and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> are most likely to occur close to your due date when true labor starts in preparation for birth of your baby. You also may have other signs of labor, such as your water breaking (leaking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amniocentesis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">amniotic fluid</a>), passing of the vaginal mucus plug and/or "bloody show," when the mucus plug is blood-tinged.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_do_braxton_hicks_last_how_long_do_real_labor_contractions_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Braxton Hicks contractions can vary in length, from less than 30 seconds, to up to 2 minutes or more. Labor contractions usually last from 30 to 90 seconds.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_my_doctor_doula_or_midwife_if_i_think_i_may_be_in_labor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before you are 37 weeks pregnant you should contact your care provider, obstetrician, or go to the hospital if you have labor contractions that are becoming more frequent (every 10 minutes or sooner) and painful. You should also seek medical assistance if you have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low back pain</a>, cramping, a feeling of pressure in the pelvis or lower abdomen, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vaginal bleeding</a>, or a change in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vaginal discharge</a>.</p>.<p>After the 37th week, your healthcare team will advise you when you should call them or go to the hospital. With true labor, the contractions will happen regularly and become stronger, lasting about 30 to 90 seconds and do not go away.
