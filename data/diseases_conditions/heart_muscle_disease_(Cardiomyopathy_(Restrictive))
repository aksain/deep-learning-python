<p><b><a name="what_is_restrictive_cardiomyopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Restrictive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiomyopathy_hypertrophic/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiomyopathy</a>, the rarest form of cardiomyopathy, is a condition in which the walls of the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) are abnormally rigid and lack the flexibility to expand as the ventricles fill with blood.</p>.<p>The pumping or systolic function of the ventricle may be normal but the diastolic function (the ability of the heart to fill with blood) is abnormal. Therefore, it is harder for the ventricles to fill with blood, and with time, the heart loses the ability to pump blood properly, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart failure</a>.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), physical exam, and tests: such as blood tests, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrocardiogram</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest X-ray</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">echocardiogram</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_stress_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise stress test</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiac_catheterization/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiac catheterization</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>.</p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/myocardial_biopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">myocardial biopsy</a>, or biopsy of the heart muscle, occasionally is done to determine the cause of cardiomyopathy. During a myocardial biopsy, a small tissue sample is taken from the heart and examined under a microscope to examine the cause of the symptoms.

<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_restrictive_cardiomyopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of restrictive cardiomyopathy is difficult. Treatment is usually focused on treating the cause of this condition. Doctors recommend lifestyle changes and medications to treat heart failure.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_lifestyle_changes_are_recommended_for_restrictive_cardiomyopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Lifestyle changes can help restrictive cardiomyopathy. They might include:</p>.<p><b>Diet.</b> Once you have symptoms such as shortness of breath or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, you should restrict your intake of salt (sodium) to 2,000 milligrams to 3,000 milligrams per day. Follow this <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> even when your symptoms abate.</p>.<p><b>Exercise.</b> Your doctor will tell you if you may exercise or not. While exercise is generally good for the heart, people with this form of cardiomyopathy may experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> and shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion. Therefore, experts recommend that you take frequent breaks, exercise at a time of day where you have the most energy and start slow, gradually building up strength and endurance. Heavy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_lifting/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight lifting</a> is not recommended.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_are_used_for_restrictive_cardiomyopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Often, medications are used to treat symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy and prevent further complications. To manage heart failure, some people may improve by taking a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. If symptoms occur, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/digoxin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">digoxin</a>, diuretics, and aldosterone inhibitors may be added. If you have an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arrhythmia_irregular_heartbeat/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arrhythmia</a>, your doctor may prescribe a medication to control your heart rate or lessen the occurrence of arrhythmia. Therapy may also be given to treat certain conditions, such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and hemochromatosis. Your doctor will discuss what medications are best for you.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_surgery_treat_restrictive_cardiomyopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In some cases, if the condition is severe, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_transplant/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart transplant</a> surgery may be considered for restrictive cardiomyopathy.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
