Severe hyperthermia is defined as a body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher.</p>.<p>The body normally generates heat as a result of metabolism, and is usually able to dissipate the heat by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a> of heat through the skin or by evaporation of sweat. However, in extreme heat, high humidity, or vigorous physical exertion under the sun, the body may not be able to sufficiently dissipate the heat and the body temperature rises, sometimes up to 106 F (41.1 C) or higher. Another cause of heat stroke is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a>. A dehydrated person may not be able to sweat fast enough to dissipate heat, which causes the body temperature to rise.</p>.<p>Heat stroke is not the same as a stroke. "Stroke" is the general term used to describe decreased oxygen flow to an area of the brain.</p>.<p>Those most susceptible (at risk) individuals to heat stroke include:</p>.<p>Heat stroke is sometimes classified as exertional heat stroke (EHS, which is due to overexertion in hot weather) or non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS, which occurs in climactic extremes and affects the elderly, infants, and chronically ill.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_heat_stroke_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of heat stroke can sometimes mimic those of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a> or other conditions. Sometimes a person experiences symptoms of heat exhaustion before progressing to heat strokes.</p>.<p><b>Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion include:</b></p>.<p>However, some individuals can develop symptoms of heat stroke suddenly and rapidly without warning.</p>.<p>Different people may have different symptoms and signs of heatstroke. <b>Common symptoms and signs of heat stroke include:</b></p>.<p><b><a name="can_infants_children_and_teens_suffer_from_heat_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the elderly are at greatest risk for heat stroke, infants and children are also at risk. In particular, infants or young children who are unattended in locked a car may suffer heat-related illness quickly, since the indoor temperature of a locked car can rise to dangerous levels even in moderate weather. Rarely, infants have died of heat stroke when overly bundled in their cribs. It is critically important that parents understand the medical dangers inherent in leaving children unattended in cars in addition to the obvious safety risks. Further, cars should always be kept locked when not in use so that children may not enter them and become trapped.</p>.<p>Among older children and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a>, heat stroke or heat-related illness is a risk for athletes who train in hot environmental conditions. Among reported heat-related illnesses in U.S. high school athletes, the majority of cases occur in football players during the month of August.</p>.<p><b><a name="first_aid_treatment_for_heat_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Victims of heat stroke must receive immediate treatment to avoid permanent organ damage.</b> <i><b>First and foremost, cool the victim. </b></i></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_heat_stroke_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
