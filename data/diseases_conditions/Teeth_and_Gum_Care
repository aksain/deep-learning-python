<p><b><a name="care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are four basic steps to caring for teeth and gums:</p>.<p><b><a name="tips" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Brush at least twice a day. If you can, brush after every meal. Brushing
removes 
plaque, a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. When bacteria in plaque
come into contact with food, they produce acids. These acids lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cavities</a>.
To brush:</p>.<p><b><a name="flossing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Floss once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth,
where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it can
harden into tartar, which must be removed by a dentist. To floss:</p>.<p><b><a name="eating" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eat a variety of foods but eat fewer foods that contain sugars and starches.
These foods produce the most acids in the mouth and the longer they stay in the
mouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard "sucking candies" are
especially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time.</p>.<p>Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay because most people don't
brush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth.
Avoid snacking on:</p>.<p><b><a name="checkups" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Visit your dentist at least once every six months. To maintain healthy teeth
and gums, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings.
You should also see your dentist if you have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> in your teeth or mouth or
bleeding, swollen gums.</p>.<p>You can also ask your dentist about 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_sealants/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dental sealants</a>. Sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewing
surfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usually
lasts a long time.</p>.<p>
