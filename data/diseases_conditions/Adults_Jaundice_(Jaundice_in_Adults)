<p><b><a name="jaundice_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_jaundice_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jaundice in adults is caused by various medical conditions that affect the 
normal metabolism or excretion of bilirubin. Bilirubin is mostly formed from the 
daily breakdown and destruction of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a> in the bloodstream, which 
release <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemoglobin</a> as they rupture. The heme portion of this hemoglobin molecule 
is then converted into bilirubin, which is transported in the bloodstream to the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> for further metabolism and excretion. In the liver, the bilirubin is 
conjugated (made more water soluble), and is excreted into the gallbladder 
(where it is stored) and then into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a>. In the intestines, a portion of 
the bilirubin is excreted in the feces, while some is metabolized by the 
intestinal bacteria and excreted in the urine. </p>.<p>Jaundice occurs if there is a dysfunction of the normal metabolism or 
excretion of bilirubin. This disruption in the metabolism or excretion of 
bilirubin can occur at various stages, and it is therefore useful to classify 
the different causes of jaundice based on where the dysfunction occurs. The 
causes of jaundice are generally classified as pre-hepatic (the problem arises 
before secretion to the liver), hepatic (the problem arises within the liver), and 
post-hepatic (the problem arises after bilirubin is excreted from the liver).

</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_pre-hepatic_liver_causes_of_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jaundice caused during the pre-hepatic phase is due to the excessive 
destruction (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemolysis/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemolysis</a>) of red blood cells from various conditions. This rapid 
increase in bilirubin levels in the bloodstream overwhelms the liver's capability 
to properly metabolize the bilirubin, and consequently the levels of 
unconjugated bilirubin increase. Conditions which can lead to an increase in the 
hemolysis of red blood cells include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_hepatic_liver_causes_&lt;span_lang=en-us&gt;&lt;/span&gt;of_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jaundice caused during the hepatic phase can arise from abnormalities in the 
metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This can lead to an increase in both 
unconjugated and/or conjugated bilirubin levels. Conditions with a hepatic 
cause of jaundice include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_post-hepatic_liver_causes_of_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jaundice from a post-hepatic cause arises from a disruption (an obstruction) 
in the normal drainage and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the form of bile 
from the liver into the intestine. This leads to increased levels of conjugated 
bilirubin in the bloodstream. Conditions that can cause post-hepatic jaundice 
include</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_jaundice_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As already mentioned, jaundice is not a disease, but rather a visible sign of 
an underlying disease process. Individuals with jaundice will have a yellow 
discoloration of the skin to varying degrees, and may also exhibit yellowing of 
the mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes. However, depending on the 
underlying cause of jaundice, individuals may experience different symptoms. 
Some individuals may have very few, if any, symptoms at all, while others may 
experience more severe and pronounced symptoms. Individuals with jaundice may 
experience any of the following signs and symptoms</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_jaundice_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The risk factors for developing jaundice vary based upon the underlying 
cause. Certain individuals with hereditary conditions (for example, thalassemia 
or hereditary spherocytosis) are at an increased risk of developing jaundice 
from hemolysis. Individuals who consume alcohol heavily are at an increased risk 
of developing a<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lcoholic hepatitis</a>, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis leading to 
jaundice. People who are at an increased risk of exposure to the different types 
of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viral hepatitis</a> (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis B</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis C</a>) are also at risk 
of developing jaundice at the time of infection or subsequently if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a> 
occurs or if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver cancer</a> develops later. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_exams_and_tests_diagnose_jaundice_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The presence of jaundice requires a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the cause. Initially, your health-care professional will take a detailed history of your illness and perform a physical exam, which can sometimes determine the cause of the jaundice. Initial blood testing will also be undertaken, with special attention being given to your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver function</a> tests, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">complete blood count</a> (CBC), electrolyte panel and lipase levels. Blood testing for exposure to hepatitis may also be ordered. Additional blood testing may be ordered based on the initial results. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinalysis/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinalysis</a> will likely also be ordered.</p>.<p>Depending on the results of initial blood tests, further studies may be needed to help diagnose the underlying disease process. In certain cases, imaging studies will need to be obtained in order to evaluate for any abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. These imaging studies may include 
abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">computerized tomography</a> (CT) scan, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholescintigraphy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholescintigraphy</a> (HIDA scan).</p>.<p>Occasionally, individuals will need further invasive testing to determine the cause of the jaundice. Procedures that may be ordered include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ercp/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ERCP</a>) or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_biopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver biopsy</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_jaundice_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for jaundice depends entirely on the underlying cause. Once a 
diagnosis has been established, the appropriate course of treatment can then be 
initiated. Certain patients will require hospitalization, whereas others may be 
managed as outpatients at home. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_%0A%09complications_of_jaundice_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The type of complication and the severity of complications vary with the 
underlying cause leading to jaundice. Certain individuals will not suffer any 
long-term after effects and will have a full recovery, while for others the 
appearance of jaundice will be the first indication of a life-threatening 
condition. A few of the potential complications include:</p>.<p><b><a name="can_jaundice_in_adults_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Certain conditions leading to jaundice can be prevented, whereas others may 
be less preventable. However, there are certain measures that can be taken in 
order to decrease the risk of developing jaundice. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_an_adult_with_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for individuals with jaundice depends on the underlying cause of the condition. There are certain conditions that carry an excellent prognosis with individuals making a full recovery. However, more serious causes of jaundice can sometimes be fatal despite medical or surgical intervention. The development and severity of complications will also determine an individual's prognosis, as will a patient's underlying health and comorbidities (presence of other diseases). Therefore, a case-by-case assessment by your health care professional is necessary in order to determine a more accurate prognosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
