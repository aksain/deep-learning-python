<p><b><a name="hydroxyapatite_crystal_disease_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_hydroxyapatite" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hydroxyapatite is the major component, and an essential ingredient, of normal bone and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a>.  It is hydroxyapatite that makes up bone mineral and the matrix of teeth.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_hydroxyapatite_crystals" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hydroxyapatite molecules can group together (crystallize) to form microscopic clumps, called hydroxyapatite crystals.  
</p>.<p>Tiny crystals of hydroxyapatite sometimes form in or around joints and can cause inflammation of joints and tissues around the joints, such as tendons and ligaments.  They have been described particularly as a cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rotator_cuff/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rotator cuff</a> inflammation of the shoulder.</p>.<p>The inflammation caused by hydroxyapatite crystals has been referred to as hydroxyapatite crystal disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_hydroxyapatite_crystal_disease_the_same_as_gout_or_pseudogout" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No. These conditions are similar in that they are all caused by the inflammation that results from the body's reaction to crystals. However, hydroxyapatite crystals are distinctly different from the crystals of pseudogout or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gout</a>.  While hydroxyapatite crystals can sometimes also be found in the company of the calcium pyrophosphate crystals characteristic of pseudogout, these are quite different types of crystals.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_hydroxyapatite_crystals_identified" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sometimes, hydroxyapatite crystals can be seen clumped in the fluid of a joint that has developed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arthritis</a>. The crystals are usually so small as to be invisible under a regular microscope and thus require a special (electron) microscope for identification.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hydroxyapatite_crystal_disease_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of the inflammation caused by hydroxyapatite crystals includes rest, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> application, and medications to reduce inflammation. Cortisone-related medications injected into inflamed tissues can also sometimes help decrease inflammation and thereby relieve pain.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
