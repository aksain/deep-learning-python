The secondary function of the Eustachian tube is to drain any accumulated secretions, infection, or debris from the middle ear space. Several small muscles located in the back of the throat and palate control the opening and closing of the Eustachian tube. Swallowing and yawning cause contractions of these muscles located in the back of the throat and help regulate Eustachian tube function. If it were not for the Eustachian tube, the middle ear cavity would be an isolated air pocket inside the head that would be vulnerable to every change in air pressure and lead to unhealthy middle ear space function.</p>.<p>Normally, the nasal opening of the Eustachian tube is closed, which helps prevent the inadvertent contamination of the middle ear space by the normal secretions found in the back of the nose. A dysfunctional Eustachian tube that is always open is called a "patulous" Eustachian tube. Patients with this rare condition are plagued by chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ear infections</a>. A much more common problem is a failure of the Eustachian tube to effectively regulate air pressure. Partial or complete blockage of the Eustachian tube can cause sensations of popping, clicking, and ear fullness and occasionally moderate to severe ear <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>. Such intense <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> is most frequently experienced during sudden air pressure changes during airplane travel, particularly during take-off and landing. Young children may describe the popping sensation as "a tickle in my ear" or "my ears are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>."</p>.<p>If the Eustachian tube function worsens, air pressure in the middle ear falls, and the ear feels full and sounds are perceived as muffled. Eventually, a vacuum is created which can then cause fluid to be drawn down the Eustachian tube into the middle ear space (termed serous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">otitis media</a>). If the fluid becomes infected, the common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ear infection</a> (suppurative otitis media) develops.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_eustachian_tube_dysfunction_or_blockage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eustachian tube problems and the associated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/middle_ear_infection_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">ear infections</a> are among the most common problems seen by health-care professionals. Many people have chronic problems regulating middle ear pressure. The Eustachian tube can be blocked, or obstructed, for a variety of reasons, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_eustachian_tube_dysfunction_or_blockage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with some Eustachian tube dysfunction may experience signs and symptoms, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_home_remedies_help_clear_eustachian_tube_blockage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Several maneuvers may be done to improve Eustachian tube function and thus aid in equalization of air pressure.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_medical_treatment_for_clearing_eustachian_tube_dysfunction_or_blockage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many people with Eustachian tube blockage or dysfunction that travel use a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/natural_cold_flu_remedies_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">decongestant</a> pill or nasal spray an hour prior to takeoff, and if necessary, prior to descent. The decongestant acts to shrink the membranes lining the nose and throat, allowing the ears to equalize more easily. Similarly, people experiencing chronic daily problems with Eustachian tube dysfunction can benefit by aggressive control of allergies (with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a>, decongestants, and prescription nasal sprays).</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Acid reflux</a> control may be help some people if their reflux is irritating the lining in the back of the nose and Eustachian tube opening.</p>.<p>An evaluation with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> specialist or Allergist may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of the Eustachian tube dysfunction or blockage.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_eustachian_tube_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In severe situations, a "pressure equalization tube" (PET) can be surgically placed in the eardrum, replacing the role of a functioning Eustachian tube, and thus guaranteeing equalization of middle ear pressure. This procedure is most commonly seen in young children who experience recurrent ear infections as a consequence of a poorly functioning Eustachian tube.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_changes_in_altitude_or_air_travel_affect_eustachian_tube_dysfunction_%0Aor_blockage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A rapid change in altitude, and thus air pressure is equalized across the eardrum by a normally functioning Eustachian tube. A healthy tube opens frequently and widely enough to equalize these changes in air pressure. With altitude changes during the descent of an airplane, air pressure increases as the plane lowers. The air pressure change pushes the eardrum inward (retraction). Persons with Eustachian tube blockage can develop fullness of the ear, dulled hearing, and possibly pain when this occurs. Those with poorly functioning Eustachian tubes may experience similar symptoms when riding in elevators, driving through the mountains, or diving to the bottom of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swimming/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">swimming</a> pool.
