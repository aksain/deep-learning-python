<p><b><a name="introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To treat a  cavity  your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then "fill" the area on the tooth where the decayed material once lived. 
</p>.<p>Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a> and teeth that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or  tooth grinding ).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_steps_are_involved_in_filling_a_tooth" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>First, the dentist will numb the area around the tooth with a local anesthetic. Next, a drill,  air <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abrasion</a> instrument  or  laser  will be used to remove the decayed area. The choice of instrument depends on the individual dentist's comfort level, training, and investment in the particular piece of equipment as well as location and extent of the decay.</p>.<p>Next, your dentist will probe or test the area during the decay removal process to determine if all the decay has been removed. Once the decay has been removed, your dentist will prepare the space for the filling by cleaning the cavity of bacteria and debris. If the decay is near the root, your dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve. Generally, after the filling is in, your dentist will finish and polish it.</p>.<p>Several additional steps are required for tooth-colored fillings and are as follows. After your dentist has removed the decay and cleaned the area, the tooth-colored material is applied in layers. Next, a special light that "cures" or hardens each layer is applied. When the multilayering process is completed, your dentist will shape the composite material to the desired result, trim off any excess material and polish the final restoration.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_filling_materials_are_available" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Today, several dental filling materials are available. Teeth can be filled with gold; porcelain; silver amalgam (which consists of mercury mixed with silver, tin, zinc, and copper); or tooth-colored, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> and glass materials called composite resin fillings. The location and extent of the decay, cost of filling material, patients' insurance coverage and your dentist's recommendation assist in determining the type of filling that will best address your needs.</p>.<p>In addition to tooth-colored, composite resin fillings, two other tooth-colored fillings exist--ceramics and glass ionomer.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_dental_insurance_cover_the_cost_of_composites" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most dental insurance plans cover the cost of the composites up to the price of the silver filling, then the patient must pay the difference.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_indirect_fillings" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Indirect fillings are similar to composite or tooth-colored fillings except that they are made in a dental laboratory and require two visits before being placed. Indirect fillings are considered when not enough tooth structure remains to support a filling but the tooth is not so severely damaged that it needs a  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">crown</a> .</p>.<p>During the first visit, decay or an old filling is removed. An impression is taken to record the shape of the tooth being repaired and the teeth around it. The impression is sent to a dental laboratory that will make the indirect filling. A temporary filling (described below) is placed to protect the tooth while your restoration is being made. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed, and the dentist will check the fit of the indirect restoration. Provided the fit is acceptable, it will be permanently cemented into place.</p>.<p>There are two types of indirect fillings - inlays and onlays.</p>.<p>Inlays and onlays are more durable and last much longer than traditional fillings - up to 30 years. They can be made of tooth-colored composite resin, porcelain or gold. Inlays and onlays weaken the tooth structure, but do so to a much lower extent than traditional fillings.</p>.<p>Another type of inlay and onlay - direct inlays and onlays - follow the same processes and procedures as the indirect, the difference is that direct inlays and onlays are made in the dental office and can be placed in one visit. The type of inlay or onlay used depends on how much sound tooth structure remains and consideration of any cosmetic concerns.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_a_temporary_filling_and_why_would_I_need_one" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Temporary fillings are used under the following circumstances:</p>.<p>Temporary fillings are just that; they are not meant to last. They usually fall out, fracture, or wear out within 1 month. Be sure to contact your dentist to have your temporary filling replaced with a permanent one. If you don't, your tooth could become infected or you could have other complications.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_amalgam_type_fillings_safe" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Over the past several years, concerns have been raised about silver-colored fillings, otherwise called amalgams. Because amalgams contain the toxic substance mercury, some people think that amalgams are responsible for causing a number of diseases, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a>.</p>.<p>The American Dental Association (ADA), the FDA, and numerous public health agencies say amalgams are safe, and that any link between mercury-based fillings and disease is unfounded. The causes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a> remain unknown. Additionally, there is no solid, scientific evidence to back up the claim that if a person has amalgam fillings removed, he or she will be cured of these or any other diseases.</p>.<p>As recently as March of 2002, the FDA reconfirmed the safety of amalgams. Although amalgams do contain mercury, when they are mixed with other metals, such as silver, copper, tin, and zinc, they form a stable alloy that dentists have used for more than 100 years to fill and preserve hundreds of millions of decayed teeth. The National Institutes of Health has several large-scale studies currently under way to ultimately answer many of the questions raised about silver-colored amalgams. Results of these studies are expected to be released in 2006.</p>.<p>In addition, there has been concern over the release of a small amount of mercury vapor from these fillings, but according to the ADA, there is no scientific evidence that this small amount results in adverse health effects.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_should_I_care_for_my_teeth_with_fillings" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To maintain your fillings, you should follow good oral hygiene practices - visiting your dentist regularly for cleanings, brushing with a fluoride-containing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/choosing_a_toothpaste/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">toothpaste</a>, and flossing at least once daily. If your dentist suspects that a filling might be cracked or is "leaking" (when the sides of the filling don't fit tightly against the tooth, this allows debris and saliva to seep down between the filling and the tooth, which can lead to decay), he or she will take X-rays to assess the situation. If your tooth is extremely sensitive, if you feel a sharp edge, if you notice a crack in the filling, or if a piece of the filling is missing, call your dentist for an appointment.</p>.<p>Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.<br> Edited by  Charlotte E.
