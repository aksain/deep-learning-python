<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">woman's ovulation</a>,Â typically ending with the onset of her menstrual flow. The most common mood-related symptoms are irritability, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, crying, oversensitivity, and mood swings. The most common physical symptoms are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, bloating, breast tenderness (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mastalgia</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acne</a>, and appetite changes with food cravings.</p>.<p>A more severe form of PMS, known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder_pmdd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premenstrual dysphoric disorder</a> (PMDD), also known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, occurs in a smaller number of women and leads to significant loss of function because of unusually severe symptoms. The American Psychiatric Association characterizes PMDD as a severe form of PMS in which anger, irritability, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> or tension are especially prominent.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_pms_premenstrual_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>About 90% of women experience premenstrual symptoms at some point in their lifetime. The true incidence of PMS has often been overestimated by including all women who experience any physical or emotional symptoms prior to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstruation</a>. It is estimated that clinically significant PMS (which is moderate to severe in intensity and affects a woman's functioning) occurs in 20% to 30% of women. It is generally most severe in women in their 4th decade of life. About 3% to 8% of women are believed to have the condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="pms_vs_pregnancy_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For certain women, the symptoms of PMS may be similar to those of early pregnancy, although this is highly individual. Many women do not experience symptoms in early pregnancy, while others may report breast tenderness, bloating, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, and mood swings. These symptoms can be, for some women, similar to the symptoms of PMS or similar to the changes in their body they experience prior to the menstrual period. Unfortunately for women wondering whether specific symptoms are due to PMS or early pregnancy, the only definitive answer comes with the arrival of the menstrual period or a positive pregnancy test.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_pms_premenstrual_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
PMS remains an enigma because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories have been proven, and specific treatment for PMS still largely lacks a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from the alterations in or interactions between the levels of sex hormones and  brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters.</p>.<p>
PMS does not appear to be specifically associated with any personality factors or specific personality types. Likewise, a number of studies have shown that 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psychological stress</a> is not related to the severity of PMS.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_pms_premenstrual_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
A great variety of symptoms have been attributed to PMS. Women can have PMS of varying duration and severity from cycle to cycle. The most frequent 
<b>mood-related symptoms</b> of PMS include:</p>.<p>
The most frequent <b>physical signs and symptoms of PMS</b> include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_pms_premenstrual_syndrome_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The duration of PMS varies among women. Most women experience the symptoms for a few to several days in the week prior to the onset of their menstrual period. Some women may have symptoms for a shorter or longer time period, but symptoms of PMS typically start after ovulation (the mid-point in the monthly menstrual cycle).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_pms_premenstrual_syndrome_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most helpful diagnostic tool is the menstrual diary, which documents physical and emotional symptoms over months. If the changes occur consistently around ovulation (mid-menstrual cycle) and persist until the menstrual flow begins, then PMS is probably the accurate diagnosis. Keeping a menstrual diary not only helps the health-care professional to make the diagnosis, but also promotes a better understanding by the patient of her own body and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/moods_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">moods</a>. Once the diagnosis of PMS is made and understood, the patient can better cope with the symptoms.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of PMS can be difficult because many medical and psychological conditions can mimic or worsen symptoms of PMS. There are no blood or laboratory tests to determine if a woman has PMS. When laboratory tests are performed, they are used to exclude other conditions that can mimic PMS.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_%0Amimic_pms_%0Apremenstrual_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Some examples of medical conditions that can mimic PMS include:</p>.<p>
The hallmark of the diagnosis of PMS is that symptom-free interval after the menstrual flow and prior to the next ovulation. If there is no such interval and the symptoms persist throughout the cycle, then PMS may not be the proper diagnosis. PMS can still be present and aggravate symptoms related to the other conditions, but it cannot be the sole cause of constant or non-cyclic symptoms. Blood or other tests may be ordered to help rule out other potential causes of symptoms.</p>.<p>
Another way to help make the diagnosis of PMS is to prescribe drugs that stop all ovarian function. If these medications produce relief of the troublesome symptoms, then PMS is most likely the diagnosis.

Various treatment approaches have been used to treat this condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women. Other treatments with a sound scientific basis may not help all patients.</p>.<p>General management includes a healthy lifestyle including:</p>.<p>All of the above have been recommended and may help symptoms in some women. Furthermore, some studies suggest that calcium and magnesium <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a> may provide some benefit.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_or_herbal_remedies_help_pms_premenstrual_syndrome_%0Asymptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The fruit of the chasteberry tree (Vitex agnus castus) was shown in limited studies to relieve some of the symptoms of PMS. However, further studies are needed to clarify this association and to determine the value of chasteberry fruit as a potential therapy for PMS. Since herbal preparations are not regulated by the US FDA, caution is warranted when taking this or any kind of over-the-counter supplement. While <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/evening_primrose_oil-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">evening primrose oil</a> and gingko biloba are plant extracts that have been promoted by some as remedies for PMS, there is no evidence that these products are effective, and they are not recommended.</p>.<p>Vitamin supplementation with calcium, magnesium have been shown in some trials to help alleviate symptoms of PMS, and may have some benefit. Taking calcium and magnesium supplements may help some women. It is always important to recommend guidelines when taking vitamin supplements, since taking excess of some supplements may be harmful.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_are_used_to_treat_pms_%0Apremenstrual_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A variety of medications are used to treat the different symptoms of PMS. Medications include diuretics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, antidepressants, and drugs that suppress ovarian function.</p>.<p>It is important to know that these drugs, although useful in treating mood disturbances in some women, are not necessarily effective in treating the physical symptoms. Often, it is a combination of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, medications and exercise that is needed to afford the maximum improvement from the many symptoms of PMS.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_exercise_help_relieve_some_of_the_symptoms_of_pms_%0Apremenstrual_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Evidence suggests that exercise can help relieve some of the symptoms of PMS in adolescents young women. Physical activity improves general health and helps relieve nervous tension and anxiety. Exercise is believed to release endorphins. Endorphins contribute to euphoric feelings such as the "runner's high" experienced after prolonged exercise. Endorphins are chemical messengers for nerves (neurotransmitters) that affect mood, perception of pain, memory retention and learning.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aerobic_exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Aerobic exercise</a> strengthens the heart and improves overall <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_activity/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fitness</a> by increasing the body's ability to use oxygen. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swimming/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Swimming</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a>, and dancing are "low-impact" aerobic activities.

Although there is no "cure" for PMS at this time, there are many options for managing its signs and symptoms. The first priority is an accurate diagnosis. Other medical or psychological conditions should be identified and treated. Proper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, exercise, and lifestyle changes can improve overall health and thereby lead to the reduction of symptoms. If these measures are not effective, over-the-counter or prescription medications may be indicated. Most women can control their PMS symptoms successfully and continue to lead healthy and productive lives.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
