Milk containing the sugar lactose is a main source of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nutrition</a> for infants and young children. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is digested (broken down into two smaller sugars) and absorbed in the small intestine so that none reaches the colon. </p>.<p>On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> and also produce <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gas</a>. Some of the chemicals produced by bacteria include lactic and other acids that turn the stool acidic. </p>.<p>Individuals with intolerance to lactose cannot drink regular cow's milk without developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>, gas, and often <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>.

With normal tolerance to lactose, all of the lactose is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In individuals who are lactose intolerant, some or all of the lactose is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon. Through the action of the colonic bacteria, the stool becomes acidic. The acidity of stools that are passed after ingestion of the lactose then is measured. If the stool becomes acidic, the individual is intolerant of lactose.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_testing_for_lactose_intolerance_differ_in_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactose_tolerance_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lactose tolerance test</a> or the lactose <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrogen_breath_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hydrogen breath test</a>. </p>
