This article will concentrate on nongenital herpes. Many people acquire the virus and have no symptoms or signs. For others, painful fluid-filled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a> appear near the area where the virus entered the body. Typically, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blisters</a> heal completely but may reappear at some point in the future. In between attacks, the virus resides deep in the roots of the nerves of the involved area. When herpes simplex flare-ups appear in their most common location, around the mouth, chin, and upper lip, people often refer to them as "cold sores" or "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/cold_sores_fever_blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">fever blisters</a>." Oral herpes may cause ulcers, fluid-filled blisters, or sores anywhere inside the mouth, including the gums and the tongue. It may also cause sores inside the nose and around the nostrils. Herpes may also affect the eye.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two types of HSV, type 1 and type 2.</p>.<p>However, both types of HSV are capable of infecting the skin at any location on the body. Thus, the virus that usually causes oral herpes (HSV-1) can cause genital herpes as well as herpes on the hands and eye. The virus that causes genital herpes (HSV-2) can also cause oral herpes, although it almost exclusively infects the genital area.</p>.<p>Herpes infections, no matter where they occur first, have a tendency to recur in more or less the same place. Such recurrences may happen often (for example, several times per year) or only occasionally. You would know that you have herpes if you have an outbreak or if a doctor performs a blood test to tell if you have been infected with it. Most adults have been infected with oral or genital herpes and never know it.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_herpes_simplex_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Exposure to someone with cold sores increases the risk of getting oral herpes. HSV is most <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> when the person has <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/canker_sores/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mouth sores</a> or blisters on the lips. The virus can also shed from saliva when there are no visible lesions. This is called "asymptomatic shedding." Therefore, a person can be contagious without having an outbreak. Direct contact with the virus, from kissing or sharing personal items, will increase the chance of getting infected with HSV. Abnormal areas of skin such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a> may be especially prone to herpes infection.</p>.<p>Health care workers, such as dentists, dental hygienists, and respiratory therapists, are at risk of developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/herpetic_whitlow_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">herpetic whitlow</a> because of contact with people's mouths.</p>.<p>Medical conditions or treatments that weaken a person's immune system can increase the risk of severe complications from the virus. These include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a>, and steroids.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_makes_herpes_cold_sores_recur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After infection, the virus enters the nerve cells and travels up the nerve until it comes to a place called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ganglion/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ganglion</a>. There, it resides quietly in a stage that is referred to as "dormant" or "latent." At times, the virus can become active and start replicating again and travel down the nerve to the skin, causing sore outbreaks. The exact mechanism behind this is not clear, but it is known that some conditions seem to trigger recurrences, including</p>.<p><b><a name="are_cold_sores_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Oral herpes is contagious to others who do not have it.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_cold_sores_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The virus is spread from person to person by kissing, by close contact with herpes lesions, or from saliva even when sores are not present. Infected saliva is a common means of virus transmission. The contagious period is highest when people have active blisters or moist sores. Once the blisters have dried and crusted over (within a few days), the risk of contagion is significantly lessened. HSV can also be spread through personal items that are contaminated with the virus, such as lipstick, utensils, and razors. Despite popular myth, catching herpes (cold sores) from surfaces, towels, or washcloths is a very low risk, since the virus does not usually survive long on dry surfaces.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_incubation_period_for_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The time between infection and symptoms of primary oral herpes is anywhere from two days to two weeks.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_primary_oral_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary herpes refers to the initial outbreak of symptoms after infection, often presenting with painful sores on the lips, gums, and mouth.</p>.<p>In some people, primary herpes is associated with fever, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">swollen lymph nodes</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bleeding_gums/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bleeding gums</a>, together with painful ulcers around the mouth (gingivostomatitis) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sore throat</a>. These signs and symptoms may last several days. Difficulty in eating and drinking may lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a>. The sores heal completely in two to six weeks, usually without scarring. Virus can be recovered from the saliva for days after the lesions heal. Primary herpes usually occurs during childhood.</p>.<p>Not everyone has a severe primary attack when they are first infected with herpes. In most people, the virus infects the body without causing any symptoms. The process generates an antibody response, causing the immune system to produce antibodies against the herpes virus. This antibody response helps reduce recurrences and keep them mild. Antibodies also make it harder for the virus to get a foothold somewhere else in the body. However, it is possible to transfer the herpes virus to other parts of the body (autoinoculation).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_recurrent_herpes_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recurrent herpes occurs in the area where it first appeared, though most of the time, there are fewer blisters or a milder outbreak than the first time. Although the face is the most common site of infection, other areas of the body may be involved:</p>.<p>In recurrent herpes, it often takes seven to 10 days before the ulcers completely disappear and the skin returns to normal.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The hallmark symptom of herpes is tingling or a burning sensation before the appearance of the outbreak. The classic sign of herpes is a cluster of blisters on a base of red skin. The blisters look like a drop of water filled with clear liquid. These blisters dry up rapidly and leave a crust or scab that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the severity of the infection. This pattern has important implications for the many people who fear they have herpes but don't, If you are healthy and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> lasts for weeks, it is unlikely to be herpes.</p>.<p>Herpes infections feel dry and crusty, and they may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itch</a>. Some patients have a "prodrome," which is the occurrence of certain symptoms before the actual sores become fully evident. The prodrome to herpes infections typically involves a burning or tingling sensation that precedes the appearance of blisters by a few hours or a day or two.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_conditions_can_look_like_oral_herpes_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many conditions that can be confused with herpes, including</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_angular_stomatitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Angular stomatitis refers to inflammation, cracking, or irritation at the corners of the mouth. In contrast, herpes infections usually appear on the upper or lower lip margins, not in the corners. Angular stomatitis may be an initial sign of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a> or vitamin deficiency. It can also occur in people who wear <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dentures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dentures</a>, whose saliva can accumulate and lead to the overgrowth of yeast.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_canker_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/cold_sore_and_canker_sore_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Canker sores</a>, or aphthous ulcers, are ulcerations that occur inside the mouth along the mucosa. They are found on the inner cheeks and lower lip as well as on the tongue, palate, and the gums. Canker sores are round and very painful. They are gray in color with a distinct edge. They are not contagious and are caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a> or trauma to the area. They are not related to herpes, although they be may confused with oral ulcers caused by herpes.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_treat_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most pediatricians and primary care providers are very familiar with cold sores and their treatment. Most cases do not need the services of a dermatologist (skin specialist). An infectious-disease specialist is often consulted in complicated cases, such as herpes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalitis</a> or herpes in a person with a weak immune system. The care of an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) is important in managing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ocular</a> herpes, or herpes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/keratitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">keratitis</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_do_health_care_professionals_use_to_diagnose_oral_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of herpes (cold sores) is easily made based on the visual appearance of the lesions, and the best approach is to see a doctor at the first sign of a blister. If there is concern that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a> may not be herpes, a swab of blister fluid may be collected for viral culture or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">polymerase chain reaction</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a>) test. This is most useful in the first 48 hours before the blister has crusted over. If lesions resolve, then cultures are of no help, because there's nothing left to culture. Culture results take a minimum of three to five days.</p>.<p>PCR testing detects herpes DNA, but it is not as readily available as culture and is a very expensive test to do for simple cold sores.</p>.<p>Blood tests for herpes antibodies are not usually needed, since finding antibodies to herpes just means that the body has been exposed to this virus at some point in the past. It does not determine if the current lesion is due to herpes. They can be done, though, if the diagnosis is unclear or there is a specific reason to know for certain.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_do_cold_sores_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In primary herpes, the healing process usually takes two to three weeks, but skin pain can last for one to six weeks.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_cold_sores_are_there_any_home_remedies_and_what_medications_treat_oral_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Currently, there is no cure or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> for herpes simplex virus. Avoiding risk factors, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/sunburn_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">sunburn</a> and stress, can help prevent additional outbreaks. Cold sores will usually heal within two weeks without treatment. However, there are established cold sore treatments available to help decrease healing time, reduce pain, and in specific cases, suppress the recurrence of the virus.</p>.<p>Treatment for the first outbreak of oral herpes in an otherwise healthy person may include the following medications:</p>.<p>Treatment doses for recurrent oral herpes are as follows:</p>.<p>Suppressive treatment for those with frequent outbreaks may be given for 12 months, but it may be extended if needed:</p>.<p>Other treatment options such as lemon balm, L-lysine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">supplements</a>, citrus bioflavonoids, <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactobacillus_acidophilus-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lactobacillus acidophilus</a></i> and <i>bulgaricus</i>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascorbic_acid-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin C</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_e-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin E</a> oil, and vitamin B12 have also been considered in the potential treatment of herpes simplex virus, but there is no good clinical evidence to support these treatments. Lemon balm may have some anti-herpes properties, but it is impossible to tell if it is effective in affected people from the few laboratory experiments that have been published. L-lysine similarly has limited laboratory data suggesting antiviral properties and has been touted for reducing recurrence of herpes. Unfortunately, results in patients with cold sores have been highly variable; and there are no high quality studies suggesting benefit.</p>.<p>Treatment for children is similar to that in adults (other than being dosed by weight), except that famciclovir does not have an approved pediatric dose.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_possible_complications_of_oral_%0Aherpes_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>"Autoinoculation" from touching a cold sore on the lip can cause herpes of the finger (herpetic whitlow). Autoinoculation occurs most commonly at the time of primary infection, when viral shedding is high and the immune system is still gearing up to contain it. The antibodies that are made after primary infection are usually -- but not always -- successful in preventing autoinoculation during recurrent attacks.</p>.<p>A more serious complication is infection of the eye, or ocular herpes (herpetic keratitis). It may be a mild surface ulceration with little discomfort, or it may cause deeper, painful ulcers that threaten vision. Ocular herpes is also caused by autoinoculation. If not treated, ocular herpes may lead to serious damage or even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a>.</p>.<p>Rarely, herpes simplex may infect the brain, causing encephalitis. This infection requires hospitalization and intravenous antiviral medications. HSV-1 is among the commonest causes of fatal viral encephalitis worldwide.</p>.<p>In immunocompromised people, such as those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV</a> infection or those receiving chemotherapy, severe outbreaks of herpes may occur. Colds sores may spread to large parts of the lower face or invade organs. Antiviral drugs are used to prevent or lessen such attacks.</p>.<p>In a few people, outbreaks of herpes will be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erythema_nodosum/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">erythema nodosum</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/erythema_nodosum_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Erythema nodosum</a> is an inflammatory skin reaction characterized by red and painful skin lumps that usually appear on the front side of the legs. This condition can be caused by many inflammatory and infectious diseases, including herpes virus infections. Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in three to six weeks. Treatment of the herpes episode usually hastens the resolution of erythema nodosum.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_oral_herpes_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cold sores, if they recur, are most likely to do so during the first year after infection. They usually resolve on their own within one to two weeks. After the initial outbreak, cold sores may never appear again, or appear only when something triggers them. Usually people with cold sores lead normal lives and are not terribly affected by them unless they happen to recur very often (several times a year or more).</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_cold_sores" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best way to prevent a herpes simplex infection is to avoid physical contact with someone else's cold sores. Items that touch the lips but cannot be washed or sanitized, such as lipstick or lip balm, should not be shared. During an outbreak, frequent hand washing and sanitizing with 60% ethanol-based hand sanitizer will help reduce the spread of the virus to other parts of the body or to other people. Wash hands immediately after applying topical treatments to a cold sore. L-lysine and other supplements have not been shown to consistently reduce outbreaks.</p>.<p>To prevent future outbreaks,</p>
