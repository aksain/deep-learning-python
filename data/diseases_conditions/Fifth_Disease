Health care professionals first described fifth disease in 1896 and named the illness fifth disease because of its fifth position in the numerical classification of six <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health_illnesses_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">childhood illnesses</a> associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rashes</a> (exanthems). Other numbered viral exanthems included <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">measles</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rubeola</a> or first disease), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rubella</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">German measles</a> or third disease), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/roseola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">roseola</a> infantum (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/roseola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sixth disease</a>). The bacterium <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/streptococcal_infections/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Streptococcus</a> pyogenes</i> causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scarlet_fever_scarlatina/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scarlet fever</a>, or "second disease." Doctors no longer classify fourth disease as a clinical entity. Health care professionals did not rename these illnesses until the molecular era, when it became possible to isolate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a> and bacteria. Fifth disease is a very common infection. Almost 50% of adults have had a parvovirus B19 infection but often do not remember having it because this infection frequently does not cause symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_fifth_disease_symptoms_and_signs_in_children_and_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Fifth disease generally occurs in children between 4-10 years of age, but it can affect any age group. Fifth disease most commonly occurs during the winter and spring. The illness classically begins with a low-grade <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/runny_nose/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">runny nose</a>, and malaise (a sense of not feeling well). Of course, these symptoms mimic any other viral illness, so it is impossible to determine the cause early in the illness. After about a week, a characteristic bright red rash on the cheeks (the so-called "slapped cheeks") follows the initial symptoms. Finally, after three to four days, a fine, red, lacelike rash can develop over the rest of the body. This rash may last for five to seven days and occasionally comes and goes for up to three weeks. The other symptoms are usually gone by the time the rash appears. Patients with the rash are usually not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a>. Unfortunately, as with many other viral illnesses, the features and timing of the different stages of illness are often unpredictable.</p>.<p>Unlike other viral infections that usually cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hand-foot-and-mouth_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hand, foot, and mouth disease</a> (namely coxsackievirus A16 and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enterovirus_non-polio_enterovirus_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enterovirus</a> 71), fifth disease does not typically involve the palms and soles. However, some adults infected with parvovirus B19 can develop redness and swelling of hands and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_other_symptoms_that_can_occur_with_fifth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Around 5% of children and about half of adults with fifth disease experience joint aches and pains. This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a> or arthropathy is more common in females than males, is usually temporary, lasts days to weeks, and may become a long-term problem for months. People with arthritis from fifth disease usually have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_stiffness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stiffness</a> in the morning, with redness and swelling of the same joints on both sides of the body ("symmetrical" arthritis). The joints most commonly involved are the knees, fingers, and wrists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_serious_complications_of_fifth_disease_is_infection_with_fifth_disease_dangerous_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rarely, these patients develop erythrocyte aplasia, meaning the bone marrow stops forming a normal number of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red blood cells</a>. This complication is rare and usually transient, but can be fatal. Patients who are immunocompromised (by disease or treatment) are at high risk of this complication.</p>.<p>Pregnant women (who have not previously had the illness) should avoid contact with patients who have fifth disease. The fifth disease virus can infect the fetus prior to birth. Although no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">birth defects</a> have been reported because of fifth disease, for 2%-10% of B19-infected pregnant women, fifth disease can cause severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a> and even the death of the unborn fetus (by hydrops fetalis). Testing for parvovirus B19 is not routinely included in preconception or antenatal screenings.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_fifth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The only available treatment is supportive. Fluids, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>), and rest provide relief. Antibiotics are useless against fifth disease, because it is a viral illness. People with persistent arthritis can use anti-inflammatory medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">naproxen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aleve</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_fifth_disease_spread_when_is_the_contagious_stage_and_should_i_be_isolatedif_i_have_fifth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Parvovirus B19 usually spreads by droplets. The virus spreads whenever an infected person <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughs</a> or sneezes. However, once the rash is present, that person is usually no longer contagious and need not be isolated.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_the_spread_of_fifth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Similar to most viral illnesses, the best way to prevent the spread of the disease is by proper hand washing, by covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>, and by staying home when you become sick.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
