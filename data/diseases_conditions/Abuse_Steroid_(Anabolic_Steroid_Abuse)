<p><b><a name="anabolic_steroid_abuse_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_anabolic_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anabolic steroids are one type of performance-enhancing drug or medication. They mimic testosterone in the body to enhance performance by making muscle cells larger and by allowing the body to recover more quickly from the stress of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>. Slang for anabolic steroids is <i>roids</i>.</p>.<p>Performance-enhancing drugs are no longer just for bodybuilders or pro athletes who are willing to try illegal and potentially dangerous means to improve their body's function. These drugs are being used every day by people of all ages, from middle-school, high-school, and college students to older recreational athletes.</p>.<p>There are two types of steroids that the body naturally produces:</p>.<p><b>Catabolic steroids</b> or glucocorticoids are part of the body's response to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a>. The word <i>catabolic</i> comes from the Greek word meaning to "throw down," and these steroids help break down large chemicals into smaller ones. For example, cortisol helps glycogen (a large molecule that is stored in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>) metabolize into glucose, a small molecule that can be used for energy by the body. The adrenal glands naturally manufacture cortisol, and it is required for many of the basic functions of the body, including glucose metabolism, the immune response to infection, and protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Prescription medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Deltasone</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Liquid Pred</a>), hydrocortisone (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocortisone_valerate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Westcort</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dexamethasone-decadron-dexpak/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dexamethasone</a> (Decadron [discontinued], DexPak), are examples of steroids that are used to reduce inflammation and treat a range of illnesses from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">COPD</a> to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic</a> reactions.

Anabolic refers to the properties of these drugs to increase production of proteins that act as building blocks for muscle cells, bone, and other tissues within the body. The androgenic response (andro=male + genic=formation) describes the increased male features (secondary sexual characteristics) that occur as a result of androgenic steroids, including facial, body, and pubic hair, deepened voice, and increased sex drive or libido.</p>.<p>There are medical indications for prescribing these medications. Some include the following:</p>.<p>Some physicians believe that the decreased testosterone levels that occurs normally with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> is an indication for replacement therapy with anabolic steroids, but their use in otherwise healthy older patients is still controversial because of the potential serious side effects.</p>.<p>Chemists have manufactured many different types of anabolic steroids over the past decades. The goal of chemists is to promote the anabolic effect of the drug while decreasing the androgenic side effects that can be life-threatening. Examples of anabolic steroids include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="why_do_people_abuse_anabolic_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People abuse steroids for a variety of reasons, but most do it to increase body performance and appearance. There may be peer pressure to use anabolic steroids in some sports because of a fear that normal training will not be enough to succeed. There is also the perception that other athletes are abusing steroids and gaining an unfair advantage.</p>.<p>People who use steroids to enhance their appearance by increasing muscle and decreasing fat may suffer from muscle dysmorphia or abnormal perception of their own body. Males may think that they are perpetually too small and weak, and females may think themselves fat, even though that perception may not be actually true.</p>.<p>Bodybuilders and weight lifters are not the only athletes to think that anabolic steroid use is their road to success. Athletes, from strength sports like football and throwing the discus to speed sports like track sprinters and speed skaters, have attempted to use steroids to enhance performance and increase the efficiency of their training.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_abuse_anabolic_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Though most anabolic steroids need to be injected into the body to be effective, some may be taken by mouth and others used as a cream or gel and applied to the skin. The user will try to take enough anabolic steroid to increase the ability to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> and allow muscles to grow while minimizing the risk of side effects and the potential of being caught. Usually people take steroids in cycles with regular injections followed by periods of rest. Numerous books and web sites discuss the benefits and risks of different techniques to maximize the effect of a variety of steroids on the body. There is a large underground illegal industry that has grown to meet the demand for anabolic steroids and provides methods to try to avoid detection.</p>.<p>Cycling, stacking, and pyramiding are three common ways that anabolic steroid abusers take their drugs. Cycling refers to taking a steroid for a period, stopping for the body to rest, and then restarting again. If people use more than one type of steroid at a time, this is called stacking. There is the belief that using two or more steroids at a time increases the effectiveness of each. Pyramiding combines the cycling and stacking. One or more steroids are begun in a low dose and the dose gradually increased until halfway through the cycle where the amount is maximized and it is then tapered to zero by the end of the cycle.</p>.<p>Tailor exercise programs so that more can be done as the effect of the steroid increases. The cycles of steroid use are usually six to 12 weeks long, followed by a rest period.</p>.<p>In athletes who use anabolic steroids, a cat and mouse game exists. They try to time their steroid injections so that the drug is out of their system during drug testing. Sometimes people take masking drugs to try to "beat" the test by making the test negative. Chemists continually develop designer steroids to again prevent their use from being detected.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_anabolic_steroids_addictive_what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_anabolic_steroid_abuse" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Like alcohol or street drugs, the common signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">addiction</a> may develop with the use of steroids. These include drug cravings, requiring more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal symptoms if someone stops the drug. The following is a statement from the National Institute of Drug Abuse concerning anabolic steroids:</p>.<p>"An undetermined percentage of steroid abusers may become addicted to the drugs, as evidenced by their continued abuse despite physical problems and negative effects on social relations. Also, steroid abusers typically spend large amounts of time and money obtaining the drugs, which is another indication that they may be addicted. Individuals who abuse steroids can experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking steroids, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">mood swings</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, restlessness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loss of appetite</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">insomnia</a>, reduced sex drive, and steroid cravings. The most dangerous of the withdrawal symptoms is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">depression</a>, because it sometimes leads to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">suicide</a> attempts. If left untreated, some depressive symptoms associated with anabolic steroid withdrawal have been known to persist for a year or more after the abuser stops taking the drugs."<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_psychological_and_physical_side_effects_of_anabolic_steroid_abuse" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anabolic steroids are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase the ability to do work and exercise by abnormally stimulating muscle growth, power, and aerobic capacity. This increased function comes with a cost of potentially life-threatening side effects.</p>.<p>The complications of anabolic steroid abuse are a result of excess testosterone affecting almost all the organ systems in the body. Some of the effects are reversible and decrease when the drug abuse stops while others are permanent and irreversible.</p>.<p>In males, the excess steroid suppresses the normal testosterone production in the body. This can lead to shrunken testicles and decreased sperm count, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">baldness</a>, and breast development (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gynecomastia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gynecomastia</a>).</p>.<p>In females, anabolic steroid abuse can lead to masculinization with loss of body fat and breast size, swelling of the clitoris (which may be permanent and not resolve, even though a woman stops using steroids), deepening of the voice, and the development of facial and body hair.</p>.<p>Life-threatening side effects include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>, the risk of forming <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">deep vein thrombosis</a> and pulmonary embolus), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver cancer</a>, and liver failure.</p>.<p>Excess steroid use often affects the skin, and the issues are similar to the adolescent male going through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a> with its testosterone spike. Hair can become oily.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Acne</a> is often present. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_visual_dictionary_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Acne</a> conglobata is a particularly severe form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">acne</a> that can develop during steroid abuse or even after a person stops taking the drug. Infections are a common side effect of steroid abuse because of needle sharing and unsanitary techniques used when injecting the drugs into the skin. These are similar risks to IV drug abusers with increased potential to acquire blood-borne infections such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV/AIDS</a>.

Doctors often make the diagnosis when someone develops one of the side effects of steroid use.</p>.<p>Once the potential diagnosis of drug abuse is considered, it is important that the health care provider offer the opportunity for the patient to consider drug treatment options, just like any other addictive drug. However, the patient must take the first step in diagnosis and treatment by admitting there is a potential for abuse and their willingness to consider intervention and treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_anabolic_steroid_abuse_and_addiction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Counseling is the mainstay of therapy for anabolic steroid abuse.
