This ultimately can kill the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> cells treated with radiation. A specialist in radiation therapy is called a radiation oncologist.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_radiation_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>External radiation therapy is usually given on an outpatient basis in a hospital or clinic with specialized equipment 5 days a week for a number of weeks. Patients are not radioactive during or after the treatment with external beam radiation therapy.</p>.<p>For internal radiation therapy, the patient often stays in the hospital for a few days. The implant may be temporary or permanent. Because the level of radiation is highest during the hospital stay, patients may not be able to have visitors or may have visitors only for a short time. Once an implant is removed, there is no radioactivity in the body. The amount of radiation given off to the outside from a permanent implant goes down to a safe level before the patient leaves the hospital.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_side_effects_of_radiation_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>With radiation therapy, the side effects depend on the treatment dose and the part of the body that is treated. The most common side effects are:</p>.<p>Radiation therapy can cause inflammation of tissues and organs in and around the body site radiated.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy can also cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which help protect the body against infection. Today radiation therapy using modern types of equipment can be better focused and thereby result in fewer side effects.</p>.<p>Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be unpleasant, they can usually be treated or controlled. It also helps to know that, in most cases, they are not permanent. Again, the possible side effects of radiation therapy depend on the location and the amount of radiation.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
