No method of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth control</a> available today offers perfect protection against

New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. What is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.</p>.<p>Unfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Emergency contraception</a> is a medication or device that is used to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/conception_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">conception</a> after unprotected intercourse has already occurred. It is not intended for use as a primary method of contraception and is most appropriate as a back-up method. Between 2006 and 2010, about 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US report having used emergency contraception. Emergency contraception can involve the administration of hormones or the insertion of an

It can be taken at any time during the 
menstrual cycle, and the next <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual period</a> typically occurs within one week of the expected time. The timing of the subsequent menses is, to some extent, dependent upon the time in the cycle at which the emergency contraceptive was taken.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_dosage_and_what_types_of_the_morning_after_pill_are_available" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common type of emergency hormonal contraception involves the administration of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/progesterone-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">progesterone</a> hormone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levonorgestrel-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">levonorgestrel</a> in two doses (marketed as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levonorgestrel-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Plan B</a> in the U.S.).</p>.<p>Another formulation for emergency hormonal contraception uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">estrogen</a> along with levonorgestrel, but levonorgestrel-only medication may be more effective and causes less nausea compared to estrogen-containing products.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Clinical trials</a> using low doses of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mifepristone-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">mifepristone</a> (known earlier as RU-486, sometimes called "the abortion pill") have shown that this agent is extremely effective as an emergency contraceptive when taken prior to ovulation, but it has not been approved for this use in the US. Mifepristone (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mifepristone-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Mifeprex</a>) has been approved, in much higher doses, for terminating a pregnancy of less than 49 days' duration and must be taken under a physician's supervision.</p>.<p>Another type of anti-progestin medication that is similar to mifepristone in its structure and actions is known as ulipristal acetate. Ulipristal acetate (Ella) is marketed for emergency contraception in Europe and was approved by the US FDA in August 2010 for use in the US for emergency contraception up to 120 hours after intercourse. It is available by prescription only.</p>.<p>Although effectiveness of the oral contraceptives are dependent to some extent upon how soon after unprotected intercourse they are taken, efficacy studies have generally reported a low rate of pregnancy with use of oral emergency contraception.</p>.<p>Emergency contraceptive pills do not protect women from sexually transmitted diseases (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">STDs</a>).</p>.<p>Emergency hormonal contraception or the morning after pill is not meant to be a primary birth control method. Once the emergency is over, a woman should receive proper counseling so that she can select an effective and appropriate contraceptive method to use on a regular basis if she continues to be sexually active.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_emergency_iud" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Like the high dose of oral hormonal contraceptive, an IUD blocks the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall. 
	Emergency IUD insertion can also be used to prevent a pregnancy after unprotected sex. 
	</p>.<p>An added advantage of emergency contraceptive use of an IUD compared to pills is that once the IUD is in place, it will provide the woman with a long-term contraceptive method if she chooses.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
