<p><b><a name="what_are_eosinophils" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eosinophils are a particular type of white blood cells, usually representing a small percentage (less than 8% of the total white blood cell population) that are easily stained by eosin and other dyes; they have a characteristic double-lobed nucleus. The number of these cells (eosinophil count) increases in certain illnesses, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">asthma</a>, Addison's disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sarcoidosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sarcoidosis</a>, parasite infections, drug reactions, and connective tissue diseases (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scleroderma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scleroderma</a>). Eosinophilic fasciitis is sometimes referred to as Shulman's syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_fascia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The fascia is a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue under the skin that covers a surface of underlying tissues. Fascia surrounds each of the muscles that move the skeleton. When the fascia is inflamed, the condition is referred to as "fasciitis."</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_eosinophilic_fasciitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare disease that leads to inflammation and thickening of the skin and fascia underneath. In patients with eosinophilic fasciitis, the involved fascia is inflamed with the eosinophil type of white blood cells. This leads to symptoms of progressive thickening and often redness, warmth, and hardness of the skin surface.</p>.<p>Occasionally, the onset of eosinophilic fasciitis follows a period of exertional physical activity. Eosinophilic fasciitis is sometimes confused with eosinophilia-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_pain_myalgia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">myalgia</a><span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_5"> syndrome and scleroderma.

Occasionally, there is discoloration of the skin over the tissues affected and the skin can appear thicker than normal.

Muscle enzyme blood levels can be found to be elevated in the blood, particularly the enzymes aldolase and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health-care_professionals_diagnose_eosinophilic_fasciitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis is made with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">skin biopsy</a> of a full thickness of involved deep skin tissue. The biopsy site is usually small, and the doctor numbs the area before the tissue is removed for study by a pathologist, dermatologist, or trained technician.
