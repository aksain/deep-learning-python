<p><b><a name="esophageal_cancer_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_esophagus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The esophagus is the first part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a tube-like structure that connects the mouth to the stomach, allowing food and liquid to be swallowed. There are muscles that encircle the esophagus that allow it to contract and push food and liquid toward the stomach. When cancer cells develop in the tissues of this muscular tube, it is defined as esophageal cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Esophageal cancer describes the disease where cells that line the esophagus change or mutate and become malignant. These cells grow out of control and form a mass or tumor.</p>.<p>There are two main types of esophageal cancer:</p>.<p>There are more rare forms of cancer that affect the esophagus, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lymphoma</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/malignant_melanoma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">malignant melanoma</a>, sarcoma, choriocarcinoma, and small cell cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_and_causes_of_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Esophageal cancer occurs because changes occur in the DNA of cells that line the esophagus. The exact reason for these changes or mutations is uncertain, but there are known risk factors for developing these cancers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Esophageal cancer tends not to be associated with symptoms until it grows large enough to narrow the esophagus and make it difficult for food to pass. This also means there is time and opportunity for the cancer to grow beyond the esophagus and spread (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasize</a>) either to surrounding tissues or to distant parts of the body before it is discovered.</p>.<p>The first symptom of esophageal cancer is almost always <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swallowing/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dysphagia</a> (dys=abnormal + phagia=swallowing). Initially there may be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dysphagia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">difficulty swallowing</a> solid foods, but symptoms worsen so there may also problems swallowing liquids.</p>.<p>Because adenocarcinoma of the esophagus may be related to chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of GERD</a> may also be present, including heartburn and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a>. This is often described as a burning sensation located behind or just beneath the breastbone in the upper abdomen.</p>.<p>Patients with esophageal cancer also can present with unexplained <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weight loss</a> which occurs in more than half of patients. Esophageal cancers bleed and may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a> of blood, or passing of melena (black, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tarry stools</a>). Sometimes the bleeding can be microscopic and not seen by the naked eye. The patient may experience weakness due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low red blood cell count</a>, and because it is due to blood loss, it is most often an iron-deficiency <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Pain</a> from esophageal cancer can be felt in the lower chest behind the breastbone or in the upper abdomen. If the cancer has spread, there may be pain in other places around the chest or back.</p>.<p>Patients may experience voice <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hoarseness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">hoarseness</a> due to vocal cord damage caused by reflux of stomach acid into the throat. Water brash describes the bad taste in the back of the mouth from reflux. Acid droplets that cause this foul taste can be aspirated and can inflame the vocal cords, causing a change in voice.</p>.<p>As the tumor grows, it may cause nerve damage if it inflames the recurrent laryngeal nerve that helps control the vocal cords. The nerve runs close to the esophagus, so if cancer spreads to the nerve, it means the cancer has grown beyond the esophagus wall.</p>.<p>Physical examination may not be helpful in making the diagnosis; the esophagus is hidden within the chest cavity and not easily evaluated by physical examination. In the early stage of esophageal cancer, there may be no symptoms at all. It is only when the tumor grows enough to cause problems, do symptoms begin to appear. That is the reason why patient history is so important in making the diagnosis and why all complaints of difficulty swallowing should be taken seriously.</p>.<p>If the cancer has metastasized through the lymph system, beyond the esophagus, there may be abnormal lymph nodes palpable in the neck below the jaw or above the clavicles (collarbones). If cancer has spread to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, the liver may become enlarged and may be palpated on examination of the abdomen.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of esophageal cancer is made by endoscopy and biopsy.</p>.<p>When symptoms of difficulty swallowing (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dysphagia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dysphagia</a>) occur, a gastroenterologist can do a procedure called an endoscopy where the patient swallows a flexible tube with an attached camera and the doctor can look at the full length of the esophagus, the stomach, and the first part of the intestine (duodenum). If a mass or tumor is seen in the esophagus, the gastroenterologist has the ability to take a sample of tissue (biopsy) through the same tube. The patient is usually sedated for endoscopy.</p>.<p>The tissue biopsy is examined by a pathologist using a microscope and the clinical diagnosis is then confirmed.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_determine_esophageal_cancer_staging" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Staging describes a system used to show how deep the cancer has extended into the esophageal tissue, whether it has spread to lymph nodes, and what other organs in the body might be involved.</p>.<p>There is a common system agreed upon by the Union for International Cancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer that uses TNM staging.</p>.<p>With the endoscope, the gastroenterologist can use <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> to determine how deep into the layers of the esophagus the tumor has grown. The doctor can also tell whether lymph nodes that line the esophagus have been invaded.</p>.<p>Either <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> of the chest and abdomen or PET scan is then used to determine the extent of tumor spread.</p>.<p>Depending on the type of cancer and the extent the tumor has spread, there are certain circumstances where more invasive procedures are warranted to help with staging: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/laparoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">laparoscopy</a> (an operation where a surgeon inserts a camera into the abdominal cavity), thoracoscopy (the camera is inserted into the chest cavity), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">bronchoscopy</a> (a camera is inserted into the lung airways).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_stages_of_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The stages of esophageal cancer can be complicated and are related to the following:</p>.<p>Stages are as follows:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The approach to cancer treatment is individualized to each patient's situation. Recommended treatments depend on the stage and health of the patient. A team of physicians will help decide with the patient and family what might be the best approach to their specific situation. These providers may include specialists in medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgery, in addition to the patient's primary care provider.</p>.<p>Esophageal cancer is often found in older patients who have other underlying illnesses that complicate treatment. Esophageal cancer is often diagnosed late in the course of the disease because symptoms often occur only after a tumor has grown and potentially spread. Most often, if the patient can tolerate it, treatment consists of a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.</p>.<p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network maintains up-to-date guidelines based upon ongoing clinical trials that allow cancer specialists to offer treatment advice to patients and family.</p>.<p>The decision to undergo surgery and the type of surgery that might be appropriate depends upon the type of esophageal cancer, its staging, and the underlying health of the patient. Treatment guidelines are continuously being evaluated and revised, based upon the development of new treatments and the results of ongoing clinical trials.</p>.<p>Surgery may involve esophagectomy or removal of the whole esophagus.</p>.<p>Some patients are able to have the removed esophagus replaced with another piece of bowel to connect the mouth to the stomach. If that is not possible, percutaneous gastrostomy may be required to get food and fluid into the stomach to be digested. A tube is placed through the skin and anchored into the stomach to allow tube feedings.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy (also called external beam radiation) may be administered prior to surgery to help shrink the tumor. There are a variety of chemotherapy protocols that may be considered. Surgery may be delayed after the diagnosis is made to allow the chemotherapy and radiation to be administered.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy that have been started after surgery have not been shown to increase survival. However, there may be a benefit to survival when these therapies are continued after surgery, if they were started before the operation.</p>.<p>There are specific genes that are associated with esophageal cancer. In certain circumstances, the tumor can be tested to see whether genes like HER2 are present. Targeted medications can attach or bind to different protein sites on the tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth. This is immunotherapy, which tries to kill only tumor cells, unlike chemotherapy, which also kills normal cells as a side effect.</p>.<p>If the esophageal cancer is confined the walls of the esophagus with no spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs (stage I), surgical removal of the tumor may be accomplished via endoscopic procedure.</p>.<p>Light therapy may be used to treat esophageal cancers that are small in size and have not spread or metastasized. In this treatment, a photo-sensitizing drug is injected into the body where it is absorbed by cells, where they can last for two to three days. However, cancer cells seem to keep a concentration of the drug longer. When the patient is exposed to light from a laser, the drug may kill the cancer cell.</p>.<p>This type of treatment is limited because light cannot penetrate deeply into the body and is effective in only small tumors. At present, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/photodynamic_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">photodynamic therapy</a> is approved for esophageal cancer and non-small-cell <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_kinds_of_doctors_treat_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Esophageal cancer is a condition that usually requires surgical procedures. In addition to the general surgeon, there are many other types of physicians who may contribute to care.</p>.<p>Should the cancer become untreatable or symptom control be needed, palliative care specialists may be involved to help improve quality of life.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_statistics_related_to_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>According to the National Cancer Institute, there will be almost 17,000 new cases of esophageal cancer in the United States in 2017. Approximately 15,600 people will die of the disease.</p>.<p>In the 1970s, more than 90% of esophageal cancers were of the squamous cell type. Now, almost 70% are adenocarcinoma.</p>.<p>It occurs more frequently as people age and is more commonly diagnosed in male patients, aged 60 to 70. Esophageal cancer affects males more than females, almost four to one. It is 20 times more common to be found in patients older than age 65 than in those who are younger.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_support_is_available_for_those_with_esophageal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients, families, and friends are all affected when the diagnosis of cancer is made. Most hospitals and treatment facilities will have support systems available to help with the difficult journey ahead.</p>.<p>The treating professionals will be important resources to relay understanding of the disease, the potential treatment options, and the expected outcomes. It is important for all who are involved to be advocates for the patient; much of the information can be overwhelming. It is reasonable to ask questions of the doctors, nurses, and other care providers.</p>.<p>There are many community resources available as well.
