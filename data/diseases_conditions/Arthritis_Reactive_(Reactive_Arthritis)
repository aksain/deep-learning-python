<p><b><a name="reactive_arthritis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_reactive_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Reactive arthritis is a chronic form of inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a> featuring the following three conditions: (1) inflamed joints, (2) inflammation of the eyes (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">conjunctivitis</a>), and (3) inflammation of the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems.</p>.<p>This form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">joint inflammation</a> is called "reactive arthritis" because it is felt to involve an immune system that is "reacting" to the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bacterial infections</a> in the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Accordingly, certain people's immune systems are genetically primed to react aberrantly when these areas are exposed to certain bacteria. The aberrant reaction of the immune system leads to spontaneous inflammation in the joints and eyes. This can be confounding to the patient and the doctor when the infection has long passed at the time of presentation with arthritis or eye inflammation.</p>.<p>Reactive arthritis has, in the past, been referred to as Reiter syndrome (a term that has lost favor because of Dr. Hans Reiter's dubious past, one of enthusiastically embracing Nazi politics and medical abominations). In addition, Reiter syndrome would refer to a specific type of reactive arthritis limiting inflammation to the eyes, urethra, and joints.</p>.<p>Reactive arthritis most frequently occurs in patients in their 30s or 40s, but it can occur at any age. The form of reactive arthritis that occurs after genital infection (venereal) occurs more frequently in males. The form that develops after bowel infection (dysentery) occurs in equal frequency in males and females.</p>.<p>Reactive arthritis is considered a systemic rheumatic disease. This means it can affect other organs than the joints, causing inflammation in tissues such as the eyes, mouth, skin, kidneys, heart, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>. Reactive arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriatic_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">psoriatic arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ankylosing_spondylitis_iq/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, and arthritis associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Crohn's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ulcerative colitis</a>. Each of these arthritic conditions can cause similar disease and inflammation in the spine and other joints, eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to inflame the spine, these conditions are collectively referred to as "spondyloarthropathies."</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_reactive_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned, reactive arthritis is felt in part to be genetic. There are certain genetic markers that are far more frequent in patients with reactive arthritis than in the normal population. For example, the HLA-B27 gene is commonly seen in patients with reactive arthritis. Even in patients who have the genetic background that predisposes them to developing reactive arthritis, however, exposure to certain infections seems to be required to trigger the onset of the disease.</p>.<p>Reactive arthritis can occur after venereal infections. The most common bacterium that has been associated with this post-venereal form of reactive arthritis is an organism called <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Chlamydia trachomatis</a></i>. Reactive arthritis also occurs after infectious dysentery, with bacterial organisms in the bowel, such as <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/salmonella_food_poisoning_salmonellosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Salmonella</a></i>, <i> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shigella_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Shigella</a></i>, <i>Yersinia</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, and <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clostridium_difficile_colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Clostridium difficile</a></i>. Typically, the arthritis develops one to three weeks after the onset of the bacterial infection. Reactive arthritis has also been reported associated with bladder infusions of BCG used for treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bladder cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_developing_reactive_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_reactive_arthritis_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of reactive arthritis can be divided into those that affect the joints and those that affect the non-joint areas.</p>.<p>The classic joints that can become inflamed in reactive arthritis are the knees, ankles, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>. The particular joints involved are usually asymmetric, that is, one side of the body or the other is affected with signs and symptoms, rather than both sides simultaneously. The inflammation leads to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">joint pain</a>, stiffness, swelling, warmth, and redness. Patients may develop inflammation of entire fingers or toes which can give the appearance of a "sausage digit." This feature is also seen in patients with another type of arthritis called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/psoriatic_arthritis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">psoriatic arthritis</a> that is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin inflammation</a> of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a>.

Muscles attach to the bones by tendons. In reactive arthritis, the tendon insertion points can become inflamed (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enthesitis_and_enthesopathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enthesitis</a>), tender, and painful when exercised. Achilles tendinitis is common with reactive arthritis.</p>.<p>Non-joint areas that become inflamed and cause symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> and irritation in patients with reactive arthritis include the eyes (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctivitis</a>), genitals, urinary tract (urethra, bladder and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">prostate gland</a>), skin, mouth lining, large bowel, and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/aorta_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">aorta</a>.</p>.<p>Inflammation of the white portion of the eye (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">conjunctivitis</a>) and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">iris</a> of the eye (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">iritis</a>) is frequently seen early in reactive arthritis and may be intermittent. When the whites of the eye are inflamed causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctivitis</a>, there may be no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a>.

This inflammation (urethritis) can be associated with burning on urination and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drainage_of_pus/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">pus drainage</a> from the end of the penis. The skin around the penis can become inflamed and peel. The bladder and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">prostate gland</a> can also become inflamed, leading to an urge to urinate from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cystitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostatitis_inflammation_of_the_prostate_gland/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostatitis</a> respectively.</p>.<p>The skin of the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet can develop tiny fluid-filled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a> that sometimes are filled with old blood. The affected skin can peel and may mimic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis_symptoms_treatment_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">psoriasis</a>. The classic appearance is medically referred to as keratoderma blennorrhagica. Similar inflammation of the tip of the penis can cause irritating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> in males, referred to as circinate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/balanitis_penis_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">balanitis</a>.</p>.<p>The mouth can develop open sores (ulcerations) on the hard and soft palate and even on the tongue. These may go unnoticed by the patient, as they are often painless. Inflammation of the large bowel (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">colitis</a>) can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a> or pus or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_the_stool_rectal_bleeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood in the stool</a>. Inflammation of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/aorta_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">aorta</a> (aortitis) can be seen in a small percentage of patients who have reactive arthritis. It can lead to failure of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">aortic valve</a> of the heart, which can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a>. The electrical conducting pathway of the heart can also become scarred in reactive arthritis, leading to irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) that may require placement of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pacemaker/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">pacemaker</a> to regulate the heartbeat.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_do_health_care_professionals_use_to_make_a_diagnosis_of_reactive_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no single lab test used to diagnose reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is diagnosed based upon recognition of the combination of arthritis with symptoms such as inflammation of the eyes, and the genital, urinary, and/or gastrointestinal systems. The health care professional obtains a medical history to note the time course of possible infection in the genital or urinary tracts, or the bowel. Stiffness and pain are monitored. Inflammatory types of joint problems typically cause more stiffness in the morning. Blood tests such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sedimentation rate</a> may be obtained to document the presence of inflammation in the body. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_factor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">rheumatoid factor</a>, which is typically present in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, is usually negative in reactive arthritis. The HLA-B27 gene marker blood test can be helpful, especially in the diagnosis of patients with spine disease. Other tests may be ordered to eliminate other possible diseases with similar symptoms.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> of the spine or other joints can reveal typical changes of inflammation in these areas but generally not until later in the disease. Occasionally, there are areas of unusual calcifications at the points where the tendons attach to the bones, indicating past inflammation in these areas. Those patients with eye inflammation may require ophthalmology evaluation to document the degree of inflammation in the iris. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Stool</a> cultures might be obtained to detect the presence of infections in the bowel. Similarly, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinalysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">urinalysis</a> and culture of the urine may be necessary to detect bacterial infection in the urinary tract. The prostate gland, which can also be inflamed in a patient with reactive arthritis, may be examined for tenderness.</p>.<p>Sometimes the fluid of the inflamed joint needs to be examined. In this case, a health care professional will use a needle to withdraw fluid from the joint in sterile fashion. The joint fluid will be examined for white blood cells, bacteria (to check for infection), and crystals (to eliminate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gout</a> as a diagnosis).<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_reactive_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of reactive arthritis is based on where it has become manifest in the body. For <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">joint inflammation</a>, patients are generally initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a>).

They can be given by mouth or by local injection into the joint. Corticosteroids are also used to decrease tendon inflammation in some forms of tendinitis.</p>.<p>Antibiotics may be prescribed if one still has the infection that triggered reactive arthritis.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfasalazine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sulfasalazine</a> (Azulfidine) has been shown to be effective in some patients with persistent reactive arthritis.
