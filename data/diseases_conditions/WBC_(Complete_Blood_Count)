<p>The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:</p>.<p>The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. These calculations are generally determined by special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute.</p>.<p>A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The complete blood count (CBC) test is performed by obtaining a few milliliters (one to two teaspoons) of blood sample directly form the patient. It can be done in many settings including the doctor's office, laboratories, and hospitals. The skin is wiped clean with an alcohol pad, and a needle is inserted through the area of cleansed skin into to patient's vein (one that can be visualized from the skin.) The blood is pulled from the needle by a syringe or by a connection to a special vacuumed vial where it is collected. This sample is taken to the laboratory for analysis. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The values generally included are the following: </p>.<p>A machine generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential.</p>.<p>Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells, but larger than platelets. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.</p>.<p>Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.  <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments. It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms.</p>.<p>For example, a <b>high WBC count</b> (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">malignancy</a>. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a>. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to a treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions.</p>.<p>A <b>low red blood cell count</b> or low hemoglobin may suggest <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>, which can have many causes.
