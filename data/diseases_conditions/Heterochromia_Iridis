<p><b><a name="heterochromia_iridis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heterochromia iridis is a condition in which the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">iris</a> in one eye has a different color than the iris of the other eye. The iris is the tissue of the eye that surrounds the pupil and imparts a color, whether green, blue, brown, hazel, grey, or other, to the eye. Heterochromia iridis is to be differentiated from heterochromia (difference in color) iridum (within the iris of one eye).</p>.<p>Iris color is the result of the pigment that is present in the iris. Brown eyes have large amounts of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">melanin</a> pigment deposits, and blue eyes have a lack of melanin. Although eye color is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>, the inheritance pattern is complex, with interaction of more than one gene. These genes interact to provide the full constellation of colors. Other genes may determine the pattern and placement of pigment in the iris, thereby accounting for solid brown as opposed to rays of color. Normally, the two irises of an individual are of the same color. In heterochromia, the affected eye may be hyperpigmented (darker or hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (lighter or hypochromic). Eye color is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin within the iris tissues.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_rare_is_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heterochromia can be present at birth (congenital) or acquired. The incidence of congenital heterochromia iridis is approximately six out of a 1,000, although in most of these cases, it is hardly noticeable and unassociated with any other abnormality.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heterochromia is classified primarily by its time of onset as either genetic (congenital, present at or shortly after birth) or acquired. Most cases of heterochromia are hereditary, and these may be associated with a congenital syndrome. Other cases are acquired and caused by a disease or due to an injury. Sometimes one eye may change color following certain diseases or injuries. Heterochromia present at or shortly after birth is usually hereditary or due to intrauterine disease or injury. The genetics of eye color determination involves at least eight different genes, with inherited eye color being based on various combinations of gene expression. Congenital heterochromia may be familial and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Environmental or acquired factors can alter these inherited traits. An infant with heterochromia should be examined by both a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist for other possible problems. If another disorder is suspected, diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or chromosome studies, may be done to confirm the diagnosis.</p>.<p>Most cases of heterochromia at birth are genetic and unassociated with any other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ocular</a> or systemic abnormality. This is simply called congenital heterochromia iridis. The lighter eye usually shows some loss of iris and therefore is regarded as the affected eye. The lighter iris may be differently colored throughout or only in part.</p>.<p><b>Congenital syndromes</b> which may be characterized by heterochromia iridis include:</p>.<p><b>Acquired conditions or diseases</b> that may present with heterochromia iridis include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Familial genetic abnormalities, ocular trauma, and inflammation are all risk factors for the development of heterochromia iridis. The use of prostaglandin analogue eyedrops for glaucoma or to stimulate eyelash growth is a modifiable risk factor.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_heterochromia_iridis_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The appearance of different coloration between the two eyes is usually the only symptom or sign. Many times the difference is so slight that it is only noticed under certain lighting conditions or in close-up photographs. If inflammation or trauma is the cause, other signs or symptoms may be present. Heterochromia iridis is termed complete when the entire iris in one eye is different in color than that of the other eye. Segmental heterochromia involves only a radial or piece-of-pie-shaped area of one iris. In central heterochromia, there is an inner ring of the iris that is different in color from the rest of the iris. The term heterochromia iridum can be used when the heterochromia is incomplete, as in segmental or central heterochromia.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heterochromia iris is usually noted by the parent of a baby or in acquired cases, by the patient or a family member. Diagnosis can be confirmed through slit lamp examination by an ophthalmologist.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_treatment_for_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If the heterochromia is secondary to an underlying cause such as inflammation, treatment should be directed at the underlying condition. In situations in which there is a major cosmetic impairment, a tinted contact <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lens</a> may be used to darken the lighter appearing eye or lighten the darker appearing eye. Two differing colored contact lenses may also be used to arrive at an average color.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_heterochromia_iridis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The vast majority of people with heterochromia iridis have an excellent prognosis and have no visual complaints. Most cases are very mild, nonprogressive, and unassociated with any other illness or eye disease. In patients with associated ocular or systemic problems, treatment of the underlying abnormality is often successful in preventing visual loss.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
