<p><b><a name="head_injury_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="head_injury_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While head injuries are one of the most common causes of death and disability in the United States. A majority of patients with head injuries are treated and released from the emergency room.</p>.<p>Blows to the head most often cause brain injury, but shaking may also cause damage. The face and jaw are located in the front of the head, and brain injury may also be associated with injuries to these structures. It is also important to note that a head injury does not always mean that there is also a brain injury.</p>.<p>The brain is a soft and pliable material, almost jelly-like in feel, and is surrounded by a thin layer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The brain is lined by thin layers of tissue called the meninges; 1) the pia mater, 2) the arachnoid mater, and 3) the dura mater. The cerebrospinal fluid is present in the space beneath the arachnoid layer called the subarachnoid space.</p>.<p>The dura mater is very thick and has septae, or partitions, that help support the brain within the skull. The septae attach to the inner lining of the bones of the skull. The dura mater also helps support the large veins that return blood from the brain to the heart.</p>.<p>The spaces between the meninges are usually very small but they can fill with blood when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> occurs, and this buildup of blood can potentially press into the brain tissue and cause damage.</p>.<p>The skull protects the brain from trauma but it does not absorb any of the impact from a blow. Direct blows may cause fractures of the skull. There can be a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contusion</a> or bruising and bleeding to the brain tissue directly beneath the injury site. However, the brain can bounce around, or slosh, inside the skull and because of this, the brain injury may not necessarily be located directly below the trauma site. A contre-coup injury describes the situation in which the initial blow causes the brain to bounce away from that blow and is damaged by hitting the skull directly opposite the trauma site. Acceleration/deceleration and rotation are the common types of forces that can cause injuries away from the area of the skull that received the trauma.</p>.<p><b>Picture of the brain and potential brain injury areas</b> <!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p>Head injuries due to bleeding are often classified by the location of the blood within the skull.</p>.<p>Skull fractures are described by which bone is broken, whether there is an associated laceration of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a> (open fracture), and whether the bone is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depressed</a> and potentially pushed into the brain tissue.</p>.<p>Brain injuries often occur in combination with one another. The effects of brain injury depend upon the amount of brain tissue damaged and the level of pressure within the skull and its effects on the brain.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_head_injury" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>By definition, trauma is required to cause a head injury, but that trauma does not necessarily need to be violent. Falling down a few steps or falling into a hard object may be enough to cause damage. Motor vehicle crashes account for 
about 17% of traumatic brain injuries, while 35% are from falls. The majority of head injuries occur in males.</p>.<p>Penetrating head injuries describe those situations in which the injury occurs due to a projectile, for example a bullet, or when an object is impaled though the skull into the brain. </p>.<p>Closed head injuries refer to injuries in which no lacerations are present. </p>.<p>The brain may also be injured without a direct blow to the skull. The head sits on the neck allowing it to shake, causing the brain to slosh inside the skull and become injured.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_head_injury" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of head injury can vary from almost none to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loss of consciousness</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coma</a>. As well, the symptoms may not necessarily occur immediately at the time of injury. While a brain injury occurs at the time of trauma, it may take time for enough swelling or bleeding to occur to cause symptoms that are recognizable.</p>.<p>Initial symptoms may include a change in mental status, meaning an alteration in the wakefulness of the patient. There may be loss of consciousness, lethargy, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a>. </p>.<p>Head injury symptoms may also include:</p>.<p>Other symptoms may be more subtle and include:</p>.<p>Late signs of significant head injury and raised pressure within the brain and skull include a dilated pupil, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>, low pulse rate, and abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a> pattern.</p>.<p>Coma may be present if the patient doesn't awaken completely and is defined as a prolonged episode of loss of consciousness. There are different levels of coma and the Glasgow Coma Scale is one way of measuring its depth.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_glasgow_coma_scale" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The Glasgow Coma Scale was developed to provide health care practitioners a simple way of measuring the depth of coma based upon observations of eye opening, speech, and movement. Patients in the deepest level of coma:</p>.<p>Those in lighter comas may offer some response, to the point they may even seem awake, yet meet the criteria of coma because they do not respond to their environment.</p>.<p>An awake person has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, while a person who is dead would have a score of 3. The abnormal motor responses of flexion and extension describe arm and leg movement when a painful stimulus is applied. The term "<b>decorticate</b>" means that the cortex of the brain, the part that deals with movement, sensation, and thinking, is not working. "<b>Decerebrate</b>" means that the cerebrum (the whole brain), the cortex, and the brainstem that controls basic bodily functions like breathing and heartbeat, is not working.</p>.<p>The scale is used as part of the initial evaluation of a patient, but does not assist in making the diagnosis as to the cause of coma. Since it "scores" the level of coma, the Glasgow Coma Scale can be used as a standard method for pre-hospital emergency providers to determine the severity of head injury. It also allows the next provider in the chain of care to compare their assessment to the previous one. In this way, there is a standard score to determine whether the patient is improving or decompensating from the injury scene during the transitions to the ER, to the operating room, or ICU.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_contact_a_doctor_about_a_head_injury" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is not normal to be unconscious or not fully awake. Emergency medical services (call 9-1-1 in your areas if it is available) should be activated for persons who have sustained an injury.</p>.<p>Because head injuries may also be associated with neck injuries, victims should not be moved unless they are in harm's way. If possible, it is important to wait for trained medical personnel to help with immobilizing and moving the patient.</p>.<p>If the patient is awake and feeling normal, it may be worthwhile seeking medical care if there was significant trauma. These patients may be considered to have minor head injury or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_concussion/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concussion</a>, and there is a significant amount of research that has been done to decide which persons with head injury should be admitted to the hospital for observation or have a CT (computerized tomography) scan of the head to look for bleeding.</p>.<p>While there are many guidelines from which to choose, recent literature suggests that any of them work well to help a physician decide who might have a brain injury associated with a head injury. These guidelines apply to people ages 16 to 65 who are fully awake and have a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Potential brain injury may exist if the patient had any of the following:</p>.<p>Those older than 65 years of age are at increased risk of bleeding from head injury because the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> brain shrinks away from the skull, causing the veins that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bridge</a> from the skull to the brain surface to be more easily torn.</p>.<p>If a person is taking a blood-thinning medication such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">warfarin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Coumadin</a>), clopidogrel (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clopidogrel/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Plavix</a>), prasugrel (Effient), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rivaroxaban/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rivaroxaban</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rivaroxaban/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Xarelto</a>), they are also at an increased risk of a brain injury, even if there is relatively minor trauma.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_head_injury_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As with most injuries and illnesses, finding out what happened to the patient is very important. The health care professional will take a history of the events. The information may be provided by the patient, people who witnessed the event, emergency medical personnel, and if applicable, the police. The circumstances are very important since it is important to find out the severity and intensity of the trauma sustained by the head. Please be aware, even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/microcephaly/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">small head</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bumps</a> or shaking can cause a brain injury.</p>.<p>Physical examination begins with assessing the ABCs (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">airway</a>, breathing, circulation) to make certain that the patient is stable and does not need emergent life-saving interventions. This is especially important in those patients who are unconscious and may not be able to maintain their own airway or breathe on their own.</p>.<p>If the patient is not fully awake, the examination will initially try to determine the level of coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale number is useful in tracking whether the patient is improving or declining in function over time.</p>.<p>If no other injuries are found on examining the body, attention will be paid to the head and the neurologic exam.</p>.<p>The skull may be examined for signs of trauma, including bruising (contusion) and swelling (hematoma). Palpating or feeling the skull may find evidence of a fracture. If a laceration is present, it is important to know if there is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">broken bone</a> beneath it. The face may be examined as well, since the face provides protection to the front of the head.</p>.<p>The health care professional may also examine the patient for evidence of a basilar skull fracture, in which an injury has occurred to the bones that support the brain. Signs of this type of fracture include:</p>.<p>The neurologic exam may include evaluation of the cranial nerves, the short nerves that leave the brain and control the face muscles, eye movements, swallowing, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a>, and sight, among other functions.</p>.<p>The exam may include evaluation of muscle tone and strength of the arms and legs; sensation in the extremities (including light touch, pain, and vibration); and if the neck is determined not to be injured, the patient's ability to walk may be assessed.</p>.<p>Depending upon the findings of the physical examination, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a> may be needed to look for bleeding in the brain.</p>.<p>It is important to remember that injuries to other parts of the body may also be present, and the evaluation of the head injury may occur at the same time as the evaluation of other injuries.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_head_injury_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of a head injury depends upon the type of injury. For patients with minor head injuries (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/concussions_brain_injuries_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concussions</a>), nothing more may be needed other than observation and symptom control. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Headache</a> may require pain medication. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Nausea</a> and vomiting may require medications to control these symptoms.</p>.<p><b>Bleeding</b></p>.<p><b>Intracerebral bleeding</b> or bleeding in the spaces surrounding the brain are neurosurgical emergencies, although not all bleeding requires an operation. The decision to operate will be individualized based upon the injury and the patient's medical status.</p>.<p>One option may include craniotomy, drilling a hole into the skull or removing part of one of the skull bones to remove or drain a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clot</a>, and thereby relieve pressure on brain tissue.</p>.<p>Other times, the treatment is supportive, and there may be a need to monitor the pressure within the brain. The neurosurgeon may place a pressure monitor through a drilled hole through the skull to monitor the pressure. The slang term for this procedure is "placing a bolt."</p>.<p>Supportive care is often required for those patients with significant amounts of bleeding in their brain and who are in coma. Many times, the patient requires <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endotracheal_intubation/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intubation</a> to help control breathing and to protect them from vomiting and aspirating vomit into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>. Medications may be used to sedate the patient for comfort and to prevent injury if the bleeding causes combativeness. Medications may also be used to try to control swelling in the brain if necessary.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_head_injury" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The goal for the treatment of any patient is to return to the level of function that they had prior to the injury.
