The spleen:</p>.<p><b><a name="where_is_the_spleen_what_does_it_look_like_picture" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The spleen is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, just beneath the diaphragm and next to the stomach. It has a very rich blood supply since it is responsible for filtering blood, and it is protected by the 9th, 10th, and 11th ribs. Normally, it is the size of an orange or a small fist.</p>.<p>The spleen has two types of tissue; the red pulp is responsible for filtering blood, while the white pulp is responsible for its immune function.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_type_of_pain_does_an_enlarged_spleen_cause_where_is_the_pain_located" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_other_signs_and_symptoms_of_an_enlarged_spleen" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_an_enlarged_spleen" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The spleen will enlarge when it performs more of its duties to filter blood or to manufacture blood cells. Therefore, any disease or condition that damages red blood cells, and requires them to be filtered and removed from the blood stream, will cause the spleen to become larger.</p>.<p>Conditions such as hemolytic anemia, where red blood cells are damaged and broken down (hemolyzed) can cause the spleen to enlarge. Misshapen red blood cells, like those found in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sickle cell disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_thalassemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thalassemia</a>, and spherocytosis, may be damaged when they try to squeeze through small capillary blood vessels. These damaged red blood cells need to be culled from the bloodstream and are filtered out by the spleen.</p>.<p>The spleen will enlarge if there is a decrease in blood flow through the splenic vein. This may cause spleen congestion and enlargement. This situation may be associated with liver disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/portal_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">portal hypertension</a>. Damage to liver cells makes it difficult for blood to flow normally, and as blood backs up in the portal vein system, it may affect pressure in the splenic vein. The decreased ability of blood to drain from the spleen causes it to become congested and grow larger.

Either the health care practitioner is looking for an enlarged spleen because of a diagnosis that has already been made, or it is found incidentally when initially examining a patient (and it then serves as a clue to an underlying diagnosis).</p>.<p>With its location protected beneath the left lower ribs, a normal spleen is usually not felt on physical exam, except in some unusually thin individuals. As it enlarges, the spleen grows from the left upper quadrant of the abdomen towards the umbilicus (the belly button). Sometimes the doctor will ask the patient to roll on their right side to better attempt to feel the spleen. An enlarged spleen may not be felt in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obese</a> patients.</p>.<p>On occasion, an enlarged spleen may be diagnosed by plain X-ray, ultrasound, abdominal CT scan, or MRI (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">magnetic resonance imaging</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_an_enlarged_spleen_are_there_natural_treatments" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because splenomegaly is due to an underlying illness, treatment will depend upon the primary cause. In some situations, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be part of the treatment. For example, in hereditary spherocytosis, a condition in which red blood cells are abnormal and shaped like a sphere instead of the concave disk shape. These abnormal red blood cells are filtered from the blood stream, which causes anemia and an enlarged spleen. Splenectomy limits the number of red blood cells destroyed and helps treat the disease.</p>.<p>There are no natural treatments for an enlarged spleen.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_complications_are_associated_with_an_enlarged_spleen" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Perhaps the most important worry with an enlarged spleen is the risk of injury as it grows beyond the protection of the rib cage. A minor injury may cause it to rupture and bleed. Spleen injuries are often treated by observation, but on occasion, the spleen can rupture causing life threatening <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/internal_bleeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">internal bleeding</a> requiring surgery for to remove the spleen. This is the reason that teenagers and young adults diagnosed with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">infectious mononucleosis</a> need to wait until the spleen returns to its normal size, and is protected by the rib cage, before participating in activities where the enlarged spleen could be damaged.</p>.<p>All types of blood cells may become trapped in a large spleen. Anemia (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low red blood cell count</a>) may cause</p>.<p>Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.</p>.<p><b>Leukopenia</b> (low white blood cell count) may be associated with an increased risk of infection.</p>.<p>Should the spleen need to be removed surgically (<b>splenectomy</b>), the risk of certain infections increases, and the patient will need to make certain that their immunizations are up to date, especially against <i>pneumococcus</i>, <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/meningococcemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meningococcus</a></i> and <i>haemophilus influenzae</i>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_an_enlarged_spleen_can_you_live_without_it" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Often, the prognosis for an enlarged spleen depends entirely upon the underlying illness. For example, in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/infectious_mononucleosis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">infectious mononucleosis</a>, the spleen will return to its normal size once the infection resolves.</p>.<p>In some instances, the spleen may need to be removed and the risk of infection may increase. In other cases, the spleen will remain enlarged and leave the patient at an increased risk for bleeding, spleen rupture, and infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_an_enlarged_spleen_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An enlarged spleen is the consequence of an underlying illnesses, many of which may not be anticipated or prevented.</p>.<p>Finally, certain infectious diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a>, malaria, tuberculosis, and anaplasmosis can be prevented if the appropriate measures are taken to minimize the risks of acquiring the disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
