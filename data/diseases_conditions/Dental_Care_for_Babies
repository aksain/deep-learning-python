<p><b><a name="clean" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's a good idea to get in the habit of cleaning your baby's gums even

</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teething/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Teething</a> refers to the time when baby teeth (also called deciduous teeth or
primary teeth) appear. Generally, teething first occurs between 6 months and 24
months of age. While this process is uneventful in some children; for others,
it causes quite a bit of discomfort and irritability.</p>.<p>
      Check out this tooth chart and
learn when to expect your baby's teeth to appear.</p>.<p><b><a name="symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms include:</p>.<p>Teething does not result in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. If your child experiences these problems, contact your 
doctor.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Teething biscuits or cookies and frozen bananas are not recommended. These
objects promote tooth decay and may cause your child to choke.</p>.<p><b><a name="born" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Some infants are born with one or more teeth (called natal teeth) or may
have teeth emerge within the first 30 days of life (called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">neonatal</a> teeth).</p>.<p>These usually are either extra teeth or are remnants from neonatal
development that do not need treatment. If they are, however, actual teeth,
it's a good idea to maintain them. Your doctor, however, may recommend removing
them if the teeth are loose and pose a danger of being inhaled by your baby.
Early teeth may also interfere with feeding or irritate your baby's tongue.</p>.<p>Talk to your doctor to see what treatment is right for your baby.</p>.<p>Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.</p>.<p class="credits">Reviewed by Jay H.
