<p><b><a name="brain_damage_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Brain damage is an injury that causes the destruction or deterioration of brain cells.</p>.<p>In the U.S., every year, about 1.4 million people have some type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain injury</a>. And approximately 5.3 million people suffer from the effects of brain damage. About 50,000 die as a result of brain injury. Medical costs and lost productivity are estimated at between $48 billion and $60 billion per year.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_brain_damage_and_how_severe_are_they" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries. But <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">head injury</a> is not necessarily brain injury. There are two types of brain injury: traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury. Both disrupt the brain's normal functioning.</p>.<p>Both traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury occur after birth. And neither is degenerative. Sometimes, the two terms are used interchangeably.</p>.<p>There is a kind of brain damage that results from genetics or birth <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>. It's called congenital brain damage. It is not included, though, within the standard definition of brain damage or traumatic brain injury.</p>.<p>Most brain injuries cause focal -- or localized -- brain damage, such as the damage caused when a bullet enters the brain. In other words, the damage is confined to a small area. Closed head injuries frequently cause diffuse brain damage, which means damage to several areas of the brain. For example, both major speech and language areas might be involved.</p>.<p>The severity of brain damage can vary with the type of brain injury. A mild brain injury is temporary. It causes such symptoms as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a>, memory problems, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>. In a moderate brain injury, symptoms can last longer and be more pronounced. In both cases, most patients make a good recovery.</p>.<p>With a serious brain injury, the person may suffer life-changing and debilitating problems. People who are in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coma</a> or a minimally responsive state are examples of those who are likely to have permanent brain damage.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_brain_damage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When the brain is starved of oxygen for a prolonged period of time, brain damage may occur. Brain damage can occur as a result of a wide range of injuries, illnesses, or conditions. Because of high-risk behaviors, males between the ages of 15 and 24 are most vulnerable. Young children and the elderly also have a higher risk.</p>.<p>Causes of traumatic brain injury include:</p>.<p>Causes of acquired brain injury include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_brain_damage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are numerous symptoms of brain damage, whether traumatic or acquired. They fall into four major categories:
</p>.<p><b>Cognitive symptoms of brain damage include:</b></p>.<p><b>Perceptual symptoms of brain damage include:</b></p>.<p><b>Physical symptoms of brain damage include:</b></p>.<p><b>Behavioral/emotional symptoms of brain damage include:</b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_brain_damage_and_brain_injuries_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anyone who has a head or brain injury needs immediate medical attention.</p>.<p>A brain injury that seems mild -- referred to as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_concussion/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concussion</a> -- can be as dangerous as clearly severe injuries. The key factor is the extent and location of the damage. Brain injury does not necessarily result in long-term disability or impairment. But the correct diagnosis and treatment is needed to contain or minimize the damage.</p>.<p>The extent and effect of brain damage is determined by a neurological exam, neuroimaging testing such as X-rays or CT scans, and neuropsychological assessment such as checking reflexes. Doctors will stabilize the patient to prevent further injury, ensure blood and oxygen are flowing properly to the brain, and ensure that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> is controlled.</p>.<p>About half of severely injured patients require surgery to repair a ruptured blood vessel or to relieve pressure on the brain.</p>.<p>If a patient is severely injured, rehabilitation may be ordered to assist in long-term recovery. That may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="can_i_prevent_brain_injuries" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most injuries that cause brain damage are preventable.
