<p><b><a name="pregnancy_and_h1n1_influenza_swine_flu_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These questions and answers have been updated to include new information on 
2009 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swine_flu/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">H1N1</a> flu in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> women. Both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> will 
circulate during the 2009-2010 flu season. A pregnant woman who thinks she has 
the flu should call her doctor right away to see if treatment with an antiviral 
medicine is needed. The medicine is most helpful if it is started soon after the 
pregnant woman becomes sick. The latest advice for getting seasonal and 2009 
H1N1 vaccines during pregnancy is also included.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_i_am_pregnant_and_i_get_2009_h1n1" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Call your doctor right away if you have 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu symptoms</a> or if you have close 
contact with someone who has the flu. Pregnant women who get sick with 2009 H1N1 
can have serious health problems. They can get sicker than other people who get 
2009 H1N1 flu. Some pregnant women sick with 
2009 H1N1 have had 
early labor and 
severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>. Some have died. If you are pregnant and have symptoms of the

Talk 
with your doctor about getting a seasonal flu shot and the 2009 H1N1 flu shot. 
You will need both flu shots this year to be fully protected against flu. You 
should get both shots as soon as they are available to protect you and your 
baby. The seasonal flu shot has been shown to protect both the mother and her 
baby (up to 6 months old) from flu-like illness.</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor right away if you have close contact with someone who 
has 2009 H1N1 flu. You might need to take medicine to reduce your chances of 
getting the flu. Your doctor may prescribe 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oseltamivir/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tamiflu</a>® or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zanamivir/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Relenza</a>® to help prevent 
2009 H1N1 flu. To prevent flu, you would take a lower dose of the antiviral 
medicine for 10 days.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_safe_for_pregnant_women_to_get_a_flu_shot" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The seasonal flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many 
years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a>. The 2009 H1N1 flu shot is made in the same way and in the same places as 
the seasonal flu shot. It is very important for pregnant women to get both the 
seasonal flu shot and the 2009 H1N1 flu shot. </p>.<p>Anybody who will be taking care of babies younger than 6 months of age should 
get a seasonal flu shot and a 2009 H1N1 flu shot to protect against the flu. 
This includes you and any family members or other people who will be caring for 
your baby for the first 6 months of his or her life. </p>.<p>Take these everyday steps to help prevent the spread of germs and protect

Breast milk is the perfect food for your baby. There 
are many ways that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breastfeeding</a> and breast milk protect your baby's health. 
Babies who are breastfed get sick from infections like the flu less often and 
less severely than babies who are not breastfed.</p>.<p>Flu can be very serious in young babies. You do not have to stop 
breastfeeding if you have the flu, but you have to be careful to protect your 
baby from getting sick. Please see http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/infantfeeding.htm 
to learn more about how to feed your baby if you are sick.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_does_cdc_advise_pregnant_women_to_receive_the_2009_h1n1_influenza_flu_vaccine_shot" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Getting the flu shot is the single best way to protect against the flu. It is 
important for a pregnant woman to receive both the 2009 H1N1 flu shot and the 
seasonal flu shot. A pregnant woman who gets any type of flu has a greater 
chance for serious health problems. Compared with people in general who get 2009 
H1N1 flu (formerly called "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swine_flu/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swine flu</a>"), pregnant women with 2009 H1N1 flu are 
more likely to be admitted to hospitals. Pregnant women are also more likely to 
have serious illness and death from 2009 H1N1 flu. When a pregnant woman gets a 
flu shot, it can protect both her and her baby. Research has found that pregnant 
women who had a flu shot get sick less often with the flu than do pregnant women 
who did not get a flu shot. Babies born to mothers who had a flu shot in 
pregnancy also get sick with flu less often than do babies whose mothers did not 
get a flu shot. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="will_the_seasonal_flu_shot_also_protect_against_the_2009_h1n1_flu" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 flu are caused by different viruses. The 
seasonal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu_vaccination/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu vaccine</a> will not protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 flu 
vaccine will not protect against seasonal flu. </p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_flu_vaccines_that_pregnant_women_should_not_get" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines can be given by shot or by nasal 
spray. Pregnant women should get the "flu shot" - a vaccine made with killed flu 
virus. This one is given with a needle, usually in the arm. The other type of 
flu vaccine - a nasal spray - is not approved for pregnant women. This vaccine is 
made with live, weakened flu virus. Nasal spray flu vaccine should be used only 
in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant. The nasal spray 
vaccine is safe for women after they have delivered, even if they are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nursing</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_the_seasonal_flu_shot_and_the_2009_h1n1_flu_shot_be_given_at_the_same_time" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu shots can be given on the same day but should be 
given at different sites (e.g., one shot in the left arm and the other shot in 
the right arm). If a woman is getting her vaccines after delivery, she can get 
the nasal spray flu vaccine. However, she should not get the seasonal and 2009 
H1N1 nasal spays on the same day; they should be given 4 weeks apart.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_the_2009_h1n1_flu_shot_safe_for_pregnant_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The seasonal flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many 
years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their 
babies. The 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine is being made in the same way and at the same 
places where the seasonal flu vaccine is made. </p>.<p>Studies to test the 2009 H1N1 flu shots in healthy children and adults and 
pregnant women are being done now. Results are available from some of the 
studies done in non-pregnant adults and children. These results show that the 
immune system responded well to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and the safety results 
were very similar to those seen in studies of seasonal flu vaccine. These 
studies are being conducted by the National Institute of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Allergy</a> and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID) and the vaccine manufacturers. </p>.<p>There is no evidence that thimerosal (a mercury preservative in vaccine that 
comes in multi-dose vials) is harmful to a pregnant woman or a fetus. However, 
because some women are concerned about thimerosal during pregnancy, vaccine 
companies are making preservative-free seasonal flu vaccine and 2009 H1N1 flu 
vaccine in single-dose syringes for pregnant women and small children. CDC 
advises pregnant women to get flu shots either with or without thimerosal. </p>.<p>Adjuvants are agents that are sometimes added to a vaccine to make it more 
effective. There are no adjuvants (such as squalene) in either the 2009 H1N1 or 
seasonal flu shot used in the United States. </p>.<p>Both seasonal flu shots and 2009 H1N1 flu shots are recommended for pregnant 
women at any time during pregnancy.</p>.<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of one shot 
for full protection for persons 10 years and older. Therefore, a pregnant woman 
is recommended to get one dose of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. </p>.<p>A pregnant woman who had a flu-like illness at any time in the past should 
still get the 2009 H1N1 shot because she cannot assume that the illness she had 
was caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. Pregnant women who had flu symptoms in the 
past do not need to be tested now, but should get the vaccine. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_possible_side_effects_of_the_2009_h1n1_flu_shots" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The side effects from 2009 H1N1 flu shots are expected to be like those from 
seasonal flu shots. The most common side effects after flu shots are mild, such 
as being sore and tender and/or red and swollen where the shot was given. Some 
people might have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, muscle aches, fever, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> or feel tired. If 
these problems happen, they usually begin soon after the shot and may last as 
long as 1-2 days. Some people may faint after getting any shot. Sometimes, flu 
shots can cause serious problems like severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> reactions. But, 
life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. A person who has 
a severe (life-threatening) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergy</a> to eggs or to anything else in the vaccine 
should not get the shot, even if she is pregnant. Pregnant women should tell the 
person giving the shots if they have any severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a> or if they have ever 
had a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anaphylaxis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">severe allergic reaction</a> following a flu shot.</p>.<p>In 1976, an earlier type of swine flu vaccine was associated with cases of a 
severe paralytic illness called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guillain-barre_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Guillain-Barre Syndrome</a> (GBS) at a rate of 
approximately 1 case of GBS per 100,000 persons vaccinated. Some studies done 
since 1976 have shown a small risk of GBS in persons who received the seasonal 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">influenza</a> vaccine. This risk is estimated to be no more than 1 case of GBS per 1 
million persons vaccinated. Other studies have shown no increase in risk of GBS. 
Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have ever had 
GBS.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_the_h1n1_nasal_spray_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnant women should not receive nasal spray for the seasonal or 2009 H1N1 
flu vaccine, but it is okay for a pregnant woman to be around a family member or 
another close contact who has received nasal spray flu vaccine. The nasal spray 
vaccine can be used in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant and 
in women after they deliver, even if they are nursing. </p>.<p>Yes. No special precautions are needed. Nurses and doctors should wash their 
hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub before and after giving the vaccine.</p>.<p>The nasal spray flu vaccine has not been approved for pregnant women. It 
differs from the flu shot because it is made with live, weakened virus. However, 
sometimes a pregnant woman might get the nasal spray flu vaccine—for example, 
before she knew she was pregnant. If this happened, she would not be expected to 
have any additional problems. The weakened, live flu virus has never been shown 
to be passed to the unborn baby. However, if a woman does get the nasal spray 
vaccine while she is pregnant, she should talk to her healthcare provider.</p>.<p>Yes. Besides protecting her from infection, the shot may also help protect 
her infant. Flu shots are only given to infants 6 months of age and older. 
Everyone who lives with or gives care to an infant less than 6 months of age 
should get both the seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 vaccines. A woman can get either 
the shots or the nasal spray after she delivers. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_breastfeeding_and_the_h1n1_influenza_and_vaccination_safety" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines should be given to 
breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding women can receive either the shot or the 
nasal spray form of the vaccine. Breastfeeding is fully compatible with flu 
vaccination, and preventing the flu in mothers can reduce the chance that the 
infant will get the flu. Also, by breastfeeding, mothers can pass on to the 
infant the antibodies that their bodies make in response to the flu shots, which 
can reduce the infant's chances of getting sick with the flu. This is especially 
important for infants less than 6 months old, who have no other way of receiving 
vaccine antibodies, since they are too young to be vaccinated.</p>.<p>Take everyday precautions such as washing your hands with plain soap and 
water before feeding your baby. If soap and water are not available, use an 
alcohol-based hand rub to clean your hands before feeding your baby. In addition, try not to 
cough or sneeze in the baby's face while feeding your baby, or any other time 
you and your baby are close. If possible, only family members who are not sick 
should care for infants. If you are sick and there is no one else to care for 
your baby, wear a facemask, if available and tolerable, and cover your mouth and 
nose with a tissue when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sneezing</a>. </p>.<p>Infants are thought to be at higher risk for severe illness from 2009 H1N1 
infection and very little is known about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> of 2009 H1N1 flu infection 
in infants. If you are breastfeeding or giving your baby <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/baby_health_bottle_feeding_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infant formula</a>, a 
cautious approach would be to protect your baby from exposure to the flu virus 
in the following ways:</p>.<p>There are many ways that breastfeeding and breast milk protect babies' 
health. Flu can be very serious in young babies. Babies who are not breastfed 
get sick from infections like the flu more often and more severely than babies 
who are breastfed.</p>.<p>Since this is a new virus, we don't know yet about specific protection 
against it. Mothers pass on protective antibodies to their baby during 
breastfeeding. Antibodies are a type of protein made by the immune system in the 
body. Antibodies help fight off infection. </p>.<p>If you are sick with flu and are breastfeeding, someone who is not sick can 
give your baby your expressed milk. </p>.<p>No. Because mothers make antibodies to fight diseases they come in contact 
with, their milk is custom-made to fight the diseases their babies are exposed 
to as well. This is really important in young babies when their immune system is 
still developing. It is OK to take medicines to prevent the flu while you are 
breastfeeding. You should make sure you wash your hands often and take everyday 
precautions. However, if you develop 
symptoms of the flu such as fever, cough, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>, you should ask someone 
who is not sick to care for your baby. If you become sick, someone who is not 
sick can give your baby your expressed milk.</p>.<p>Yes. Mothers who are breastfeeding and taking medicine to treat flu because 
they are sick should express their breast milk for bottle feedings, which can be 
given to your baby by someone who is not sick. Mothers who are breastfeeding and 
are taking medicines to prevent the flu because they have been exposed to the 
virus should continue to feed their baby at the breast as long as they do not 
have symptoms of the flu such as fever, cough, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>.</p>.<p>Yes. One of the best things you can do for your sick baby is keep 
breastfeeding. </p>
