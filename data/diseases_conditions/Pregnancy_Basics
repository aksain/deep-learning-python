But many women are surprised by the other body changes that pop up.

Find out what you can do to feel better.</p>.<p><b><a name="body_aches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As your uterus expands, you may feel aches and pains in the back, abdomen, groin area, and thighs. Many women also have backaches and aching near the pelvic bone due the pressure of the baby's head, increased weight, and loosening joints. Some pregnant women complain of pain that runs from the lower back, down the back of one leg, to the knee or foot. This is called sciatica (SYE-AT-ick-uh). It is thought to occur when the uterus puts pressure on the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sciatica_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sciatic nerve</a>.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p>Call the doctor if the pain does not get better.</p>.<p><b><a name="breast_changes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A woman's breasts increase in size and fullness during pregnancy. As the due date approaches, hormone changes will cause your breasts to get even bigger to prepare for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breastfeeding</a>. Your breasts may feel full, heavy, or tender.</p>.<p>In the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/third_trimester_32_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">third trimester</a>, some pregnant women begin to leak colostrum (coh-LOSS-truhm) from their breasts. Colostrum is the first milk that your breasts produce for the baby. It is a thick, yellowish fluid containing antibodies that protect newborns from infection.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p>Tell your doctor if you feel a lump or have 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nipple changes</a> or discharge (that is not colostrum) or skin changes.</p>.<p><b><a name="constipation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many pregnant women complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a>. Signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation_myths_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">constipation</a> include having hard, dry stools; fewer than three bowel movements per week; and painful bowel movements.</p>.<p>Higher levels of hormones due to pregnancy slow down <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a> and relax muscles in the bowels leaving many women constipated. Plus, the pressure of the expanding uterus on the bowels can contribute to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">constipation</a>.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p>Tell your doctor if constipation does not go away.</p>.<p><b><a name="fatigue_sleep_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During your pregnancy, you might feel tired even after you've had a lot of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>. Many women find they're exhausted in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">first trimester</a>. Don't worry, this is normal! This is your body's way of telling you that you need more rest. In the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/second_trimester_16_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">second trimester</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tiredness</a> is usually replaced with a feeling of well being and energy. But in the third trimester, exhaustion often sets in again. As you get larger, sleeping may become more difficult. The baby's movements, bathroom runs, and an increase in the body's metabolism might interrupt or disturb your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a>. Leg cramping can also interfere with a good night's sleep.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p><b><a name="heartburn_and_indigestion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hormones and the pressure of the growing uterus cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a> and heartburn. Pregnancy hormones slow down the muscles of the digestive tract. So food tends to move more slowly and digestion is sluggish. This causes many pregnant women to feel bloated.</p>.<p>Hormones also relax the valve that separates the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> from the stomach. This allows food and acids to come back up from the stomach to the esophagus. The food and acid causes the burning feeling of heartburn. As your baby gets bigger, the uterus pushes on the stomach making heartburn more common in later pregnancy.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p>Call the doctor if symptoms don't improve after trying these suggestions. Ask your doctor about using an antacid.</p>.<p><b><a name="hemorrhoids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemorrhoids_piles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Hemorrhoids</a> (HEM-roidz) are swollen and bulging veins in the rectum.

During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly, which can cause veins to enlarge. The expanding uterus also puts pressure on the veins in the rectum. Plus, constipation can worsen hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids usually improve after delivery.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p><b><a name="leg_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>At different times during your pregnancy, you might have sudden <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle spasms</a> in your legs or feet.

Morning sickness usually tapers off by the second trimester.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p>Contact your doctor if you have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a>-like symptoms, which may signal a more serious condition.</p>.<p>You have severe, constant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a> several times every day.</p>.<p><b><a name="swelling" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many women develop mild swelling in the face, hands, or ankles at some point in their pregnancies.

Your unborn baby pushes down on the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles.

This can cause veins to enlarge. Plus, pressure on the large veins behind the uterus causes the blood to slow in its return to the heart. For these reasons, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/varicose_veins/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">varicose veins</a> in the legs and anus (hemorrhoids) are more common in pregnancy.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spider_and_varicose_veins_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Varicose veins</a> look like swollen veins raised above the surface of the skin.

Most often they appear on the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, and breasts. These <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scars</a> are caused by the stretching of the skin, and usually appear in the second half of pregnancy.</p>.<p>Some women notice other skin changes during pregnancy. For many women, the nipples become darker and browner during pregnancy. Many pregnant women also develop a dark line (called the linea nigra) on the skin that runs from the belly button down to the pubic hairline. Patches of darker skin usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip also are common. Patches often match on both sides of the face. These spots are called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melasma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">melasma</a> or chloasma and are more common in darker-skinned women.</p>.<p>What might help:</p>.<p><b><a name="nasal_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nosebleed/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Nosebleeds</a> and nasal stuffiness are common during pregnancy.
