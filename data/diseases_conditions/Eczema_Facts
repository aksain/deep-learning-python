<p><b><a name="eczema_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_eczema" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rather than a specific health condition, eczema is a reaction pattern that the skin produces in a number of diseases. It begins as red, raised tiny <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blisters</a> containing a clear fluid atop red, elevated plaques. When the blisters break, the affected skin will weep and ooze. In older eczema, chronic eczema, the blisters are less prominent and the skin is thickened, elevated, and scaling.

In order to develop a rational treatment plan, it is important to distinguish them. This is often not easy.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_eczema_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Almost all patients with eczema complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>. Since the appearance of most types of eczema is similar, elevated plaques of red, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumpy</a> skin, the distribution of the eruption can be of great help in distinguishing one type from another. For example, stasis dermatitis occurs most often on the lower leg while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">atopic dermatitis</a> occurs in the front of the elbow and behind the knee.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_treat_eczema" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eczema often is treated by family physicians, but since there are many causes of eczema, it may be necessary to seek help from a health specialist if things are not improving. Most dermatologists specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of all forms of eczema.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_eczema" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An accurate diagnosis requires an examination of the entire skin surface and a careful health history. It is important for a doctor to rule out curable conditions caused by infectious organisms. Occasionally, a sample of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">skin (biopsy)</a> may be sent for examination in a laboratory.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_eczema" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of acute eczema where there is significant weeping and oozing requires repeated cycles of application of dilute solutions of vinegar or tap water often in the form of a compress followed by evaporation. This is most often conveniently performed by placing the affected body part in front of a fan after the compress. Once the acute weeping has diminished, then topical steroid (such as triamcinolone cream) applications can be an effective treatment. In extensive disease, systemic steroids may need to be utilized either orally or by an injection (shot).<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_home_remedies_for_eczema" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mild eczema may respond to compresses composed of tepid water followed by room air evaporation.

This is because the normal barrier function of the skin has been damaged by the inflammatory condition. In this situation, the infection could be contagious and require antibiotics treatment.
