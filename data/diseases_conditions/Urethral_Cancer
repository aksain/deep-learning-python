In women, the urethra is about 1½ inches long and is just above the vagina. In men, the urethra is about 8 inches long, and goes through the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">prostate gland</a> and the penis to the outside of the body. In men, the urethra also carries semen.</p>.<p>Urethral cancer is a rare cancer that occurs more often in women than in men.</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_urethral_cancer_that_begin_in_cells_that_line_the_urethra" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancers</a> are named for the types of cells that become malignant (cancer):</p>.<p>Urethral cancer can <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasize</a> (spread) quickly to tissues around the urethra and is often found in nearby <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lymph nodes</a> by the time it is diagnosed.</p>.<p><b><a name="a_history_of_bladder_cancer_can_affect_the_risk_of_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for urethral cancer include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_of_urethral_cancer_include_bleeding_or_trouble_with_urination" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by urethral cancer or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="tests_that_examine_the_urethra_and_bladder_are_used_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used:</p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_%0Aand_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="after_urethral_cancer_has_been_diagnosed_tests_are_done_to_find_out_if_cancer_cells_have_spread_within_the_urethra_or_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the urethra or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.</p>.<p>The following procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p><b>There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.</b></p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p><b>Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.</b></p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if urethral cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually urethral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic urethral cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b>Urethral cancer is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected.</b></p>.<p>Urethral cancer is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected and how deeply the tumor has spread into tissue around the urethra. Urethral cancer can be described as distal or proximal.</p>.<p><b>Distal urethral cancer</b></p>.<p>In distal urethral cancer, the cancer usually has not spread deeply into the tissue. In women, the part of the urethra that is closest to the outside of the body (about ½ inch) is affected. In men, the part of the urethra that is in the penis is affected.</p>.<p><b>Proximal urethral cancer</b></p>.<p>Proximal urethral cancer affects the part of the urethra that is not the distal urethra. In women and men, proximal urethral cancer usually has spread deeply into tissue.</p>.<p><b>Bladder and/or prostate cancer may occur at the same time as urethral cancer.</b></p>.<p>In men, cancer that forms in the proximal urethra (the part of the urethra that passes through the prostate to the bladder) may occur at the same time as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer of the bladder</a> and/or prostate. Sometimes this occurs at diagnosis and sometimes it occurs later.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="recurrent_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recurrent urethral cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the urethra or in other parts of the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatments are available for patients with urethral cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p><b>Four types of standard treatment are used:</b></p>.<p>Surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for cancer of the urethra. One of the following types of surgery may be done:</p>.<p>If the urethra is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for the urine to pass from the body. This is called urinary diversion. If the bladder is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for urine to be stored and passed from the body. The surgeon may use part of the small intestine to make a tube that passes urine through an opening (stoma). This is called an ostomy or urostomy. If a patient has an ostomy, a disposable bag to collect urine is worn under clothing. The surgeon may also use part of the small intestine to make a new storage pouch (continent reservoir) inside the body where the urine can collect. A tube (catheter) is then used to drain the urine through a stoma.</p>.<p>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat urethral cancer.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra.</p>.<p>Active surveillance is following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including biopsies, on a regular schedule.</p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="distal_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of abnormal cells in the mucosa (inside lining of the urethra that have not become cancer, may include surgery to remove the tumor (open excision or transurethral resection), electroresection with fulguration, or laser surgery.</p>.<p>Treatment of distal urethral cancer is different for men and women.</p>.<p>For women, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p>For men, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="proximal_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of proximal urethral cancer or urethral cancer that affects the entire urethra is different for men and women.</p>.<p>For women, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p>For men, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of urethral cancer that forms at the same time as invasive bladder cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>If the urethra is not removed during surgery to remove the bladder, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="metastatic_or_recurrent_urethral_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of urethral cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body) is usually chemotherapy.</p>.<p>Treatment of recurrent urethral cancer may include one or more of the following:</p>
