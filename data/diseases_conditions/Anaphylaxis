<p><b><a name="anaphylaxis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing and serious allergic reaction that can affect multiple body systems at the same time. Severe anaphylactic reactions can be fatal. Anaphylaxis is often triggered by substances to which people have an allergy that are injected or ingested and thereby gain access into the bloodstream. This can result in a reaction involving the skin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, nose, throat, and gastrointestinal tract and can culminate in life-threatening anaphylactic shock.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_history_of_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To fully understand this term, we need to go back almost 100 years. The story begins on a cruise aboard Prince Albert I of Monaco's yacht. The prince had invited two Parisian scientists to perform studies on the toxin produced by the tentacles of a local jellyfish, the Portuguese Man of War. Charles Richet and Paul Portier were able to isolate the toxin and tried to vaccinate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puppies_and_dogs_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">dogs</a> in the hope of obtaining protection, or "prophylaxis," against the toxin. They were horrified to find that subsequent very small doses of the toxin unexpectedly resulted in a new dramatic illness that involved the rapid onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> difficulty and resulted in death within 30 minutes. Richet and Portier termed this "anaphylaxis" or "against protection." They rightly concluded that the immune system first becomes sensitized to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergen</a> over several weeks and upon reexposure to the same allergen may result in a severe reaction. An allergen is a substance that is foreign to the body and can cause an allergic reaction in certain people.</p>.<p>Richet went on to suggest that the allergen must result in the production of a substance, which then sensitized the dogs to react in such a way upon reexposure. This substance turned out to be IgE.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_common_causes_of_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The major causes of allergy and anaphylaxis include medications, foods, drugs, latex, and insect bites or stings (wasps, yellow jackets, hornets, honeybees, and fire ants), and latex. The causes of anaphylaxis are divided into two major groups:</p>.<p><b>IgE-mediated or immunologic anaphylaxis</b>: This form requires an initial sensitizing exposure (an exposure to the substance that will later trigger the anaphylaxis) and then occurs on a subsequent exposure. It involves the coating of mast cells and basophils (cells in the blood and tissue that secrete mediators, the substances that cause allergic reactions) by an antibody called IgE, and the subsequent release of chemical mediators upon re-exposure. IgE-mediated anaphylaxis can occur with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">food allergies</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a> to drugs, latex, and insect stings. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Food allergy</a> is estimated to cause up to half of emergency department visits for anaphylaxis in developed countries. Although it may appear that IgE-mediated anaphylaxis occurs upon a first exposure to a food, drug, or insect sting, there must have been a prior sensitization from a previous exposure, which is often unknown. One may not remember an uneventful sting. The previous exposure to a food may not be recalled; it may occur in utero, through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breast milk</a>, or through the skin, particularly in individuals with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atopic_dermatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atopic dermatitis</a>).</p>.<p><b>Non-IgE-mediated or nonimmunologic anaphylaxis</b>: These reactions have the same symptoms as true anaphylaxis but do not require an IgE immune reaction. They are usually caused by the direct stimulation of the mast cells and basophils. In the past, they have been termed "anaphylactoid reactions." The same mediators are released as with IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and the same effects are produced. This reaction can happen on initial, as well as subsequent, exposures, since no sensitization is required. This type of reaction usually occurs with medications. A common cause of a non-IgE-mediated reaction is IV contrast used in imaging studies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_anaphylaxis_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anaphylaxis often affects two or more body systems, or it may present with just <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypotension</a>), which usually occurs with a severe reaction.

Uncontrolled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a> is a consistent risk factor for severe anaphylaxis and fatal anaphylaxis.

The key differences are that in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fainting</a> episode, the affected person typically has a slow pulse, cool and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pale_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">pale skin</a>, and no hives or difficulty breathing. Other conditions, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> to the lungs (pulmonary embolus), septic shock, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/panic_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">panic attacks</a> can also be confused with anaphylaxis.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis and is usually diagnosed by the patterns of symptoms listed above. If someone thinks he or she is having an anaphylactic reaction, the first and most important step is to treat with self-injectable epinephrine and/or seek emergency care. Once the acute reaction has been treated with epinephrine, one must seek urgent medical care to monitor for the risk of a biphasic reaction. Referral to an allergist is also typically recommended. The allergist will assess whether or not the reaction was indeed allergic in nature. Sometimes, a careful and detailed medical history and selected blood or skin tests can identify the trigger. The medical history focuses on exposures such as foods, medications, and stings preceding the anaphylactic reaction. In rare cases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> or alcohol may be a factor in anaphylaxis.</p>.<p><b>Exercise-induced anaphylaxis</b>: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Exercise</a>-induced anaphylaxis is a rare condition that presents with the same symptoms as anaphylaxis but is triggered by exercise. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is often food-dependent in which symptoms occur with exercise only after consuming specific foods, such as celery, wheat, alcohol, or shellfish. Early symptoms are usually flushing and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a>, which may progress to other typical symptoms of anaphylaxis if the exercise continues. Premedication with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a> or other drugs does not consistently prevent EIA. Warming up slowly, avoiding eating two to four hours before exercise, exercising with a partner, and carrying emergency epinephrine kits is mandatory for those at risk for exercise-induced anaphylaxis. If symptoms occur despite these measures, then exercise avoidance may be recommended.</p>.<p>When no cause can be found for anaphylaxis, it is termed idiopathic. Recent reports suggest that 25% of all episodes of anaphylaxis are idiopathic. For frequent episodes of anaphylaxis, a physician may recommend a combination of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamine</a>, leukotriene inhibitors, or oral steroids to reduce the severity of attacks. There is also some evidence that a biologic medication, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omalizumab/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">omalizumab</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omalizumab/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Xolair</a>), which binds IgE, may help with idiopathic anaphylaxis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="recommendations_after_an_initial_episode_of_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who have experienced anaphylaxis of any cause should be educated about their trigger(s) and the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Those at risk for anaphylaxis should carry an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epinephrine_auto-injector/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">epinephrine auto-injector</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epinephrine_auto-injector/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">EpiPen</a>, Adrenaclick) and understand when and how to use it. A wrist bracelet indicating the risk and trigger(s) for anaphylaxis can be helpful. Allergic diseases are often treated by avoidance measures, which will be reviewed in detail below.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_emergency_measures_used_in_the_treatment_of_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you suspect that you or someone you are with is having an anaphylactic reaction, the following are important <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">first aid</a> measures. In general, try to perform these in the order that they are presented.</p>.<p>After the initial epinephrine dose, if the symptoms are returning or still significant, one can inject another dose of epinephrine if available. All self-injectable epinephrine devices come in a two-pack for this reason. Even if anaphylaxis responds to epinephrine, a person should be monitored in an emergency care setting. Steroids and antihistamines may be given, but these are not helpful in the initial management of anaphylaxis, and should not take the place of epinephrine. Steroids may be most helpful to prevent a biphasic reaction.</p>.<p>The normal side effects of epinephrine include pallor, shakiness, a rapid heart rate, and a sense of doom. These symptoms resolve rapidly, typically within minutes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) is the first-line therapy for anaphylaxis. It acts to reverse the effects of anaphylaxis on all body systems. Its effects include the following:</p>.<p><b>Skin</b>: improves itching and hives</p>.<p><b>Respiratory</b>: relaxes bronchial tubes in lungs, thus improving shortness of breath, chest tightness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cough</a></p>.<p><b>Gastrointestinal</b>: diminishes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abdominal pain</a>, cramping, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a></p>.<p><b>Cardiovascular</b>: constricts blood vessels, thus improving <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a></p>.<p>Epinephrine also helps prevent the release of more mediators of the allergic reaction. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Diphenhydramine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Benadryl</a>) is not first-line therapy for anaphylaxis. This has primary effects on improving skin symptoms, such as hives and itching. In cases of severe anaphylaxis, in addition to epinephrine, other medications, IV fluids, and oxygen are administered once one receives care from a health care professional. The choice of interventions will depend on the severity of the reaction.</p>.<p>Anaphylaxis may be biphasic roughly 20%-30% of the time. This is also known as a "late-phase reaction." In biphasic anaphylaxis, symptoms improve but then return hours to even days later. Treatment for biphasic reactions is the same as treatment of initial anaphylactic reactions. It is thought that steroids might reduce the risk of a biphasic reaction.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Preventing anaphylaxis is the ideal form of treatment. However, that may not always be easy since insect stings are frequently unanticipated, and allergens in foods may be ingested by mistake. A consultation with an allergist is vital in helping one identify the trigger(s) and providing information and instruction on how to best avoid them. The affected individual will learn how to use emergency kits and how to become prepared for any reaction in the future.</p>.<p>These are situations in which preventive treatment might be offered by the allergist.</p>.<p>Since avoidance is not fail-safe, a person at risk for an anaphylactic reaction must be adequately prepared in an emergency to handle a reaction. It is recommended that everyone at risk carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen or Adrenaclick).</p>.<p>Here are some important points to remember regarding self- injectable epinephrine:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_anaphylaxis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for poor outcomes from anaphylaxis include delayed treatment with epinephrine and a history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">asthma</a>, particularly uncontrolled asthma. In the community, the most common causes of poor outcomes are stinging-insect allergy in adults and a history of peanut and tree nut allergy. Death from anaphylaxis from these causes is usually associated with delayed treatment with epinephrine. If recognized and treated promptly with epinephrine, the prognosis for anaphylaxis is generally good and the vast majority of patients experience a full recovery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
