<p><b><a name="chronic_bronchitis_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_bronchitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bronchitis is a term that describes inflammation of the bronchial tubes (bronchi and the smaller branches termed bronchioles) that results in excessive secretions of mucus into the tubes, leading to tissue swelling that can narrow or close off bronchial tubes. Bronchial tubes extend from the trachea and terminate at the alveoli in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>. The bronchial system resembles an inverted tree and is sometimes termed the "bronchial tree." A few authors include the trachea and upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">airway</a> in the definition of bronchitis.</p>.<p>There are two major types of bronchitis, acute and chronic. Chronic bronchitis differs from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_acute/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acute bronchitis</a> in several ways, for example, pathology, progression of disease, major causes, treatments, and prognosis. Recurrent incidences of acute bronchitis are the first steps that can lead to developing chronic bronchitis, according to some doctors and researchers.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_acute_bronchitis_what_are_the__symptoms_of_acute_bronchitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Acute bronchitis is bronchitis that is short-lived. Acute bronchitis lasts about two weeks, and usually people recover with no permanent damage to the bronchial tree. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Viruses</a> such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">influenza</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/respiratory_syncytial_virus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">respiratory syncytial virus</a> (RSV), and rhinoviruses cause the majority of cases of acute bronchitis, while the remainder are caused by bacteria (for example, <em>Mycoplasma, Pneumococcus</em>) or short-term exposure to chemical irritants (for example, tobacco smoke, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acid reflux</a>, inhaled solvents).</p>.<p>Symptoms of acute bronchitis may include:</p>.<p>Some people may cough up phlegm.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_chronic_bronchitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chronic bronchitis is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts for at least 3 months, two years in a row. This definition was developed to help select uniform patient populations for research purposes, for example, to study medication therapies for treatment of chronic bronchitis.</p>.<p>Many of the bronchi develop chronic inflammation with swelling and excess mucus production. The inflammation causes a change in the lining cells of the airways to varying degrees. Many cells that line the airway lose the function of their cilia (hair-like appendages that are capable of beating rapidly), and eventually the ciliated cells are lost. Cilia perform the function of moving particles and fluid (usually mucus) over the lining surface in such structures as the trachea, bronchial tubes, and nasal cavities to keep these hollow structures clear of particles and fluids. These ciliated cells that help in clearance of secretions are often replaced by so-called goblet cells. This group of cells secretes mucus into the airway. The warm moist environment of the airway along with the nutrients in the mucus is an excellent medium for growing bacteria. The mucus often becomes infected and discolored from the bacterial overgrowth and the body's inflammatory response to it. The inflammation, swelling, and mucus frequently and significantly inhibit the airflow to and from the lung alveoli by narrowing and partially obstructing the bronchi and bronchioles.</p>.<p>The muscles that surround the some of the airways can be stimulated by this airway irritation. This muscular spasm also known as bronchospasm can result in further airway narrowing. With long-standing inflammation, as can be seen in chronic bronchitis, this muscular spasm and inflammation results in a fixed, nonreversible narrowing of the airway and the condition is termed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">COPD</a>). Chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a> develops as the body attempts to open and clear the bronchial airways of particles and mucus or as an overreaction to ongoing inflammation. Chronic bronchitis can be a progressive disease; symptoms (listed below) increase over time. Some NIH investigators consider chronic bronchitis a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">COPD</a>.</p>.<p>COPD also includes the entities of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/emphysema_lung_condition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emphysema</a>, chronic bronchitis, and chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthma</a>. These conditions are not always separable and patients often have components of each. In the case of chronic bronchitis, the fixed airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and retained secretions can result in a mismatch of blood flow and airflow in the lungs. This can impair oxygenation of the blood as well as removal of the waste product, carbon dioxide.</p>.<p>Although people of any age can develop chronic bronchitis, the majority of people diagnosed with the disease are 45 years of age or older.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_chronic_bronchitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The major signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis are:</p>.<p>Other signs and symptoms that may accompany chronic bronchitis include</p>.<p>Exacerbation of chronic bronchitis occurs when symptoms worsen or become more frequent. These exacerbations often require antibiotics, and may need steroid medication and an increase in respiratory inhaled medications. Signs and symptoms of exacerbation of chronic bronchitis include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_chronic_bronchitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many causes of chronic bronchitis, but the main cause is cigarette smoke. Statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that about 49% of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smokers</a> develop chronic bronchitis and 24% develop emphysema/COPD.</p>.<p>The major risk factor for individuals to develop chronic bronchitis is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">tobacco smoking</a> and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure.

A history of a daily productive (sputum production) cough that lasts at least 3 months, especially if has occurred two years in a row, fits the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. The physical examination often allows health-care professionals to hear wheezes and a prolongation of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">exhalation</a> of breathing, which are signs of airflow obstruction.</p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a> is often performed to help rule out other lung problems (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a>, bronchial obstructions). Additional tests such as a complete blood count (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>), arterial blood gas measurements, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> of the chest, and pulmonary function tests are often done to characterize the structure and function of the lungs and to help exclude other conditions (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a>, lung infections). Often a pulmonologist (a physician with specialized training in the management of lung diseases) can help diagnose and treat chronic bronchitis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_chronic_bronchitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For the majority of cases, the initial treatment is simple to prescribe but frequently ignored or rejected by the patient – stop smoking cigarettes and avoid second-hand tobacco smoke. People should be encouraged in every way to cease smoking, as continuation will only cause further lung damage. Similarly, blocking or removing other underlying causes of repeated bronchial irritation (for example, exposure to chemical fumes) is a treatment goal. Half of patients with chronic bronchitis who smoke will no longer cough after 1 month of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking cessation</a>.</p>.<p>Two major classes of medications are used to treat chronic bronchitis, bronchodilators, and steroids.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_treat_chronic_bronchitis_what_are_other_medical_treatments" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>PDE4 inhibitors</b> are a class of anti-inflammatory agents for certain exacerbations of COPD. They are primarily for exacerbations that involve excessive bronchitis and mucus production. There is currently only one agent available called roflumilast (Daliresp), a pill taken once per day.</p>.<p><b>Antibiotics:</b> Occasionally, antibiotics are used to treat chronic bronchitis exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often the choice. Examples include:</p>.<p>Of course, if a culture is obtained, directed therapy at the specific offending organism is always best.</p>.<p><strong><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Over-the-counter</a> (OTC)</strong> cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan (for example, Pertussin, Vicks 44 or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dextromethorphan-oral_liquid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Benylin</a>) may be helpful in reducing cough symptoms.

Most patients will no longer cough with continued abstinence from smoking. If airflow obstruction has occurred, this can improve but the improvement level depends on the duration of injury and the compliance with therapy. Obviously, the more impaired patients will have a lesser recovery of lung function.</p>.<p>Conversely, those individuals that have continued bronchial irritation have only a fair to poor prognosis, since repeated bouts with the disease usually get worse, with affected individuals having more frequent incidents of coughing and dyspnea over time and further progression of lung function abnormalities.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_chronic_bronchitis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of instances of chronic bronchitis can be prevented by not smoking and avoiding <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">second-hand smoke</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Flu</a> and pneumococcal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> can help prevent repeated infections that may lead to the disease.</p>.<p>Certain industries (for example, chemical, textile, and farm workers) are often associated with air-borne chemicals and dust; avoiding air-borne chemicals and dust with appropriate masks may prevent or reduce the individual's chance of developing chronic bronchitis.</p>.<p>Good control of asthma may prevent chronic bronchitis from developing.
