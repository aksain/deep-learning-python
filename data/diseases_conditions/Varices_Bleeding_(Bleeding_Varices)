<p><b><a name="introduction_to_bleeding_varacies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Varices are dilated blood vessels usually in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a> or stomach. They cause no symptoms unless they rupture and bleed.

Bleeding from varices is a life-threatening complication of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/portal_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">portal hypertension</a>. Portal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> is an increase in the pressure within the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a>) due to blockage of blood flow throughout the liver.</p>.<p>This increased pressure in the portal vein causes the development of large, swollen veins (varices) within the esophagus and stomach. The varices are fragile and can rupture easily, resulting in a large amount of blood loss.

The most common cause of portal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> is 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cirrhosis</a> of the liver. Cirrhosis is scarring which accompanies the healing of liver injury caused by 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis</a>, alcohol, or other less common causes of liver damage. In cirrhosis, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scar tissue</a> blocks the flow of blood through the liver and slows its processing functions.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_bleeding_varices" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of bleeding varices include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_bleeding_varices_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bleeding from varices is a medical emergency and treatment should be immediate. If the bleeding is not controlled quickly, a person may go into shock or die. In severe cases, a person may need to be placed temporarily on a ventilator to prevent the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> from filling with blood. Aside from the urgent need to stop the bleeding, treatment is also aimed at preventing future bleeding. Procedures that help treat bleeding varices include:</p>.<p><b><a name="can_bleeding_varices_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treating the underlying cause of bleeding varices can help prevent their recurrence and treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a> earlier on may prevent their development. Certain medications including the class of heart <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> called "beta-blockers" may reduce elevated portal pressure and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Long acting nitroglycerines are also used for this purpose.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
