<p><b><a name="toca" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Deep brain stimulation (or DBS) is a way to inactivate parts of the brain that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a> and its associated symptoms without purposefully destroying the brain. In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are placed in the thalamus (to treat essential tremor and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a>) or in the globus pallidus (for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a>).</p>.<p>In deep brain stimulation electrodes are connected by wires to a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pacemaker/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pacemaker</a> device (called an impulse generator, or IPG) implanted under the skin of the chest, below the collarbone. Once activated, the device sends continuous electrical pulses to the target areas in the brain, blocking the impulses that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>. This has the same effect as thalamotomy or pallidotomy surgeries without actually destroying parts of the brain.</p>.<p>The IPG can easily be programmed using a computer that sends radio signals to the device. Patients are given special magnets or other devices so they can externally turn the IPG on or off.</p>.<p>Depending on use, the stimulators may last three to five years. The IPG replacement procedure is relatively simple.</p>.<p>

Most people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a> will require the surgery be done on both sides of the brain. During the first surgery, the electrodes are placed into the brain, but left unconnected.</p>.<p>There are several ways in which the electrodes are placed into the target areas of the brain. First these areas must be located. One way to locate the target areas is to rely only on a 
computed tomography (CT) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>) scan. While some surgeons stop there, others use an electrode recording technique to map and target the specific areas that they will need to reach.</p>.<p>Once the correct location is identified, the permanent electrodes are implanted. The loose ends are placed underneath the skin of the head and the incision is closed with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sutures</a>. The patient receives general anesthesia for the placement of the impulse generator in the chest and the positioning of extension wires that connect the electrodes to the impulse generators. It may take a few weeks until the simulators and medications are adjusted sufficiently for patients receive adequate symptom relief. But, overall, DBS causes very few side effects.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocj" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Subthalamic nucleus stimulation is a new application of the original deep brain stimulation technique. After extensive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">clinical trials</a>, stimulation of the part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus has been recognized as the most effective surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease, addressing not only <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>, but the full range of the disease's symptoms, including: rigidity, slowness of movement, stiffness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a> concerns.</p>.<p>Successful stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus allows patients to consistently reduce their medication while improving all of their other disease-related symptoms. In addition, the surgery to place the stimulator in the subthalamic nucleus is generally easier than surgeries for the thalamus or globus pallidus.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="tocd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Deep brain stimulation has many advantages.</p>.<p>Possible Disadvantages:</p>.<p><b><a name="toce" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>With deep brain stimulation, the vast majority of people (over 70%) experience a significant improvement of all their symptoms related to Parkinson's disease. Most people are able to significantly reduce their medications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="tocz" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is effective for all major symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremor, slowness of movement, rigidity, and problems with walking and balance. People bothered by involuntary movements such as dyskinesia often experience a marked reduction of these involuntary movements primarily because they are able to reduce their medications following surgery.</p>.<p>Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus is effective for a wide range of Parkinson's symptoms. It seems to be somewhat less effective for problems with walking and balance. Also, patients remain on the same average dose of medications following surgery.</p>.<p>Deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is only effective for tremor and rigidity. Consequently, deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is usually not performed for patients with Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocf" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As with any surgical procedure, there are risks. There is a 2%-3% risk of a serious and permanent complication such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">paralysis</a>, changes in thinking, memory and personality, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a>, and infection. Talk to your doctor to see if these risks apply to you.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocx" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No. Deep brain stimulation is not experimental. DBS of the thalamus was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor in 1997. But, since stimulation of the thalamus is only effective for treating tremor and rigidity symptoms, it is not recommended for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This is because even if a person currently only has tremor or rigidity, he or she will eventually develop other symptoms that would only be helped by stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus. Therefore, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus is recommended.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="tocg" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many important issues to be addressed when considering deep brain stimulation. These issues should be discussed with a movement disorders expert or a specially trained neurologist. A movement disorders expert is someone who has trained specifically in movement disorders.</p>.<p>One of the most important criteria is that the person has had an adequate trial of medications. Surgery is not recommended if medications can adequately control the disease. However, surgery should be considered for people who do not achieve satisfactory control with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>. Talk to your doctor to see if DBS is right for you.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Deep brain stimulation has been successful in treating people of different ages. However, each person should be assessed individually as to their stamina and overall health before considering surgery.</p>.<p><b><a name="toch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first and most important recommendation is that the deep brain stimulation procedure be performed in a place where there is a multi-disciplinary team of experts. This means neurologists, neurosurgeons, and neurophysiologists who have experience and specialized training in performing these types of surgeries.</p>.<p>The next important consideration is how the surgery is done. Different centers may perform the procedure in different ways. It is very important to ask how the target (the thalamus or globus pallidus) is targeted. It is clear that the chances of benefit and the risks of complications are directly related to how close the electrode is to the correct target.</p>.<p><b><a name="tocw" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You will remain awake during most of the deep brain stimulation procedure. This allows the surgical team to interact with you when testing the effects of the stimulation. Small amounts of local anesthetic (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>-relieving medication) are given in sensitive areas. The vast majority of people experience minimal discomfort during the procedure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="tocq" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may feel tired and sore but will be given medication and kept comfortable after your deep brain stimulation procedure. Also, you may have irritation or soreness around the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stitches</a> and pin sites.</p>.<p>As with any surgery, there are some guidelines and limitations that you should follow after DBS. Be sure to discuss these with your doctor and ask questions before surgery. Understanding what you will be experiencing and knowing what to expect afterward can help ease some of the natural <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> that comes with any medical procedure.</p>.<p><b><a name="toct" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The average hospital stay for the first part of the deep brain stimulation surgery is two to three days. For the second part of the surgery one week later, you will be in the hospital for less than 24 hours.</p>.<p><b><a name="toci" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="tocv" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="tocr" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after deep brain stimulation surgery:</p>.<p><b><a name="tocs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While you should be able to use most electronic devices, you should be aware that:</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
