</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_kidneys" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your kidneys are a pair of organs in your abdomen. Each kidney is about the size of a fist.</p>.<p>Your kidneys are part of the urinary tract. They make urine by removing wastes and extra water from your blood.</p>.<p>Urine collects in a hollow space (renal pelvis) in the middle of each kidney. Urine passes from your renal pelvis into your bladder through a long tube called a ureter. Urine leaves your bladder through a shorter tube (the urethra).</p>.<p>Your kidneys also make substances to help control <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a> and to make <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red blood cells</a>.</p>.<p>Attached to the top of each kidney is an adrenal gland. A layer of fatty tissue and an outer layer of fibrous tissue surround the kidney and adrenal gland.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the kidneys and the other organs of the body.</p>.<p>Normal cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</p>.<p>Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor.</p>.<p>Tumors in the kidney can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign tumors are not as harmful as malignant tumors:</p>.<p>Kidney cancer cells can spread by breaking away from the kidney tumor. They can travel through lymph vessels to nearby <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lymph nodes</a>. They can also spread through blood vessels to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, bones, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>. After spreading, kidney cancer cells may attach to other tissues and grow to form new tumors that may damage those tissues.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_kidney_cancer_causes_and_risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When you get a diagnosis of kidney cancer, it's natural to wonder what may have caused the disease. Doctors usually can't explain why one person gets kidney cancer and another doesn't.</p>.<p>However, we do know that people with certain risk factors may be more likely than others to develop kidney cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.</p>.<p>Studies have found the following risk factors for kidney cancer:</p>.<p>Many people who get kidney cancer have none of these risk factors, and many people who have known risk factors don't develop the disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_kidney_cancer_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Common symptoms of kidney cancer include:</p>.<p>These symptoms may be caused by kidney cancer or by other health problems, such as an infection or a kidney <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cyst</a>. People with these symptoms should tell their doctor so that any problem can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_kidney_cancer_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have symptoms that suggest kidney cancer, your doctor will try to find out what's causing the problems.</p>.<p>You may have a physical exam. Also, you may have one or more of the following tests:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_kidney_cancer_staging_determined" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If kidney cancer is diagnosed, your doctor needs to learn the extent (stage) of the disease to help you choose the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the kidney tumor and whether the cancer has invaded nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body.</p>.<p>Your doctor may order one or more tests:</p>.<p>When cancer spreads from its original place to another part of the body, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells and the same name as the primary (original) tumor. For example, if kidney cancer spreads to a lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually kidney cancer cells. The disease is metastatic kidney cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>. It's treated as kidney cancer, not as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lung cancer</a>. Doctors sometimes call the new tumor “distant” disease.</p>.<p>These are the stages of kidney cancer:</p>.<p>Common treatment options for people with kidney cancer are surgery, targeted therapy, and biological therapy. You may receive more than one type of treatment.</p>.<p>The treatment that's right for you depends mainly on the following:</p>.<p>You may have a team of specialists to help plan your treatment. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral.</p>.<p>You may want to see a urologist, a surgeon who specializes in treating problems of the urinary tract. Other specialists who treat kidney cancer include urologic oncologists (surgeons who specialize in cancers of the urinary tract), medical oncologists, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">radiation</a> oncologists. Your health care team may also include an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">oncology</a> nurse and a registered dietitian.</p>.<p>Your health care team can describe your treatment choices, the expected results of each, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs.</p>.<p>At any stage of disease, supportive care is available to control pain and other symptoms, to relieve the side effects of treatment, and to ease emotional concerns. Information about such care is available on NCI's Web site at http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping. For example, some people with kidney cancer may need to have radiation therapy to relieve pain or certain other problems. Radiation therapy uses highenergy rays to kill cancer cells.</p>.<p>You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Clinical trials</a> are research studies testing new treatments. They are an important option for people with all stages of kidney cancer.</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions before you begin treatment:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_kidney_cancer_treatments" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery is the most common treatment for people with kidney cancer. The type of surgery depends on the size and stage of the cancer, whether you have two kidneys, and whether cancer was found in both kidneys.</p>.<p>You and your surgeon can talk about the types of surgery and which may be right for you:</p>.<p>There are two approaches for removing the kidney. The surgeon may remove the tumor by making a large incision into your body (open surgery). Or the surgeon may remove the tumor by making small incisions (laparoscopic surgery). The surgeon sees inside your abdomen with a thin, lighted tube (a laparoscope) placed inside a small incision. Sometimes a robot is used. The surgeon uses handles below a computer display to control the robot's arms.</p>.<p>The surgeon may use other methods of destroying the cancer in the kidney. For people who have a tumor smaller than 4 centimeters and who can't have surgery to remove part of the kidney because of other health problems, the surgeon may suggest:</p>.<p>It takes time to heal after surgery, and the time needed to recover is different for each person. It's common to feel weak or tired for a while.</p>.<p>Also, you may have pain or discomfort for the first few days. Medicine can help control your pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your doctor or nurse. After surgery, your doctor can adjust the plan if you need more pain control.</p>.<p>Your health care team will watch you for signs of bleeding, infection, or other problems. They will keep track of how much fluid you take in and how much urine passes out of your body.</p>.<p>If one kidney is removed, the remaining kidney is usually able to do the work of both kidneys. However, if your remaining kidney isn't doing a good job cleaning your blood, you may need dialysis. Some people may need a transplant with a healthy kidney from a donor.</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions before having surgery:</p>.<p><b><a name="targeted_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with kidney cancer that has spread may receive a type of drug called targeted therapy. Many kinds of targeted therapy are used for kidney cancer. This treatment may shrink a kidney tumor or slow its growth.</p>.<p>Usually, the targeted therapy is taken by mouth. You may feel very tired while taking targeted therapy for kidney cancer. Other side effects may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a>, sores on the lips or in the mouth, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high blood pressure</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="biological_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with kidney cancer that has spread may receive biological therapy. Biological therapy for kidney cancer is a treatment that may improve the body's natural defense (the immune system response) against cancer. The treatments used for kidney cancer can slow the growth of tumors or shrink them. The biological therapy is injected intravenously or under the skin. The treatment may be given at the hospital or a doctor's office.</p>.<p>Other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> may be given at the same time to prevent side effects. The side effects differ with the biological therapy used, and from person to person. Biological therapy commonly causes a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a> or swelling. You may feel very tired during treatment. The treatment may also cause a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, muscle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">aches</a>, a fever, or weakness.</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions about targeted therapy or biological therapy:</p>.<p><b><a name="second_opinion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before starting treatment, you may want a second opinion about your diagnosis, stage of cancer, and treatment plan. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.</p>.<p>If you get a second opinion, the second doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at all of your options.</p>.<p>It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In most cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually will not make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor.</p>.<p>There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.</p>.<p><b><a name="nutrition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's important for you to take very good care of yourself before, during, and after cancer treatment. Taking care of yourself includes eating well so that you get the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.</p>.<p>Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of some treatments (such as poor appetite, nausea, or vomiting) can make it hard to eat well.</p>.<p>Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to help you meet your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">nutrition</a> needs.</p>.<p><b><a name="follow-up_care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You'll need regular checkups (such as every 6 months) after treatment for kidney cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed.</p>.<p>Kidney cancer may come back after treatment. Your doctor will check for return of cancer. Checkups may include blood tests, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest x-ray</a>, CT scans, or an ultrasound.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="sources_of_support" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Learning that you have kidney cancer can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that a diagnosis of cancer can bring.</p>.<p>Concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills are common. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities.</p>.<p>Here's where you can go for support:</p>.<p><b><a name="taking_part_in_cancer_research" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors all over the world are conducting many types of clinical trials (research studies in which people volunteer to take part). Clinical trials are designed to find out whether new treatments are safe and effective.</p>.<p>Even if the people in a trial do not benefit directly from a treatment, they may still make an important contribution by helping doctors learn more about kidney cancer and how to control it. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, doctors do all they can to protect their patients.</p>.<p>Doctors are studying new targeted therapies and drug combinations for kidney cancer. If you're interested in being part of a clinical trial, talk with your doctor.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
