This disorder often results in a man or woman having relationship problems, as well as difficulty performing well at work or in their community.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_adult_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While there is no one specific cause for ADHD, there are a number of biologically and socially based risk factors that can increase the likelihood of a person developing the illness. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Children with ADHD</a> are more likely to grow into <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a> and adults with the condition. Brain-imaging studies indicate that traits of the brains of people who have ADHD include a tendency to be smaller, to have less connection between certain areas of the brain, and have less regulation of the neurochemical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dopamine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dopamine</a> compared to people who do not have the disorder.</p>.<p>In addition to being risk factors for other neuropsychological issues, factors prior to birth that can increase the likelihood of developing ADHD include maternal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_during_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking during pregnancy</a>, prematurity and low birth weight, as well as an early life stressor in the individual with ADHD. Males and having a family history of this disorder increase the chances that a person will be diagnosed with ADHD. Low family income and low educational achievement for a person's father are social risk factors for developing ADHD.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_prevalent_is_adult_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although it is estimated that 2%-6% of adults have ADHD, this illness begins during childhood. While the condition is assessed more often in boys than in girls, it appears to occur in men and women at equal rates. Nearly two-thirds of children with ADHD retain some symptoms of the illness as adults, and about half have just as many symptoms of sufficient severity to still qualify for the diagnosis of ADHD. Other key statistics include that more than 90% of adults with the condition describe having trouble focusing, and more than 50% have both distractibility and hyperactivity/impulsivity, while more than one-third have just distractibility.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_adult_adhd_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>What is thought to be partly the result of maturity, adults with ADHD may show little to no signs of hyperactivity or the hyperactivity may look more like restlessness and a tendency to become bored easily. For those who do, symptoms and signs of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention may resemble those that are exhibited by children and teens. However, how those symptoms are exhibited tends to vary with age. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Symptoms of ADHD</a> include the following:</p>.<p>While excessive focus, often described as hyperfocus, is not included as a formal symptom of ADHD, it is often described by people who suffer from this condition or their family members. This symptom is thought by many to be a manifestation of the ineffective focus that is associated with this condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_do_health_care_professionals_use_to_diagnose_adult_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>According to the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</i> (<i>DSM-V</i>), in order to be diagnosed with ADHD, a child should exhibit six symptoms of inattention or six symptoms of combined hyperactivity and impulsivity, and an older teen or adult need only demonstrate five of each group of symptoms. Diagnostic criteria further state that symptoms should begin prior to 12 years of age, occur in more than one setting (like home and work), be significant enough to cause difficulties for the person, and not be able to be better explained by another illness. There are three types of ADHD: predominately inattentive presentation, predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation, and the combined (inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive) presentation.</p>.<p>Many health care professionals, like psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health physician's assistants and nurse practitioners, may help diagnose ADHD. A professional will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical interview and physical exam as part of the evaluation. Since ADHD can be associated with other mental health conditions, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>, and other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> disorders, as well as with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">autism</a>-spectrum disorders, the evaluator will likely screen for signs of those and other forms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_illness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mental illness</a>. The signs and symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_adults_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">adult ADHD</a> may also be caused by many medical conditions or can be a side effect of a number of medications. Therefore, blood tests are frequently done as part of the initial assessment. Occasionally, an imaging study like an X-ray or CAT scan may be necessary. As part of the evaluation, the individual may be asked questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to assist in determining the diagnosis. Some ADHD symptom checklists for children have been adapted to screen for the condition in adults. Examples of such diagnostic tools include the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) and the Adult Self Report Scale.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_adult_adhd_what_are_adult_adhd_medications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatments for ADHD in adults that do not involve medication include education about the illness, participation in an ADHD support group, and instructional training for a number of issues, including career counseling, organizational skills building, parent counseling, financial training, and development of time-management skills. Many people with this condition may benefit from cognitive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias_picture_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">behavior therapy</a>, a form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psychotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">psychotherapy</a> that seeks to help the individual alter patterns of thinking that may interfere with their functioning.</p>.<p>As with the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ADHD in children</a>, adults often benefit from being treated with a stimulant medication. Commonly, the first prescribed stimulant for the treatment of this condition in children is a derivative of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">methylphenidate</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Ritalin</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dextroamphetamine-oral_capsule_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dextroamphetamine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dextroamphetamine-oral_capsule_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Dexedrine</a>). Given the longer days and increased responsibilities that adolescents and adults have compared to young children, longer-acting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a> are usually prescribed. Examples of those medications include long-acting methylphenidate, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate_patch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Daytrana</a> patches, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Concerta</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate_hydrochloride/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Quillivant XR</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dexmethylphenidate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dexmethylphenidate</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dexmethylphenidate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Focalin</a>-XR), as well as the long-acting amphetamine salt <span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_35"><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/narcolepsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">narcolepsy</a></span></p>.<p>Adults whose symptoms early in the morning or late in the evening are an issue, or whom have a history or propensity to a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drug use</a> disorder, stimulants may not be the optimal medication treatment and, therefore, they may respond better to a nonstimulant medication for treatment of ADHD. Side effects like low appetite, trouble sleeping, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tremors</a>, emotional inhibition, irritability or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">depression</a>, less frequently tics, and rarely <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">hallucinations</a> may make taking a stimulant medication unwise. Using a stimulant to treat ADHD in people who have no history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drug abuse</a> tends to decrease the likelihood of their ever developing a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">substance abuse</a> problem. However, people with a recent history of alcohol or other drug abuse may want to avoid the small but possible <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">addiction</a> potential of stimulant medication. The long-term impact of addiction to a stimulant may be serious, potentially resulting in having a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a>. Individuals who either had less-than-optimal effects or had significant side effects to taking stimulants may respond better to a nonstimulant medication like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guanfacine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">guanfacine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guanfacine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tenex</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guanfacine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Intuniv</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">clonidine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Catapres</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine_kapvay_extended-release/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Kapvay</a>), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atomoxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">atomoxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atomoxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Strattera</a>), or to taking the prescription supplement phosphatidylserine-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">omega-3</a><span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_53"><span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_50"> (Vayarin), which has a specialized delivery system compared to over-the-counter preparations of the omega-3 supplement.</span></span></p>.<p>People with ADHD are more likely to develop mood problems as adults.

The presence of other mental health disorders (co-morbidity) is more likely in adults who are hyperactive and/or impulsive as opposed to being distractible as part of ADHD. Adults with this condition are also more at risk for underachievement in school or at work, being in more car accidents, using tobacco products or other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, having problems managing their anger, and are more likely to develop antisocial behaviors, particularly if not treated. Given the cost effectiveness of treating ADHD and the potentially dire consequences of this illness going undiagnosed and untreated, the importance of identifying ADHD is clear.</p>.<p>ADHD adults tend to have more marital problems, as well as troubles getting along with peers and authority figures. They may, therefore, become isolated socially.</p>.<p>Adults with ADHD are at risk for completing fewer years of education compared to their non-ADHD counterparts. They are often more interested in careers for which forgetfulness is less of an obstacle for good performance, as well as those that provide immediate gratification and other forms of excitement, like sales. They are often at risk for procrastinating on tasks, frequently changing jobs, and losing more jobs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_adult_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for ADHD adults seems to be influenced by the severity of symptoms, scores on intelligence tests, whether the person with the condition has other mental health problems, as well as if there are family issues, such as parental mental health problems, family problems, socioeconomic challenges, and if the individual with ADHD receives treatment. Studies show that stimulant treatment of this condition often improves the prognosis for adults, decreasing the risk for developing other psychiatric problems, failing in school and in the world of work.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_adult_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Research indicates that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breastfeeding</a> up to 6 months of age may help prevent the development of ADHD. Since environmental and social problems like drug use in the mother, medical, and emotional challenges increase the likelihood of developing this condition, prevention or treatment of those issues can help prevent ADHD. In addition, early treatment of children with ADHD can decrease the impact the illness has on the individual's life into adulthood.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_support_groups_available_for_those_living_with_adult_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>CHADD (Children and Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)<br><a href="http://www.chadd-mc.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.chadd-mc.org</a></p>.<p>Daily Strength<br><a href="http://www.dailystrength.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.dailystrength.org</a></p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_people_find_additional_information_on_%0Aadult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>American Counseling Association<br><a href="http://www.counseling.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.counseling.org</a></p>.<p>American Psychiatric Association<br><a href="http://www.psych.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.psych.org</a></p>.<p>American Psychological Association<br><a href="http://helping.apa.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://helping.apa.org</a></p>.<p>National Association of Social Workers<br><a href="http://www.naswdc.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.naswdc.org</a></p>.<p>National Mental Health Association<br><a href="http://www.nmha.org" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.nmha.org</a><span id="cntid"></span></p>
