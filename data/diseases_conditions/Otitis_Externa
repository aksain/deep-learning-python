Usually, bacterial ear infections in children and adults are transmitted through excessive water exposure from swimming, diving, surfing, kayaking, or other water sports. When water collects in the ear canal (frequently trapped by wax), the skin can become soggy, which is an incubator for bacteria to collect and grow. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cuts</a> or abrasions in the lining of the ear canal (for example, from cotton swab injuries) also can expose the ear canal to a bacterial infection.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Itchy</a> ears can drive a person crazy. It can be the first sign of an infection, but if the problem is chronic, it is more likely caused by a chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dermatitis</a> of the ear canal. Seborrheic dermatitis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a> can both affect the ear canal. There is really no cure for this problem, but it can be made tolerable with the use of steroid drops and creams. People with these problems are more prone to acute infections as well. Use of ear plugs, alcohol drops, and non-instrumentation of the ear is the best prevention for infection. Other treatments for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a> may also help itchy ears.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_signs_and_causes_of_chronic_swimmers_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chronic (long-term) swimmer's ear is otitis externa that persists for longer than four weeks or that occurs more than four times a year. This condition can be caused by a</p>.<p>In some people, more than one factor may be involved. For example, a person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">eczema</a> may subsequently develop black ear drainage. This would suggest of an accompanying fungal infection.</p>.<p>The standard treatments and preventative measures, as noted in the next sections, are often all that is needed to treat even a case of chronic otitis externa. However, in people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> or those with suppressed immune systems, chronic swimmer's ear can become a serious disease (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a> external otitis). Malignant external otitis is a misnomer because it is not a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, but rather an aggressive bacterial (typically <i>Pseudomonas</i>) infection of the base of the skull.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_objects_bugs_or_insects_in_the_ear_cause_outer_ear_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Young children often will put foreign objects their ear by accident or while scratching or trying to clean their ear. Often, children who put objects in their ear also have swimmerâ€™s ear (external ear infection). Do not try to remove objects stuck in the ear because it can be difficult. Call your pediatrician to have the object safely removed. Usually this can be done in the office, but sometimes, general anesthesia may be necessary to remove the lodged object if it is stuck deeply in the ear or if the child or adult is uncooperative.</p>.<p>Insects or bugs can be trapped in the ear, for example, small gnats can be caught and stuck in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_wax/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">earwax</a>. Often, bugs and insects can washed out with warm water. Larger insects or bugs may not be able to turn around in the narrow canal. If the insect or bug is still alive, first kill it by filling the ear with mineral oil. This will suffocate the insect, and then see your doctor to have it removed.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_home_remedies_eardrops_or_antibiotics_treat_and_cure_swimmers_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Swimmer's ear is a treatable condition that usually goes away quickly with appropriate treatment.
