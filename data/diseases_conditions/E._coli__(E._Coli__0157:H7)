These bacteria commonly live in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> of people and in warm blood animals worldwide and do not cause problems. Some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strains</a> (serotypes) cause diseases that range from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infections</a> to life-threatening, bloody <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a>. It is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium.</p>.<p><i>E coli</i> O157:H7 is the predominant serotype of <i>E. coli</i> that form one group of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enterovirulent_e_coli_eec/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">EEC</a>. This EEC group is termed enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> or EHEC. Unfortunately, other terms in the medical literature describe this group (VTEC or Vero toxin-producing <i>E. coli</i> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli_0157h7_escherichia_coli_0157h7/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">STEC</a> or Shiga toxin-producing <i>E. coli</i>). Research suggests that only a small number of <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 are needed to cause infection (ingestion of about 10â€“100 organisms) instead of the thousands to millions needed for infections by other <i>E. coli</i> serotypes. Infection is aided by adhesive receptors (pili or fimbriae) that attach the bacteria to human intestinal cells. Most of the problems caused by the bacteria are due to two Shiga toxins, termed Stx 1 and Stx 2 termed Vero toxins. (Toxins are chemicals that are produced by the bacterium and damage human cells.) These toxins, for example, (for example, &lt;/i&gt;E. coli Shiga&lt;/i&gt; toxin), are almost identical to toxins produced by another related bacterium, <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shigella_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Shigella</a></i> <i>spp.</i> that causes dysentery (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shigella_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Shigellosis</a>), and can damage and kill intestinal cells. Shigellosis occasionally causes anemia, damage to platelets, and death of cells in other organs, especially the kidneys.</p>.<p><i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 is a major health problem. It is estimated to cause infection in more than 70,000 individuals a year in the United States, and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 is responsible for the majority of <i>E. coli</i> outbreaks in the U.S. It has been reported to cause both large as well as small outbreaks.</p>.<p><i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 diarrheal illness was first recognized when CDC personnel isolated <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 from patients in two separate outbreaks in Oregon and Michigan. The illnesses were associated with eating hamburgers at the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eating_out_and_entertaining/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">restaurants</a> of a national chain; some patients experienced hemorrhagic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">colitis</a> (inflammation and bleeding of the colon). Thus, hemorrhagic colitis due to <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 is commonly referred to as <b>hamburger disease</b>. Since that time, <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 also has been associated with contaminated water, foods, and unpasteurized or incorrectly pasteurized (heat-treated) dairy products.</p>.<p>In 2015 an outbreak of <em>E. coli 0157:H7</em> infection occurred in Montana from Costco contaminated rotisserie chicken salad, and resulted in recalls of products from Taylor farms containing celery. In 2017, an outbreak of this strain was linked to Healthy Brand <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/soy_glycine_soya-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Soy</a> nut Butter. The CDC found 32 people from 12 states infected with the bacteria, 12 of which required hospitalization, and nine developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Twenty-six of the 32 patients infected were younger than 18. The product was recalled, and fortunately, there were no deaths.</p>.<p>A widespread outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 began in April 2018. The source was traced by the CDC to Romaine lettuce and other lettuce produce and distributed from Yuma, Arizona. The bacterial strain is aggressive. Of the 121 identified patients, 1 death and 52 hospitalizations along with 14 people who developed HUS have occurred. The 121 patients have been found in 25 states with the most diagnosed in California and Pennsylvania. The CDC strongly recommends that if you cannot identify where your Romaine lettuce originated, you should not eat it. Restaurants and retailers are advised not to serve or sell romaine lettuce from the Yuma Arizona growing region.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="8_early_signs_and_symptoms__of_e_coli_0157h7_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The early or initial symptoms of <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 infections usually appear about three to five (though occasionally in as few as one day or as many as 10 days) after a person ingests the bacteria; the symptoms include:</p>.<p>These symptoms can be seen in infected children and adults.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="17_later_symptoms_of_signs_and_symptoms_of_e_coli_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of people (especially normal adults) that are infected resolve the infection without antibiotics (self-limiting) in about five to seven days. However, some people (about 10% of people infected and especially children under the age of 5 and the elderly) develop more severe signs and symptoms, and these people usually require hospitalization and aggressive treatment. These patients develop the usual early symptoms listed above, but do not resolve the infection. They develop symptoms that last longer (at least a week) and, if not treated promptly, the infection may lead to disability or death.</p>.<p>Later or late symptoms of <em>E. coli</em> infections may include:</p>.<p>These symptoms or complications fall into three main categories:</p>.<p>For most people (about 90%), the infection clears and a good outcome or and prognosis is good. However, if any of the previously mentioned complications occur, the prognosis may range from good to poor. The variable prognosis depends on the severity of the complication, the rapidity of diagnosis and treatment, the response of the individual to adequate treatment and the overall health of the individual. Children and the elderly are at higher risk for adverse outcomes.</p>.<p>Strains of <em>E. coli 0157:H7</em> mainly are known to produce gastrointestinal symptoms, Only a few reports of such strains causing <em>E. coli</em> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">urinary tract infections</a>.</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you__get_an_e_coli_0157h7_infection_how_is_it_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most commonly, <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 comes from eating raw or undercooked ground beef (for example, hamburger) or from drinking raw milk. The bacteria are found in animal feces, particularly cattle feces, and contact with the feces can lead to contamination of many types of food and fluids. In 2010, the FDA recalled several productions of beef, including beef placed in pet food. Less commonly, <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 can be transmitted from one person to another, usually by direct physical contact. However, a major outbreak in 2018 came from contaminated Romaine lettuce grown in Yuma, Arizona.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_can_e_coli_bacteria_live_outside_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Studies suggest that <em>E. coli</em> survival outside of the body of humans and animals depends on environmental variables such as moisture, nutrients like iron and temperature. Some studies suggest <em>E. coli</em> survival times may vary from about 12 hours to 2 months or more.</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="is_e_coli_0157h7_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>E. coli</i> 0857:H7 is an infection, and is contagious. It can be spread from person to person by contamination with feces of food or water then is eaten.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_e_coli_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are over 700 strains (serotypes) of <i>E. coli</i>. Most of the strains of <i>E. coli</i> are normal inhabitants of the small intestine and colon and do not cause disease in the intestines. (They are non-pathogenic.) Nevertheless, non-pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> can cause disease if they spread outside of the intestines, for example, into the urinary tract (where they cause bladder or kidney infections), or into the blood stream (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sepsis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sepsis</a> or <em>E. coli</em> in the blood). Other <i>E. coli</i> strains (enterovirulent <i>E. coli</i> strains or EEC) cause "poisoning" or diarrhea even though they usually remain within the intestine by producing toxins or intestinal inflammation. Four to six groups <em>E. coli</em> serotypes comprise EEC.. (Some researchers combine groups.) Their names are derived from descriptions of the characteristics that separate them from the other groups.</p>.<p><i>E. coli</i> were first isolated by T. Escherich in 1885 and were named after him. The over 700 serotypes are identified by small antigenic changes in their surface "O" antigens (lipopolysaccharides or molecules on the bacterial surface of gram-negative bacteria), for example <i>E. coli</i> 0157 or <i>E. coli</i> 055. These serotypes are identified by immunological tests using antibodies to the antigens. "H" protein antigens (different types of flagella that make the bacteria motile) further distinguish <em>E. coli</em> strains. Consequently, a particular <i>E. coli</i> strain can be identified as H, followed by a number, and this identifier is added to the "0" name; for example, <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7. Although this name designation seems complicated, researchers and clinicians use these antigenic identifiers to track specific <i>E. coli</i> strains that cause outbreaks of disease.</p>.<p>As discussed previously, <i>E. coli</i> strain, <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 is notorious for its potential to cause complicated disease in humans; the remainder of this article will focus on this <i>E. coli</i> strain. However, it is important to remember other types of <i>E. coli</i> produce similar if not identical problems and they too, will be addressed in this article; the newest serotype causing problems is <i>E. coli</i> 0145.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_test_for_e_coli" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 infection begins with an accurate history, physical exam, and an analysis of a sample of stool from the patient. A presumptive diagnosis is frequently made if the patient has symptoms of bloody diarrhea and a history of being exposed to persons, foods, or liquids known to be a source of an <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 outbreak.</p>.<p>Because other disease-causing bacteria (for example, <i> Shigella</i> and <i> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/salmonella_food_poisoning_salmonellosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Salmonella</a></i>) can give patients similar initial symptoms and test negative on bacterial screeing tests like the oxidase test; a definite diagnosis is based on culture of <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 from the patient's sample of stool on special culturing plates that then are tested with antiserum (antibodies) that react only with <i>E. coli</i> O157H7. Not all clinics or hospitals have the diagnostic antiserum, so the testing may take a few days.</p>.<p>In addition to taking a stool sample test, in 2009 the CDC recommended that all patients being screened for community-acquired diarrheal infections have their stool samples analyzed with antisera for Shiga toxins, toxins produced by <em>E. coli 0157:H7</em>, and a few other bacteria, for example, <em><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enterovirulent_e_coli_eec/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli 0104:H4</a></em>.</p>.<p>This approach may result in faster diagnosis of I infections. Urine samples can be tested, but <em>E. coli 0157:H7</em> infrequently causes urinar tract infections (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">UTIs</a>) Its renal involvement is mainly due to toxins produced by the bacteria. This approach may result in faster diagnosis of <em>E. coli 0157:H7 </em>infections. Urine samples can be tested, but <em>E. coli 0157:H7</em> infrequently causes UTIs.</p>.<p>Blood tests such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">complete blood count</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>), and blood levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolytes</a>, platelets, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/creatinine_blood_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">creatinine</a> (blood tests that measure function of the kidney) are performed periodically to look for the development of HUS or TTP.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_e_coli_0157h7" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for <em>E. coli</em> 0157:H7 depends on the severity of the disease.</p>.<p>Patients, especially healthy adults, often require no treatment for <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 since many infections are self-limited. Moreover, for the acute diarrheal illness, antibiotics have not proven useful. In fact, some studies have shown that antibiotics may increase the chances of developing HUS (up to 17-fold). This effect is thought to occur because the antibiotic damages the bacteria, causing them to release even more toxin. Most investigators suggest antibiotic use only if a patient is septic, that is, there is evidence that the bacterium has spread to parts of the body other than the intestine. In addition, use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atropine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">atropine</a> and diphenoxylate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenoxylate_and_atropine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lomotil</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> that are commonly used to control diarrhea, also may increase symptoms and trigger complications.</p>.<p>In summary, mild infections are treated with the following:</p>.<p>Treatment for severe symptoms of infection and its complications may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_infection_with_e_coli_0157h7" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although these conditions have been presented in the symptoms section, they are presented here again because they are actual complications that can occur after the initial disease begins. Patients without these complications usually have excellent outcomes (a good prognosis). Individuals who develop the following complications have outcomes that range from good to poor, depending on their overall health and how quickly they are diagnosed, treated, and respond to treatment. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Meningitis</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> are potential complications that may occur when individuals with a weakened immune system (when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a>, in infants or elderly) become infected.</p>.<p>The incubation period between exposure to EHEC bacteria, including <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7, and the onset of symptoms is usually three to four days but may be longer in some individuals. Symptoms of EHEC infection include severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">abdominal pain</a> and abdominal tenderness, which often is associated with bloody diarrhea. Curiously, there often is little or no fever. The diarrhea typically lasts for six to eight days. Dehydration and blood loss can lead to death in some patients if not corrected early.</p>.<p>Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most worrisome complication of EHEC infection, especially in children, because it is a serious and potentially fatal complication. "Hemolytic" refers to the breakup of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red blood cells</a>, which leads to anemia. There also is destruction of platelets, which leads to low blood levels of platelets (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thrombocytopenia</a>), which in turn promotes abnormal bleeding. "Uremic" refers to failure of the kidneys. In addition, problems in the brain with seizures and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coma</a> may occur.</p>.<p>Hemolytic-uremic syndrome most commonly affects children under the ages of 10 years and is the most common cause of acute kidney failure in infants and young children. It occurs in about 6% to 10% of hemorrhagic colitis caused by E coli 0157:H7 and usually occurs approximately 7 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea. Early intervention usually results in better outcomes.</p>.<p>Persons infected with <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7, particularly the elderly, can develop a syndrome similar to HUS called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or TTP with clotting of blood within small blood vessels; anemia due to fragmentation of red blood cells; and a shortage of platelets (thrombocytopenia) that results in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/easy_bruising/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">easy bruising</a>, neurologic abnormalities, impaired kidney function, and fever. TTP is a serious consequence of <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 infection that requires early and aggressive treatment since it results in death in about 10% of all patients who develop it.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_e_coli_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The CDC recommends the following to prevent infections from <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7.</p>.<p>Moreover, many researchers suggest that hamburgers ordered in a restaurant should be cooked through and completely so that no pink hamburger meat is visible inside. This cooking reduces the chance that <i>E. coli</i> serotypes will remain alive in the meat.</p>.<p>All other foods involved in a recall should be put in the trash. No one should attempt to cook the recalled material and eat it, including hamburger meat.</p>.<p>Because <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 is routinely found in the intestines of cattle, companies have developed a vaccine to reduce the number of these bacteria in cattle. The first vaccine for cattle was FDA approved in 2009. There is no vaccine available for <i>E. coli</i> 0157:H7 in humans.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kind_of_doctors_treat_e_coli_0157h7_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who develop only acute symptoms that are mild usually do not require a physician because the illness resolves spontaneously. However, for some children, a pediatrician may be notified and/or may want to see the child. If a person develops severe symptoms, a team of doctors that may include a nephrologist (kidney specialist), a critical care specialist (pediatric or adult), a hematologist, a pulmonologist, cardiologist, and an infectious disease specialist or even a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney transplant</a> surgeon may be needed. Hospitalization also may be necessary.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="other_enterohemorrhagic_e_coli_strains_for_example_0145_026h11_0104h4_and_0121" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC or STEC) infections were thought to be variants of strain 0157:H7, but this has been shown not to be the situation. Apparently, many other serotypes such as 0145 can acquire the plasmid that is responsible for the synthesis of Shiga (Vero) toxin, and thus can produce disease almost identical to disease symptoms produced by 0157:H7 in infected humans. Just like the 0157:H7 strains, these other <i>E. coli</i> serotypes can cause outbreaks of bloody diarrhea with hemorrhagic colitis that can become complicated by hemolytic uremia.</p>.<p>In 2011, an outbreak in Germany began due to <i>E. coli</i> 0104:H4 due to contamination of sprouts. The outbreak was extensive as over 4000 people in 16 countries became infected. There is some consideration that this strain (and others) may be grouped together as a new EEC group in the future.</p>.<p>Although EHEC strains can be transmitted person to person and on or in contaminated food, the source for the 0145 strain outbreak that has occurred in several states (California, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee) was never identified by the CDC.</p>.<p>Another strain, <i>E. coli</i> 0121, caused an outbreak in 19 states in the U.S.; it was traced to contaminated Farm Rich brand of frozen foods.</p>.<p>These serotypes produce essentially the same type of disease as 0157:H7 and are diagnosed and treated in the same manner. Consequently, the previous sections use 0157:H7 as the prototypic EHEC so for all practical purposes, it represents all the EHEC serotypes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
