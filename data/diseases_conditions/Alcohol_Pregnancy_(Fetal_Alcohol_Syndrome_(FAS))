These include (1) documentation of three characteristic facial abnormalities, (2) documentation of smaller than expected <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prenatal</a> and/or postnatal length, weight, and head circumference growth parameters, and (3) documentation of central nervous system abnormalities. These criteria will be further described later in this article.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alcohol is rapidly transported via placental blood flow from mother to fetus and is known to cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">miscarriage</a> and birth defects. Within two hours of maternal ingestion, fetal alcohol blood levels are similar to maternal alcohol blood levels. There is no established relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and side effects sustained by the infant. This puzzling observation may reflect the maternal rate of alcohol breakdown via her <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a>.</p>.<p>It has been observed that alcohol consumed at any time during pregnancy may be associated with severe and permanent consequences. First trimester pregnancy alcohol ingestion is linked to the characteristic facial abnormalities of FAS as well as a reduction of intrauterine growth rate. Alcohol consumption during the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/second_trimester_16_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">second trimester</a> also contributes to lower IQ, growth retardation in length and birth weight, as well as cognitive deficits of reading, spelling, and math. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/third_trimester_32_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Third trimester</a> alcohol consumption amplifies retardation in birth length and ultimate adult height potential.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The Surgeon General and the Secretary for Health and Human Services recommend total abstinence from alcohol for women planning pregnancy, at the time of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/conception_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">conception</a> and throughout the entire pregnancy. No safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been documented. Multiple other countries have established similar guidelines.</p>.<p>Other risk factors include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Infants with the diagnostic criteria to establish fetal alcohol syndrome exhibit the following characteristic findings:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The risk for potential fetal alcohol syndrome is established during the first prenatal visit. Pregnant women are questioned regarding behavioral risk factors, including illicit drug usage, alcohol consumption, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, and other high-risk behaviors. Several screening questionnaires may be utilized; these include (1) T-ACE, (2) TWEAK, and (3) AUDIT-C. There are several laboratory blood studies that may indicate recent use or repeated and excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alcohol abuse</a>.</p>.<p>Prenatal indicators for potential alcohol use would note smaller than expected growth in length, weight, and head measurements. Slower than expected head growth is a reflection of subnormal brain growth. Once born, the above-noted facial changes will lead the pediatrician to consideration of the diagnosis of FAS. The myriad of developmental and cognitive delays discussed above will also stimulate consideration of FAS in children who are failing in cognitive advancement or with associated behavioral deficiencies.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While no cure exists for fetal alcohol syndrome, early intervention programs have been shown to lessen the impact of language, motor, and cognitive impairments. Such aggressive programs utilize physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and educational therapy to maximize benefit. Adolescents and adults may benefit from programs dealing with academic, legal, and psychiatric problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_and_long-term_effects_of_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many of the issues faced by infants and children with FAS continue into adolescence and adulthood. These may include:</p>.<p>More unique to adolescents and adults are issues with sexual behavior, legal problems, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">substance abuse</a>. It is often observed that the characteristic facial features noted in infancy and childhood seem to "soften" with age. A small-sized head and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/achondroplasia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">short stature</a> do continue into adulthood.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As noted in the above discussion, an individual with FAS may experience a lifelong litany of both physical and intellectual challenges. Early intervention programs and multi-therapy programs (including physical therapy) may often lessen the impact of the diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_fetal_alcohol_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes!
