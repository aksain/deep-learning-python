<p><b><a name="why_do_we_need_vaccines" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>None of us wants to see our children get sick. If we could, we would protect them from any illness, no matter how <nobr>small, even</nobr> the sniffles.</p>.<p>Now suppose you could make your child safe from some of the most deadly diseases in history. Suppose that at the same time you could also help protect your neighbors' children and other children around the country from the same diseases. Finally, you could actually help to rid the world of some of these diseases that have been crippling and killing children for centuries.</p>.<p>You can do all of these things with one of the easiest and yet most powerful health tools ever developed. You can make sure you immunize your children.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_vaccines_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When you receive a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a>, it helps your body to create antibodies. Antibodies are the body's defenses that fight off any foreign substances (germs). Although your body can create antibodies on its own, many of the vaccine-preventable diseases cause severe illness and even death before your body can produce enough antibodies.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Vaccines</a> work best when given at certain ages. For example, health care professionals do not usually administer the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">measles</a> vaccine until a child is at least 1 year old. If a child receives the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/measles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">measles</a> vaccine earlier than that, it may not work as well. On the other hand, the DTaP vaccine should be given over a period of time in a series of properly spaced doses. More information about the specific diseases your child is vaccinated against is listed later in this article.</p>.<p>Following is a description of the routine childhood immunization schedule. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the schedule each year.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_recommended_childhood_vaccines_and_at_what_ages_they_should_be_given" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If first dose given before 15 years:</p>.<p>If first does given after 15 years:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_you_do_if_your_child_misses_a_shot" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For most <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a>, it is never too late to catch up on missed shots. Children who missed their first shots at 2 months of age can start later. Children who have received some of their shots and then fallen behind schedule can catch up without having to start over. If you have children who were not immunized when they were infants, or who have gotten behind schedule, contact your doctor or the health department clinic. They will help you get your children up to date on their immunizations.</p>.<p>(NOTE: Don't postpone your child's immunizations just because you know he or she can catch up later. Every month a child goes without scheduled immunizations is a month that the child is unprotected from vaccine-preventable diseases.)</p>.<p>A combination vaccine is more than one vaccine contained in a single shot. Doctors and parents both like them because they allow a child to get several vaccines at once without having to get as many injections. Several combination vaccines are already in use (for example, MMR, MMRV, DTaP, Hib/HepB, DTaP/IPV/HepB, DtaP/IPV/Hib, and DtaP/IPV). More are under development.</p>.<p>Rarely, a child should wait before getting certain vaccines or should not get them at all. Tell your doctor or nurse if any of these apply to your child on a day when an immunization visit is scheduled.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_vaccine-preventable_diseases" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The D in DTaP stands for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diphtheria</a>.</p>.<p>The T in DTaP stands for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tetanus</a>.</p>.<p>The P in DTaP stands for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pertussis</a>.</p>.<p>The first M in MMR stands for measles.</p>.<p>The second M in MMR stands for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mumps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mumps</a>.</p>.<p>The R in MMR stands for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rubella</a>.</p>.<p>For more information about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccinations</a>, please visit the MedicineNet Immunizations (Vaccinations) Center and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines</a>.</p>.<p>The Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov) kindly provided portions of the above information.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
