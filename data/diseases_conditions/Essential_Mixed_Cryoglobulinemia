<p><b><a name="what_is_cryoglobulinemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cryoglobulinemia is a medical condition that is caused by proteins called cryoglobulins, which are present in the blood. Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins that by definition have the unusual property of precipitating from the serum when it is chilled in the laboratory and then dissolves back into the serum upon rewarming.</p>.<p>Cryoglobulins may or may not cause disease. Cryoglobulins can accompany another condition (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polymyositis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dermatomyositis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_myeloma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple myeloma</a>, viral infections, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymphoma</a>) or be an isolated condition themselves, called cryoglobulinemia.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_are_associated_with_cryoglobulinemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cryoglobulins in the blood (cryoglobulinemia) can cause a variety of problems throughout the body. These include complications resulting from abnormal "thickness" of the blood (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> in the eyes leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a>) and inflammation of blood vessels, referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vasculitis</a>. Vasculitis of arteries can result in blockage of blood flow, leading to damage to the organ(s) supplied by the affected blood vessels, such as in the skin, kidneys, or elsewhere.
