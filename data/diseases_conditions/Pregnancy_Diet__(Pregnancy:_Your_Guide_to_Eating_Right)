Research from famines during 
World War II in Europe have taught us about the epigenetic implications of restriction during pregnancy. <b>Epigenetics</b> describes the impact of the prenatal environment on the genetic programming of the child that stays with them for life. In fact, the prenatal environment has an impact on the developing ovaries and eggs in the female fetus, having an impact on the next generation too! A mother's nutritional choices during pregnancy can affect her grandchildren!</p>.<p>
During the famines in World War II, pregnant Dutch women lived on less than 900 calories a day for a winter and their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metabolism_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a> became very efficient at storing energy.

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vegetarian_diet_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">vegan or vegetarian diets</a> during pregnancy. In fact, doing so may help them avoid some of the added hormones that are common in non-organic animal products. However, there are some nutrients that are commonly deficient in vegetarian diets. Pregnant women who are vegan or vegetarian should be extra careful to ensure they are getting enough calcium, iron, and B-12. Protein intake needs to be monitored too. </p>.<p>Vegetarian protein sources include:</p>.<p>These last three are not part of a vegan 
pregnancy diet, but are appropriate for a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet.</p>.<p>B-12 is needed for proper DNA expression in the growing embryo and fetus.

Pregnant women need 30mcg a day 
according to the Recommended Daily Allowance, and the sources are all animal-based. 
Vegan women may want to ensure they get enough by taking a methylcobalamin supplement. Other B vitamins, specifically folate and B6, are important in pregnancy. A good-quality prenatal multi or B complex will provide these nutrients.</p>.<p><b><a name="protein_needs_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Protein requirements in pregnancy are increased by 50%. On average, a pregnant woman needs about 70 grams of protein per day. Protein will not only ensure good growth of the baby, it will help keep the mother's blood sugar stable and may help reduce <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/early_pregnancy_symptoms_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">morning sickness</a>. Research studies have shown better birth outcomes (fewer underweight or early babies) when a mother's daily diet is at least 25% protein. Most people think of meat when they think about protein, but there are many excellent vegetarian sources. A vegan or vegetarian pregnancy diet can easily get enough protein from bean, nut, and grain sources.  Additionally, relying only meat sources can increase your intake of saturated fat and other components of meat that are wise to limit in the diet. Here are some examples of good sources of healthy proteins.</p>.<p><b><a name="iron_needs_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Iron is a common deficiency during pregnancy. Iron is an essential mineral needed to transport oxygen to tissues. It is also necessary for DNA repair and mitochondrial energy production. Insufficient iron can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> and symptoms of:</p>.<p>Anemia has been linked to pre-term births, low birth weight, and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> and increased maternal mortality<sup>10</sup>. Thus, it's really important to get enough iron during pregnancy. The RDA for iron is 27mg during pregnancy; your obstetrician 
or midwife may recommend 40mg per day to correct a deficiency. Cooking in cast-iron skillets can also increase iron intake â€“ you can add 5mg of additional iron for each per saucy, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascorbic_acid-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin C</a>-rich dish you cook in cast iron.</p>.<p>These are some good food sources of iron:</p>.<p><b><a name="folate_needs_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Folate occurs naturally in vegetables and whole grains but it is lost in the processing of refined grains.Â  Folate deficiency increases the risk of congenital anomalies, most notably neural tube defects such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spina_bifida_and_anencephaly/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">spina bifida</a>. For this reason, it's one of the most serious nutritional deficiencies in pregnancy. Unfortunately, the critical time for neural tube development occurs in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she's pregnant and thus when she is less likely to be taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid or getting enough in the diet. Because of this, fortification of grain products (adding back in what was lost in processing) was mandated in 1998, and the prevalence of neural tube defects has dropped dramatically. Unfortunately, these foods are fortified with synthetic folic acid, not folate, and a very common genetic variant of the MTHFR gene (that codes for an enzyme important in processing of amino acids), makes it difficult for people to convert folic acid to useable folate and pregnant women with this variant are at particular risk. Researchers have suggested it would be much better to supplement pregnant women, and enrich food, with the active form methyltetrahydrofolate, rather than folic acid<sup>11</sup>. Fortunately, pregnant women can get the necessary 600mcg of active, natural form folate from these dietary sources:</p>.<p><b><a name="calcium_needs_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Calcium is critical for developing bones. It also reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia and hypertension. Women who get enough calcium during pregnancy have a 35% lower risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a> and a 55% lower risk of preeclampsia. If the mother isn't getting enough additional calcium in the diet, the fetus will still get enough, but it will come from the reserves in 
the mother's bones. The mother's ability to absorb calcium is greatly increased during pregnancy. This is why the RDA for calcium doesn't increase during pregnancy. However, most adult women don't get enough calcium in the first place.</p>.<p>When 
we think about calcium, most people think about milk, but there are numerous non-dairy sources of calcium. Women who are lactose intolerant can choose non-dairy sources. Pregnant women need 1000mg of calcium per day<sup>9</sup>. This can be reached with a few servings per day from the food list below. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">minerals</a> in vegetables sources, like spinach, can be 
made more available by cooking them with an acid such as vinegar or lemon juice. Try sautÃ©ing kale with apple cider vinegar and walnuts.</p>.<p><b><a name="iodine_needs_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Iodine needs increase by almost 50% during pregnancy. Iodine is used for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid hormone</a> function and for the developing nervous system of the fetus. Women who have iodine deficiency, or are hypothyroid for other reasons, are at risk of slowing the brain development of their baby. Pregnant women need 220mcg of iodine and the American Thyroid Association suggests pregnant women supplement with 150mcg of iodine daily<sup>12.</sup> Seaweed and seafood are the major source of iodine, but because of the need to limit mercury exposure in pregnancy, relying on seafood may not be wise.</p>.<p><b><a name="zinc_%0Aneeds_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Research suggests that 82% of pregnant women are deficient in zinc, which makes it one of the most important nutrients to pay attention to during pregnancy<sup>12</sup>. In addition to the negative outcomes of low birth weight, early delivery, and preeclampsia that result from deficiency, zinc is important for the immune system of the mother and baby. Iron competes with zinc for absorption, so women who are supplementing with extra iron also need to make sure they are getting extra zinc. Some food sources are:</p>.<p><b><a name="vitamin_d_needs_and_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnant women need 600 IU of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin D</a> according to the USDA RDA guidelines; however, many experts believe this estimate is far too low. Humans synthesize vitamin D from sun exposure and there are very few food sources. Additionally, factors such as skin pigmentation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obesity</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sunscreen</a> usage impact the ability to make vitamin D from sunlight. In clinical practice, I measure patients' blood levels of vitamin D and find that many are deficient even if they are taking a 2000mcg vitamin D3 supplement every day. Pregnant women who are concerned about vitamin D can consult a midwife, naturopathic midwife, or obstetrician who is willing to test their vitamin D levels so they know how much they need.
