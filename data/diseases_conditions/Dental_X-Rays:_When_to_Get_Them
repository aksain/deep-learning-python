history and current condition. Some people may need X-rays as often as every
six months; others with no recent dental or gum disease and who visit their
dentist regularly may get X-rays only every couple of years. If you are a new
patient, your dentist may take X-rays as part of the initial examination and to
establish a baseline record from which to compare changes that may occur over
time.</p>.<p>Some general guidelines your dentist may follow regarding the frequency of

Fortunately, the dose of radiation you are exposed to during the taking of
dental X-rays is extremely small.</p>.<p>Advances in dentistry over the years have lead to a number of measures that
will minimize the risks associated with X-rays. However, even with the
advancements in safety, the effects of radiation are added together over a
lifetime. So every little bit of radiation you receive from all sources
counts.</p>.<p>If you are concerned about radiation exposure due to X-rays, talk to your
dentist about how often X-rays are needed and why they are being taken. While
some people need X-rays taken more frequently, current guidelines require that
X-rays be given only when needed for clinical diagnosis.</p>.<p class="credits">Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.<br><br>
