<p><b><a name="triglyceride_test_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_triglycerides" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Triglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.</p>.<p>The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a> to form chylomicrons. This is the source of energy for cells in the body. Fat cells and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> cells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.</p>.<p>Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peripheral_vascular_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">peripheral artery disease</a>. Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">liver disease</a> and pancreatitis.</p>.<p>Certain diseases and conditions may cause elevated triglyceride blood levels, for example:</p>.<p>Alcohol consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HDL</a> (the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>. <b>However, it is not recommended that people start to drink alcohol to obtain these effects.</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_triglyceride_levels_measured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Triglyceride levels in the blood are measured by a simple blood test. Often, triglycerides are measured as part of a lipoprotein panel (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipid</a> panel) in which triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) are measured at the same time.</p>.<p>Fasting for 8-12 hours before the test is required. Fat levels in the blood are affected by recent eating and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a>. Falsely elevated results may occur if the blood test is done just after eating.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_normal_triglyceride_levels_what_do_elevated_triglyceride_levels_mean" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cholesterol levels</a> are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_lower_my_triglyceride_levels" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Returning triglyceride levels to normal may decrease the risk of heart attack, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stroke</a>, and peripheral artery disease. Controlling high triglycerides and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_frequently_asked_questions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high cholesterol</a> is a lifelong challenge. A healthy lifestyle includes eating well, exercising routinely, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking cessation</a>, and weight loss. This may be all that is needed, but some people additionally require medications to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Your health-care professional will help make decisions with you to decide what treatment combination is most appropriate.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="changes_in_diet_to_lower_triglycerides" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following dietary changes may be helpful in lowering triglycerides.</p>.<p>Switch to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of trans or saturated fats. The best sources of these fats are olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, lake trout, sardines, herring, and albacore tuna. Learning to interpret food labels will help you understand the kinds of fat in the food you buy and consume.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
