While most of our DNA is in the chromosomes in the cell nucleus, some of our DNA is in another important structure called the mitochondrion (plural: mitochondria).   </p>.<p>The mitochondria are located outside the nucleus in the cell's cytoplasm. Each mitochondrion has a chromosome made of DNA that is quite different from the better known chromosomes in the nucleus. The mitochondrial chromosome is much smaller; it is round (whereas the chromosomes in the nucleus are normally shaped like rods); there are many copies of the mitochondrial chromosome in every cell; and no matter whether we are male or female, we inherit all of our mitochondrial chromosome from our mother.</p>.<p>Much of the DNA in our mitochondria is used to manufacture proteins involved in the key function of mitochondria -- to produce energy and power the cells in our body.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_melas" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As a result of the disturbed function of their cells' mitochondria, patients with MELAS develop</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_melas_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of MELAS is usually suspected on clinical grounds. However, confirmation of the diagnosis usually requires a muscle or brain biopsy. The muscle biopsy shows characteristic ragged red fibers; a brain biopsy shows stroke-like changes.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_do_people_with_melas_develop_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>MELAS can affect people at very different times in life, ranging from age 4 to age 40 or more. However, most patients with MELAS syndrome show symptoms before they are 20 years old.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_melas_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no known treatment for the underlying disease, which is progressive and fatal. Patients are managed according to what areas of the body are affected at a particular time. antioxidants and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a> have been used, but there have been no consistent successes reported.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_other_mitochondrial_diseases" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, mutations (genetic changes) in the mitochondrial chromosome are responsible for a number of other disorders aside from MELAS such as:</p>.<p>MELAS and all other mitochondrial diseases were not well understood before it was discovered that they were due to mutations in the chromosomes of the mitochondria.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
