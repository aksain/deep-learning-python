<p><b><a name="achondroplasia_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_achondroplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Achondroplasia is a genetic (inherited) condition that results in abnormally short stature and is the most common cause of short stature with disproportionately short limbs. The average height of an adult with achondroplasia is 131 cm (52 inches, or 4 foot 4 inches) in males and 124 cm (49 inches, or 4 foot 1 inch) in females.</p>.<p>Although achondroplasia literally means "without cartilage formation," the defect in achondroplasia is not in forming cartilage but in converting it to bone, particularly in the long bones.</p>.<p>Achondroplasia is one of the oldest known <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth defects</a>. The frequency of achondroplasia is estimated to range from about 1 in 10,000 births in Latin America to about 12 in 77,000 in Denmark. An average figure worldwide is approximately 1 in 25,000 births.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_characteristics_of_achondroplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Achondroplasia is a distinctive condition that usually can be noted at birth.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_achondroplasia_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of achondroplasia can be based on the typical physical features, the hallmarks of achondroplasia, evident at birth. Characteristic features are also seen by 
X-rays, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a>, and other imaging techniques. With ultrasound imaging, the diagnosis can sometimes be strongly suspected before birth.</p>.<p>The molecular diagnosis of achondroplasia before birth is possible if there is suspicion of the diagnosis or an increased risk (such as when a parent is affected by achondroplasia). In families in which both parents have achondroplasia, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amniocentesis/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prenatal diagnosis</a> may be particularly useful, the aim being to distinguish fatal homozygous achondroplasia (with two copies of the defective gene) from heterozygous achondroplasia (with one copy of the achondroplasia gene) from normal. Diagnosis before birth is accomplished by examining cells obtained by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chorionic_villus_sampling/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chorionic villus sampling</a> (CVS) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amniocentesis/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amniocentesis</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_for_patients_with_achondroplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children and adults with achondroplasia can lead normal lives provided they receive attentive, informed care by their physicians and parents. Considerations in monitoring children with achondroplasia include careful measurements of growth (length/height and weight) and head circumference using curves specially standardized for those with achondroplasia. Knowledgeable pediatric care and periodic orthopedic and neurologic examinations are critical.</p>.<p>When special problems complicate achondroplasia, prompt and expert intervention is important. For example:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_achondroplasia_inherited" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Achondroplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait whereby only a single copy of the abnormal gene 
(mutation) is required to cause achondroplasia. The gene for achondroplasia is fully penetrant, meaning that everyone who possesses it has achondroplasia. No one with the gene escapes achondroplasia. However, there is some variation in expression of the gene, meaning that children with achondroplasia are not carbon copies of each other, although they may look alike to the untutored eye. </p>.<p>In only about an eighth of cases is the gene inherited from a parent who has achondroplasia. Rather, about seven-eighths of cases are due to a new mutation (a new change in the gene). This means that most cases of achondroplasia occur sporadically (out of the blue) and are the result of a new mutation in a sperm or ovum of one of the normal- appearing parents. The chance of a new mutation rises with the age of the father. As early as 1912 it was noted that sporadic (new) cases were more often last-born than first-born children. This fits with the fact that the chance of an achondroplastic birth has been shown to increase with paternal age (age of the father).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_someone_with_achondroplasia_has_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although most children with achondroplasia do not have an achondroplastic parent but have a new mutant gene for achondroplasia, they can still transmit the gene to their children, and the risk for passing that gene down to a child is 50% in each <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_two_people_with_achondroplasia_have_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with achondroplasia sometimes have children together. If so, each parent has a 50:50 chance of passing on the gene. Thus, with each <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/conception_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">conception</a>, there is a 25% chance for an average-size child, a 50% chance for a child (like them) with achondroplasia and a 25% chance for a conception with two achondroplasia genes. The combined presence of two genes for achondroplasia (called homozygous achondroplasia) causes a grievous skeletal disorder that leads to early death from breathing failure due to constriction by a tiny chest cage and neurologic problems from hydrocephalus.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_gene_causes_achondroplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene which codes for a protein (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) that is important for the maintenance of bone and brain tissues. 
Two specific mutations in this gene are responsible for almost all cases of 
achondroplasia. These mutations limit the process of ossification, or the formation of bone from cartilage. The FGFR3 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 in chromosome band 4p16.3.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
