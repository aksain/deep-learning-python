People with polycythemia have an increase in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hematocrit/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hematocrit</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemoglobin</a>, or red blood cell count above the normal limits.</p>.<p>Polycythemia is normally reported in terms of increased hematocrit (hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of red blood cells to the total volume of blood) or hemoglobin concentration (hemoglobin is a protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood).</p>.<p>Polycythemia can be divided into two categories; primary and secondary.</p>.<p>Red cell production (erythropoiesis) takes place in the bone marrow through a complex sequence of tightly regulated steps. The main regulator of the red cell production is the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). This hormone is largely secreted by the kidneys, although, about 10% may be produced and secreted by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>.</p>.<p>Erythropoietin secretion is up-regulated in response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) in the blood. More oxygen can be carried to tissues when erythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow to compensate for the hypoxia.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Neonatal</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">newborn</a>) polycythemia can be seen in 1% to 5% of newborns. The most common causes may be related to transfusion of blood, transfer of placental blood to the infant after delivery, or chronic inadequate oxygenation of the fetus (intrauterine hypoxia) due to placental insufficiency.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_normal_ranges_of_hematocrit_red_cell_counts_and_hemoglobin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Causes of polycythemia are primary or secondary. In primary polycythemia, abnormalities in red blood cell production cause an increase in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red cell count</a>. In secondary polycythemia, factors external to red blood cell production (for example, hypoxia, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep apnea</a>, certain tumors) result in polycythemia.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_primary_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary polycythemias are due to acquired or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> genetic mutations causing abnormally high levels of red blood cell precursors. Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) and polycythemia vera (PV) are in this category.</p>.<p>Polycythemia vera is a rare condition. One study indicated that there were 65,243 patients with PV in the United States in 2003. Polycythemia vera is typically associated with an elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">platelet count</a> (thrombocytosis). An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enlarged spleen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">splenomegaly</a>) and low erythropoietin levels are other clinical features of polycythemia vera.</p>.<p>Until recently, the exact mechanism of polycythemia vera was not well understood. In 2005, genetic mutations of the JAK2 gene were found to be responsible for most cases of polycythemia vera. These mutations are thought to possibly increase the sensitivity of the red blood cell precursors to erythropoietin, thereby, increasing red blood cell production.</p>.<p>Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) is also thought to be caused by genetic mutations resulting in increased responsiveness to normal levels of erythropoietin. Most cases are caused by different mutations to the EPOR gene.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_common_causes_of_secondary_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Secondary polycythemia is usually due to increased erythropoietin (EPO) production either in response to chronic hypoxia (low blood oxygen level) or from an erythropoietin secreting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a>.</p>.<p>Common conditions causing chronic hypoxia are chronic lung diseases such as:</p>.<p>Abnormal blood flow to the kidneys can be perceived by the kidneys as decreased oxygenation (renal hypoxia), even though, other tissues may have normal oxygenation. Renal hypoxia may promote an increase in erythropoietin production. This condition can occur after kidney transplantation or narrowing of renal arteries (blood vessels supplying the kidneys).</p>.<p>People living in high altitudes can develop polycythemia. In high altitudes, increased red blood cell production occurs in order to compensate for the low ambient oxygen levels and inadequate tissue oxygenation.</p>.<p>Rare <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">congenital defects</a> in the hemoglobin molecule, such as 2, 3-BPG deficiency, can result in a higher oxygen affinity by hemoglobin. In these conditions, oxygen is held on tightly by hemoglobin and is less readily released from hemoglobin to the tissues. The resulting tissue hypoxia from poor oxygen delivery may lead to polycythemia.</p>.<p>Certain tumors can release increased amount of erythropoietin. The most common erythropoietin secreting tumors are:</p>.<p>Occasionally, benign kidney <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cysts</a> and kidney obstruction (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydronephrosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hydronephrosis</a>) can also secrete extra erythropoietin causing polycythemia.</p>.<p>A rare genetic condition, called Chuvash polycythemia, causes increased activity of the gene that produces erythropoietin. The overproduction of erythropoietin causes polycythemia.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_other_sources_of_erythropoietin_epo_cause_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Erythropoietin (EPO) has been made synthetically for clinical treatment of certain types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>. Some professional athletes have used this type of injectable EPO (blood doping) to improve their performance in competitions by producing more hemoglobin and, therefore, improving the delivery of oxygen to their tissues, mainly muscles. This type of doping practice is banned by many professional sport committees.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_relative_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In some forms of secondary polycythemia, the hemoglobin or red blood cell count is perceived to be abnormally high due to an increased concentration of blood.

Repeating the laboratory tests (blood work) to confirm the diagnosis is usually advised to rule out possible laboratory or drawing errors.</p>.<p>More importantly, the cause of polycythemia needs to be determined. Medical history and physical examination are important components of the evaluation of polycythemia. The history usually includes questions about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">smoking</a> history, living at high altitudes for extended periods, breathing difficulties, sleep disturbances, or chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>. Other parts of the history may focus on a prior diagnosis of lung disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, kidney or liver <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a>, bleeding or clotting problems.</p>.<p>A complete physical examination including the assessment of body habitus (stature), vital signs, oxygen saturation, heart and lung exams, and evaluating for an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) are essential in the evaluation of people with polycythemia.</p>.<p>Evidence of a long standing low body oxygen level (chronic hypoxia) is an important clue in patients with polycythemia. Signs of long standing hypoxia may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyanosisturning_blue/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cyanosis</a> (blue or purple appearing finger, nail, earlobes, or lips), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nail_clubbing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">clubbing</a> of the fingers (elevation of the nail beds outward), or pursed lip breathing.

Hemoglobin analysis may be necessary if conditions with high affinity for oxygen or 2, 3-BPG deficiency are suspected. If carbon monoxide poisoning is in question, its level can be detected by a blood test.</p>.<p>Erythropoietin (EPO) blood levels may also be helpful, although the results need to be interpreted carefully as the level may be high in response to chronic hypoxia. In polycythemia vera, the EPO levels are low as a response to an increased production of red blood cells. In tumors secreting erythropoietin, the EPO levels may be abnormally high.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of <b>polycythemia vera</b> requires special attention. There have been traditional diagnostic criteria for this condition. However, in 2008, the world health organization (WHO) established the most recent guidelines. The guidelines include major and minor criteria.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for polycythemia is generally dependent on the cause.</p>.<p>In polycythemia vera or other primary polycythemia syndromes, the treatment options are more specific. Phlebotomy (drawing blood or blood letting) is the most essential part of the treatment. The recommended hematocrit of less than 45 in men and less than 42 in women is the goal of phlebotomy.</p>.<p>Several medications have been considered in conjunction with phlebotomy to suppress the abnormal production of red blood cells. Most of these chemotherapeutic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> have been linked with side effects and their use has been controversial and limited.</p>.<p>The medication hydroxyurea (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyurea-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Hydrea</a>) has been recommended for some patients with primary polycythemia and higher risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> formation due to high blood viscosity. The factors favoring treatment with hydroxyurea are age greater than 70, platelet count greater than 1.5 million, and general cardiovascular risk factors.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aspirin</a> and other anti-platelet agents (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dipyridamole-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dipyridamole</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dipyridamole-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Persantine</a>]) may also be beneficial in patients with polycythemia by reducing clotting complications, unless the patient has a history of bleeding problems.</p>.<p>In patients with secondary polycythemia, the goal is to treat the underlying condition. For example, in patients with lung or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">heart disease</a> with hypoxia, appropriate management of these conditions along with oxygen supplementation is generally advised.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_polycythemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Potential complications of polycythemia vera is increased levels of circulating red blood cells, which increases the thickness or viscosity of the blood. This can be associated with higher risk of thrombus or clot formation leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strokes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_embolism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pulmonary embolism</a>, and possibly death.</p>.<p>Another complication of polycythemia vera is the potential transformation into a blood cancer (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leukemia</a>), excessive bleeding (hemorrhage), or clotting problems.</p>.<p>Because of high turnover of blood cells in polycythemia, the excretion of the byproducts of red blood cell degradation may over burden the kidneys and result in kidney dysfunction, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney stones</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gout</a>.</p>.<p>Finally, there is the potential for myelofibrosis (spent marrow), in which the blood-forming marrow elements are eventually taken over by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar tissue</a> resulting in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anemia</a> from marrow failure.</p>.<p>Complications of secondary polycythemia are typically related to those of the underlying disease. For example, chronic hypoxia from severe lung disease may be complicated by right sided <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a> and pulmonary hypertension. Chronic heart failure can lead to generalized swelling or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a> (anasarca), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a>, kidney dysfunction, and poor functional status.</p>.<p>In neonatal (infant) polycythemia, increased blood thickness or viscosity can affect several organs due to poor blood flow.

Overall the general outlook is favorable for people with this condition, especially those with secondary causes. The outlook for primary polycythemia is fair. While it is typically incurable and long-standing, for many people, it is controllable and treatable. For example, untreated, polycythemia vera (PV) was initially thought to have a poor prognosis with a life expectancy of one to two years from the time of diagnosis. However, polycythemia vera prognosis is now greatly improved to 10-15 years survival after diagnosis with treatment by phlebotomy alone. The addition of medications, such as, hydroxyurea or aspirin may improve survival even more.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
