A seizure usually involves convulsions and sometimes leads to loss of 
consciousness. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_an_epileptic_seizure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Seizures occur due to a malfunction of the brain's electrical system. Some 
seizures are caused by brain diseases, tumors, 
genetic conditions, or other 
illnesses or disorders that can be diagnosed (symptomatic seizures). When the 
cause for the seizures is unknown, they are referred to as idiopathic or 
cryptogenic seizures. </p>.<p>Seizure causes are also sub-classified into acute (an active cause, such as 
an active brain disease) or remote (caused by a previous event, such as injury).
</p>.<p>Some people with seizure disorders have triggers that cause their seizures. 
Common seizure triggers include foods or medications, hormones, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, 
lack of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>, or sensitivity to light. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_an_epileptic_seizure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generalized seizure symptoms include unconsciousness, muscle contractions and 
convulsions (which may appear as very dramatic jerking movements), tongue or lip 
biting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence_in_women_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">incontinence</a>, and clouded awareness. There may be weakness or loss of 
sensation. These symptoms may be brief or last a longer period of time. </p>.<p>Some seizures only cause minor or mild symptoms and can be localized to a 
specific area of the body. These are called partial seizures. Symptoms of a 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epilepsy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">partial seizure</a> may include an aura (a warning symptom, often a strange 
sensation in the stomach), lip smacking, fidgeting, lack of awareness of 
surroundings, confusion, and sleepiness after the seizure. These symptoms 
typically last 30 seconds to 2 minutes. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_first_aid_should_be_done_for_an_epileptic_seizure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>First aid for a seizure is aimed at keeping the person safe until the seizure stops on its own. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_to_prevent_an_epileptic_seizure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There may be some ways to prevent seizures in some people.
