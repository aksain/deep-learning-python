type of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). It is resistant to almost all 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> used to treat TB, including the two best first-line drugs: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/isoniazid_inh/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">isoniazid</a> and 
rifampin. XDR TB is also resistant to the best second-line medications: 
fluoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, 
kanamycin, or capreomycin). </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_xdr_tb_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Drug-susceptible (regular) TB and XDR TB are spread the 
same way. TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> or throat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughs</a>, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These germs can float in the 
air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the 
air containing these TB germs can become infected. </p>.<p>TB is not spread by</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_xdr_tb_so_serious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Because XDR TB is resistant to the most powerful first-line and 
second-line drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less 
effective and often have worse treatment outcomes. XDR TB is of special concern 
for persons with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a> infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune 
system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are 
infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB disease. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_for_getting_xdr_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Drug-resistant TB (MDR or XDR) is more 
common in people who: </p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_prevent_myself_from_getting_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Avoid close contact or 
prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments like 
clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. </p>.<p><b><a name="can_the_tb_vaccine_bcg_help_prevent_xdr_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
There is a vaccine for TB 
disease called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). It is used in some countries to 
prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally 
recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for 
preventing TB in adults. The effect of BCG against XDR TB would likely be 
similar to the effect on drug-susceptible TB. </p>.<p><b><a name="if_i_have_regular_drug-susceptible_tb_how_can_i_prevent_getting_drug-resistant_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
The most important thing is for you to continue taking all 
your TB medicines exactly as prescribed. No doses should be missed and treatment 
should not be stopped early. You should tell your health care provider if you 
are having trouble taking the medications. If you plan to travel, make sure you 
have enough medicine to last while away. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_xdr_tb_be_treated_and_cured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Yes, in some cases. Some TB control programs 
have shown that cure is possible for an estimated 30% of affected people. 
Successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antibiotic_resistance/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drug resistance</a>, the 
severity of the disease, and whether the patient's immune system is weakened.
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_xdr_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The general symptoms of TB disease include 
feelings of sickness or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/night_sweats/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">night sweats</a>. The 
symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a>, and 
coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on 
the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or 
local health department. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_i_have_been_around_someone_who_has_xdr_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
If you think 
you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor 
or local health department about getting a TB skin test or the QuantiFERONÂ®-TB 
Gold test (QFT-G), a blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent 
time with this person. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_it_take_to_find_out_if_you_have_xdr_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
If TB bacteria are 
found in the sputum (phlegm), the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two, 
but this finding will not be able to distinguish between drug-susceptible 
(regular) TB and drug-resistant TB. To determine drug susceptibility, the 
bacteria need to be grown and tested in a laboratory. Final diagnosis for TB, 
and especially for XDR TB, may take from 6 to 16 weeks. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_xdr_tb_a_problem_in_the_united_states" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
The risk of acquiring XDR TB in the 
United States appears to be relatively low. However, it is important to 
acknowledge the ease at which TB can spread. As long as XDR TB exists, the 
United States is at risk and must address the threat. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_many_cases_of_xdr_tb_have_been_reported_in_the_united_states" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the 
United States, 49 cases of XDR TB have been reported between 1993 and 2006. </p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_safe_to_travel_where_cases_of_xdr_tb_have_been_reported" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Although MDR 
and XDR TB are occurring globally, they are still rare. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a>-infected travelers 
are at greatest risk if they come in contact with a person with MDR or XDR TB.
</p>.<p>All travelers should avoid high risk settings where there are no infection 
control measures in place. Documented places where transmission has occurred 
include crowded hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, and other settings where 
susceptible persons come in contact with persons with TB disease. </p>.<p>Air travel itself carries a relatively low risk of infection with TB of any 
kind. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_health_care_providers_do_to_prevent_xdr_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Health care providers 
can help prevent MDR and XDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following 
recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients' response to treatment, 
and making sure therapy is completed. </p>.<p>Providers should also ensure proper implementation of infection control 
procedures to prevent exposure to TB in hospitals or health-care settings where 
TB patients are likely to be seen. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_immigrants_putting_the_us_at_increased_risk_for_tb" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Persons applying to 
enter the U.S. with immigrant or refugee visas must complete a questionnaire 
about any symptoms of TB they may have and obtain a chest radiograph. If 
positive, the person submits sputum specimens for examination for TB bacteria. 
Persons identified as having infectious TB are not granted entry to the United 
States, until they have been treated. </p>.<p><b><a name="why_havent_we_heard_about_xdr_tb_before_now" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
For some years we have seen 
isolated cases of very highly resistant TB around the world that we would today 
call XDR TB. The drugs used to treat TB have been around a long time and drug 
resistance has taken many years to develop. Over time, countries have improved 
their laboratory capacity to test for drug resistance and their ability to track 
the number of cases. All of these factors have contributed to an increase in 
reporting of cases of drug-resistant TB. With more cases being identified, the 
problem was more closely examined, defined, and given a name. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_cdc_doing_to_prevent_xdr_tb_from_becoming_a_bigger_problem" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
