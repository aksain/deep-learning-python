Dry eye syndrome can affect any race and is more common in women than in men. Another term used for dry eye is ocular surface disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_impact_of_dry_eye_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>More than 3 million American women over the age of 50 have moderate to severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eye/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dry eyes</a>, while more than 1.5 million American men over the age of 50 are similarly afflicted. Millions of others have mild dry eyes. In the majority of these people, this health condition is benign and easily treated with artificial tears.</p>.<p>Many wearers of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contact lenses</a> experience dry eyes at some point with many discontinuing or limiting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lens</a> wear. Dry eye is a significant finding in patients having undergone refractive surgery, especially <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lasik_eye_surgery/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">LASIK</a>.</p>.<p>In addition to affecting ocular health, the discomfort and irritation of dry eyes can cause deterioration of general well-being, emotional health, and social functioning. Studies have demonstrated that people with dry eye syndrome are three times more likely than those without dry eyes to have difficulty with reading, computer work, watching TV, and driving. Direct costs of dry eyes, such as frequent physician visits, diagnostic tests, and charges for medication and surgery impact our health care resources. In addition, there are immeasurable indirect costs related to decreased productivity and efficiency and lost work time.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_dry_eye_syndrome_what_are_the_types_of_dry_eye_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dry eye syndrome is a common disorder of the normal tear film that results from decreased tear production, excessive tear evaporation, and an abnormality in the production of mucus or lipids normally found in the tear layer, or a combination of these. Aqueous (watery) tear deficiency is caused by either poor production of watery tears or excessive evaporation of the watery tear layer. Poor production of tears by the tear glands may be a result of age, hormonal changes, or various autoimmune diseases, such as primary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sjogrens_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Sjögren's syndrome</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>. Evaporative loss of the watery tear layer is usually a result of an insufficient overlying lipid layer.</p>.<p>Some medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antidepressants</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta-blockers</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">oral contraceptives</a>, may decrease tear production.</p>.<p>If blinking decreases or if the eyelids cannot be closed, the eyes may dry out because of tear evaporation. While reading, watching TV, or performing a task that requires close attention with the eyes, a person may not blink as often. This decreased blinking allows excessive evaporation of the tears. Certain health conditions, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/facial_nerve_problems/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Bell's palsy</a>, make it difficult to close the eyes. As a result, the eyes may become dry from tear evaporation.</p>.<p>Abnormal production of mucin by the conjunctiva may occur. This can result from chemical (alkali) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a> to the eye or because of different autoimmune diseases, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cicatricial pemphigoid. This abnormal production leads to poor spreading of the tears over the surface of the eye. The surface of the eye can dry out and even become damaged despite the presence of sufficient watery tears.</p>.<p>Insufficient lipid layers are the result of meibomian gland dysfunction, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rosacea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rosacea</a>, or following oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/isotretinoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">isotretinoin</a> medication. Meibomian glands are the oil glands in the eyelids that produce the lipid layer. If these oil glands become blocked or if the oil is too thick, there may not be enough oil to cover the watery tear layer to prevent its evaporation.</p>.<p>In addition, if an infection is present along the eyelids or the eyelashes (called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blepharitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blepharitis</a>) the bacteria may break down the oil, so there may not be enough oil.

With dry eye, when the eyes becomes slightly dry and irritated, it may initiate reflex tearing with the production of a large amount of tears all at once to try to get moist and comfortable again. Unfortunately, the eyes can only handle so many tears at any one time; the rest pour over the eyelids and down the cheeks.

A health care professional can confirm the diagnosis of dry eyes by observing signs of dry eyes. As part of the eye examination, a doctor may</p>.<p>An ophthalmologist may use different dyes during a patient's eye examination. An eye care specialist will place the dyes into the tears in the form of a drop. Fluorescein is a yellow dye that stains the cornea where epithelial (surface) cells have been worn away because of the lack of an adequate protective tear film. Rose Bengal is a red dye that stains the cornea and the conjunctiva where the cells are dead or dying as well as where healthy cells are inadequately protected by the tear film. Lissamine Green is a green dye that can help differentiate between normal and abnormal surface cells of the cornea and conjunctiva.</p>.<p>Schirmer tests measure the amount of tears produced by the eyes. The ophthalmologist places the end of a thin strip of filter paper just inside the lower <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a>. After a minute, the doctor removes the filter paper, and the amount of wetting is measured. Less wetting of the filter paper is more indicative of dry eye syndrome.</p>.<p>The osmolarity (salt content) of the tears may be measured. This is a new test that aids in the diagnosis of dry eye syndrome, in which tear osmolarity is increased over normal levels.</p>.<p>Another new test on the tears can detect the presence of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), a substance which, when present in the tears, is a reliable marker for the presence of early ocular surface disease and dry eye. This test may be helpful to identify patients with ocular surface inflammation and autoimmune disease and may facilitate the decision to institute anti-inflammatory treatment in these patients. If autoimmune diseases or Sjögren's syndrome are suspected as a cause of a patient's dry eye syndrome, blood tests may be performed. These blood tests check for the presence of different autoantibodies that may be associated with dry eye syndrome.</p>.<p>Rarely, a doctor may perform a biopsy of the salivary glands. Certain disease processes, such as Sjögren's syndrome, affect both the salivary glands, which produce saliva in your mouth, and the lacrimal glands, which produce tears.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_over-the-counter_medical_treatments_for_dry_eye_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although no cure exists for dry eye syndrome, many medical treatments are available.

A humidifier puts more moisture into the air. With more moisture in the air, tears evaporate more slowly, keeping the eyes more comfortable. Both furnaces in the winter and air conditioning in the summer decrease the humidity in the air. Excessive air movement dries out the eyes. Avoid having excessive air movement by decreasing the speed of ceiling fans and/or oscillating fans. Large amounts of dust or other particulate matter in the air may worsen the symptoms of dry eye. In those situations, an air filter may be helpful.</p>.<p>Warm compresses and eyelid scrubs/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/massage_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">massage</a> with baby shampoo help by providing a thicker, more stable lipid layer. This is especially helpful if a person has meibomian gland dysfunction, rosacea, or blepharitis. The heat (careful, warm compresses should not be too hot; the compress should be comfortable if placed on your wrist) warms up the oil in the oil glands, making it flow more easily; the mild massaging action helps get the oil out of the glands. The cleansing action decreases the number of bacteria that break down the oil.</p>.<p>Artificial tears and lubricating eyedrops and gels (available over the counter) help provide more moisture and lubrication for the surface of the eye. Individuals typically use lubricating eyedrops about four times a day, but they can be used as often as needed. Doctors recommend preservative-free solutions for those who wish to use tears more than six times a day. There is no single over-the-counter drop that is best for everybody. Each individual will determine which drop provides the most relief from symptoms. Some drops may have a longer time effect than others.</p>.<p>Lubricating eye ointments are much thicker than eye drops and gels. Because ointments are so thick, they last much longer than eye drops and gels. However, because of their thickness, ointments may blur vision if people use them during the day. Therefore, people typically use ointments to lubricate the eyes overnight during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>.</p>.<p>If the eyes are dry mainly while reading or watching TV, taking frequent breaks to allow the eyes to rest and become moist and comfortable again is helpful.

Removing environmental influences or reducing contact lens wear does not provide relief.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_surgery_treat_dry_eye_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different minor surgical procedures may help decrease dry eye syndrome. Near the inner corner of each eyelid are tiny openings, called punctae, that are the beginning of the normal tear drainage system. From there, tears normally flow through naso-lacrimal ducts into the nose. Punctal occlusion helps by decreasing the normal drainage of the tears from the ocular surface and down the tear drainage system, into the back of the nose, and down the throat. This occlusion is usually done by a very simple office procedure and only takes a few minutes. An eye care professional can place different punctal plugs or lacrimal canalicular plugs at or just inside these openings to block the normal drainage of tears down the tear drainage system. Just like a stopper placed in the drain of a sink keeps the water from flowing down the drain, these plugs keep the tears from flowing down the tear drainage system. Therefore, the eyes stay more moist and comfortable, even if one has fewer tears. Ophthalmologists can remove these plugs very easily, if necessary. Sometimes, in severe cases of dry eye syndrome, eye care professionals permanently close these openings, usually by cautery (burning) or laser. This accomplishes the same thing as the plugs, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.</p>.<p>If a person has difficulty closing the eyes for any reason, such as Bell's palsy, the eyes may dry out because of tear evaporation. Lateral tarsorrhaphy is a procedure during which the lateral (outside) one-third of the eyelids are sewn together to decrease the ability of the eye to open widely and to help the eyes close more easily. If <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">stroke</a> or nerve damage keeps the eyelids from closing properly, a doctor may implant a small gold weight into the upper eyelid to help it close.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_other_therapies_that_treat_dry_eye_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sometimes, people <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> with their eyes slightly open.
