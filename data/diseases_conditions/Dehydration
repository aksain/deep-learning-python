<p><b><a name="dehydration_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_dehydration" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Water is a critical element of the body, and keeping the body adequately hydrated is a must to allow the body to function. Up to 60% of the body's weight is made up of water. Most of the water is found within the cells of the body (intracellular space). The rest is found in the extracellular space, which consists of the blood vessels (intravascular space) and the spaces between cells (interstitial space).</p>.<p>Dehydration occurs when the amount of water leaving the body is greater than the amount being taken in. The body is very dynamic and always changing. This is especially true with water in the body. We lose water routinely when we:</p>.<p>In a normal day, a person has to drink a significant amount of water to replace this routine loss.</p>.<p>The formula for daily fluid requirements depends upon an individual's weight. Normally, fluid and weight are calculated using the metric system; however, below is the approximation in imperial (American) units.</p>.<p></p>.<p></p>.<p>If you would like to calculate your body weight and daily fluid requirements using the metric system, please use this formula.</p>.<p>This is the basic body requirement. More fluid would be needed to replace excess <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a> from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, fluid loss from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a> or increased urine production.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_dehydration" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dehydration occurs because there is too much water lost, not enough water taken in, or most commonly, a combination of the two.</p>.<p><b><a name="dehydration_pictures" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The body is able to monitor the amount of fluid it needs to function. The 
thirst mechanism signals the body to drink water when the body is dry. Moreover, 
hormones like anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) work with the kidney to limit the 
amount of water lost in the urine when the body needs to conserve water 
(diuretic = increased excretion of water).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_dehydration" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The body's initial responses to dehydration are thirst to increase water 
intake, and decreased urine output to try to conserve water loss. The urine 
will become concentrated and more yellow in color.</p>.<p>As the level of water loss increases, more symptoms can become apparent. The 
following are further signs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">symptoms of dehydration</a>.</p>.<p>The body tries to maintain cardiac output (the amount of blood that is pumped by the heart to the body); and if the amount of fluid in the intravascular space is decreased, the body compensates for this decrease by increasing the heart rate and making blood vessels constrict to try to maintain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> and blood flow to the vital organs of the body. 
The body shunts blood flow away from the skin to internal organs, for example, 
the brain, heart, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>, kidneys, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a>; causing the skin to feel cool 
and clammy. This coping mechanism begins to fail as the level of dehydration increases.</p>.<p>With severe dehydration, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a> and 
weakness will occur as the brain and 
other body organs receive less blood flow. Finally, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coma</a>, organ failure, 
and death eventually will occur 
if the dehydration remains untreated.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_dehydration_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Millions of children die worldwide each year because of dehydration, often because of diarrhea. The temperature regulation and sweat mechanism of infants are not well developed, and this increases their risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthermia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heat-related illness</a>.</p>.<p>It is important to remember that infants and children are dependent upon others to provide them with water and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">nutrition</a>. Infants cannot tell their parents or care providers when they are thirsty. Enough fluid needs to be provided so that the dehydration can be prevented. This is especially true if increased water loss occurs because of fever, vomiting or diarrhea.</p>.<p>In children, symptoms of dehydration increase as the level of dehydration increases.</p>.<p></p>.<p>Infants and children respond well to fluid replacement, and often oral rehydration therapy (ORT) can treat dehydration. Small, frequent sips of fluid replacement solutions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolyte_solution-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pedialyte</a> or Gatorade may be enough to prevent the need for intravenous fluids. In ORT, replacement begins with 5cc or one teaspoon of fluid every 5-10 minutes. If this is tolerated without vomiting, the amount of fluid is doubled, again providing small amounts every few minutes. However, if the child is too ill to drink or cannot tolerate even small sips of fluid, medical care should be accessed immediately.</p>.<p>Intravenous fluids can rehydrate the infant or child while the underlying illness is evaluated and treated. Occasionally, there is difficulty in placing an intravenous line and an intraosseous (inside the bone) needle can be placed, usually in the tibia (shin bone) that allows fluid resuscitation.</p>.<p>In children who are markedly dehydrated, blood tests may be used to monitor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolytes</a>, kidney function, and acid-base balance in the body.</p>.<p>It is important to find the reason for the illness because dehydration is the result of a disease process, not the cause of it.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_dehydration_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dehydration is often a clinical diagnosis. Aside from diagnosing the reason for dehydration, the health care professional's examination of the patient will assess the level of dehydration. Initial evaluations may include:</p>.<p>The purpose of blood tests is to assess potential electrolyte abnormalities (including sodium, potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide levels) associated with the dehydration. Other tests may or may not be ordered depending upon the underlying cause of dehydration, the severity of illness, and the health care professional's assessment of their needs and available resources.</p>.<p>Other blood tests may be helpful in determining the level of dehydration. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Hemoglobin</a> and red blood cell counts may be elevated because the blood is more concentrated with water loss from the intravascular space.</p>.<p>Kidney function tests including BUN and creatinine may be elevated, and this is one way of measuring the severity of dehydration.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinalysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Urinalysis</a> may be ordered to determine urine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">concentration</a>; the more concentrated the urine, the more dehydrated the patient.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_dehydration_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As is often the case in medicine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> is the important first step in 
the treatment of dehydration. (Please see the home treatment and prevention 
sections.)</p>.<p>Fluid replacement is the treatment for dehydration. This may be attempted by 
replacing fluid by mouth, but if this fails, intravenous fluid (IV) may be 
required. Should oral rehydration be attempted, frequent small amounts of clear fluids 
should be used. </p>.<p>Clear fluids include most things you can see through.</p>.<p>Decisions about the use of intravenous fluids depend upon the health care 
professional's assessment of the extent of dehydration, the ability for the 
patient to drink fluids by mouth, and the ability for the 
patient to recover from the underlying cause. </p>.<p>The success of the rehydration therapy can be monitored by urine output. When 
the body is dry, the kidneys try to hold on to as much fluid as possible, urine 
output is decreased, and the urine itself is concentrated. As treatment occurs 
and if it is successful, 
the kidneys sense the increased amount of fluid within the intravascular space and urine output increases.</p>.<p>Medications may be used to treat underlying illnesses and to control fever, 
vomiting, or diarrhea.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_i_treat_dehydration_at_home" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dehydration occurs over time. If it can be recognized in its earliest stages, 
and if its cause can be addressed, home treatment may be beneficial and adequate.</p>.<p>Steps a person can take at home to prevent severe dehydration include:</p>.<p>If the person becomes confused or lethargic; if there is persistent, 
uncontrolled fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; or if there are any other specific 
concerns, then medical care should be accessed. </p>.<p>Emergency medical system (EMS) or 911 should be activated for any individual with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/altered_mental_status/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">altered mental status</a> - 
confusion, lethargy, or coma.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_dehydration" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications of dehydration may occur because of the consequences of dehydration, and/or because of the underlying disease or situation that causes the fluid loss.</p>.<p>
 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Kidney failure</a> is a common occurrence 
and often is reversible, if it is due to dehydration and is treated early. As dehydration progresses, the volume of fluid in the 
body decreases, and blood pressure may fall. This can decrease blood flow to vital organs 
including the kidneys, and like any organ with a decreased blood flow; it has the potential to fail to do its job.
</p>.<p>
Decreased blood supply to the brain may cause 
confusion and even 
coma. 
</p>.<p>
When the fluid loss overwhelms the body's ability to compensate, blood flow and 
oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs become inadequate and cell and organ 
function can begin to fail. 
If enough organs begin to malfunction, the body itself may fail and death can 
occur.</p>.<p>
In heat-related illness, the body's attempt to cool itself by sweating may cause dehydration to the point that muscles may go into spasm (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heat_cramps/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heat cramps</a>). It is often the muscles that are being stressed that will spasm (for example, in people who work outside in a hot environment, arm and leg muscles may spasm from lifting and moving heavy objects or equipment; in athletes, leg muscles may 
cramp from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">running</a>). As fluid loss increases, the symptoms of
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heat_exhaustion/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heat exhaustion</a> can occur 
and include weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, and vomiting. If the symptoms are 
recognized and the patient isn't moved from the heat and rehydrated,
the situation may progress to
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heat_stroke/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heat stroke</a>. The 
patient will stop sweating, have a change in mental status that includes 
confusion and coma, and the body temperature may spike to 106 F (41 C) or 
higher. Heat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> is a true medical emergency and 911 or the 
emergency response system should be activated immediately in this situation.
</p>.<p>
In dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities may occur since important chemicals (like sodium, potassium, 
and chloride) are lost from the body through sweat. For example, patients with profuse diarrhea or 
vomiting may lose significant amounts of potassium, causing muscle weakness and heart rhythm disturbances.  The 
health care professional may decide to monitor electrolyte levels by checking blood tests. Examples of symptoms caused by abnormal electrolyte levels include muscle weakness due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_potassium_hypokalemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low potassium</a>, 
heart rhythm disturbances due to either low or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperkalemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high potassium</a>, and
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a> due to low (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyponatremia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyponatremia</a>) 
or high sodium (hypernatremia). In many patients with dehydration, the kidneys are able to 
compensate and regulate electrolyte levels.</p>.<p>
It is important to remember that dehydration does not occur quickly, and sometimes it may take hours to slowly correct the fluid deficit and allow the electrolytes to redistribute themselves appropriately in the different spaces in the body. If rehydration is done too slowly, the patient may remain hypotensive and in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shock</a> for too long. If done too quickly, water and electrolyte concentrations within organ cells can be negatively affected, causing cells to swell and eventually 
become damaged.
