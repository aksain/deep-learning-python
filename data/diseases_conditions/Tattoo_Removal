<p><b><a name="#introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is estimated that close to 10% of the U.S. population 
has some sort of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tattoo_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tattoo</a>. Eventually, as many as 50% of them want to have laser 
tattoo removal.</p>.<p>There is good news for those who have an unwanted body design. 
Newer laser tattoo removal techniques can eliminate your tattoo with minimal 
side effects. Here's how it works: lasers remove tattoos by breaking up the 
pigment colors of the tattoo with a high-intensity light beam.</p>.<p>Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_can_benefit_from_laser_tattoo_removal" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because each tattoo is unique, removal techniques 
must be tailored to suit each individual case. In the past, tattoos could be 
removed by a wide variety of methods but, in many cases, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scars</a> were more 
unsightly than the tattoo itself.</p>.<p>Patients with previously treated tattoos may 
also be candidates for laser therapy. Tattoos that have not been effectively 
removed by other treatments or through home remedies may respond well to laser 
therapy providing the prior treatments did not result in excessive scarring.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_find_a_reputable_doctor_to_do_laser_tattoo_removal" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
To have a tattoo removed, you want to make sure you find a reputable dermatologist or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic_surgery_cosmetic_surgery/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cosmetic surgery</a> center to ensure proper treatment and care. If possible, you should obtain a recommendation from your family doctor for a dermatologist or skin surgery center that specializes in tattoo removal.

the size and color of your tattoo, the number of treatments will vary. Your 
tattoo may be removed in two to four visits, though many more sessions may be 
necessary. You should schedule a consultation, during which time a trained 
professional will evaluate your personal situation and advise you on the 
process.</p>.<p>Treatment with the laser varies from patient to patient depending on 
the age, size and type of tattoo (amateur or professional). The color of the patient's skin, as well as the depth to which the tattoo pigment extends, will 
also affect the removal technique.</p>.<p>In general, this is what will happen during 
an office visit for tattoo removal using the newer lasers:</p>.<p>Most patients do not require any anesthesia. However, depending on the 
location of the tattoo and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> threshold for the patient, the physician may 
elect to use some form of anesthesia (topical anesthesia cream or painkiller 
injections at the site of the procedure).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_possible_side_effects_of_tattoo_removal" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are minimal side effects to laser tattoo 
removal. However, you should consider these factors in your decision:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_laser_tattoo_removal_safe" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Thanks to newer technology, laser tattoo removal has become much more effective with very little risk of scarring. Laser treatment is often safer than many traditional methods such as excision, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dermabrasion/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dermabrasion</a> or salabrasion (using moist gauze pads saturated with a salt solution to abrade the tattooed area) because of its unique ability to selectively treat pigment involved in the tattoo.</p>.<p>
In many cases, certain colors may be more effectively removed than others. It is known that blue/black tattoos respond particularly well to laser treatment -- the response of other colors is under investigation.</p>.<p>

Since tattoo removal is a personal option 
in most cases and is considered a cosmetic procedure, most insurance carriers 
will not cover the process unless it is medically necessary. Physicians or 
surgery centers practicing tattoo removal may also require payment in full on 
the day of the procedure. If you are considering tattoo removal, be sure to 
discuss associated costs up front and obtain all charges in 
writing before you undergo any treatment.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
