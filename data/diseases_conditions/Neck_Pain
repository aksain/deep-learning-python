Is the pain worsened or improved with turning or repositioning of the head? Any past injury to the neck and past treatments are noted. Aggravating and/or relieving positions or motions are also recorded. The neck is examined at rest and in motion. Tenderness is detected during palpation of the neck. An examination of the nervous system is performed to determine whether or not nerve involvement is present.</p>.<p>Further testing of undiagnosed neck pain can include X-ray evaluation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bone scan</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> scan, myelogram, and electrical tests such as electromyography (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electromyogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EMG</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nerve_conduction_velocity_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">nerve conduction velocity test</a> (NCV).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_neck_pain_what_are_home_remedies_for_neck_pain_relief" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of neck pain depends on its precise cause.
