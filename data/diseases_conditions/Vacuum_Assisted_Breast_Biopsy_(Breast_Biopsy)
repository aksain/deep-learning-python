<p><b><a name="breast_biopsy_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_breast_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">breast cancer</a>. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a>) tissue.</p>.<p>Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a>.</p>.<p>Imaging studies such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mammogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">mammography</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy.

When no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">breast cancer</a> is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_lumps_in_women/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast lumps</a> are cancerous.

The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_may_a_benign_result_indicate" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Among the most common benign growths in the breast are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cysts</a> (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">wart</a>-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> to the breast).

This technique can help distinguish between a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cyst</a> and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_anesthesia_needed_for_a_%0Abreast_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only).

In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_core_needle_biopsy_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_vacuum-assisted_breast_biopsy_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.</p>.<p>The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.</p>.<p>The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.</p>.<p>The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">stitches</a> for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_%0Asurgical_biopsy_of_the_breast_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:</p>.<p>The doctor closes the opening with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sutures</a> or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_time_frame_for_receiving_the_results_of_a_breast_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
