Saliva has enzymes that help digest food and antibodies that help protect against infections of the mouth and throat. There are 3 pairs of major salivary glands:</p>.<p>There are also hundreds of small (minor) salivary glands lining parts of the mouth, nose, and larynx that can be seen only with a microscope. Most small salivary gland tumors begin in the palate (roof of the mouth).</p>.<p>More than half of all salivary gland tumors are benign (not cancerous) and do not spread to other tissues.</p>.<p>Salivary gland cancer is a type of head and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_and_neck_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">neck cancer</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_increases_the_risk_of_salivary_gland_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnâ€™t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Although the cause of most salivary gland cancers is not known, risk factors include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_salivary_gland_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Salivary gland cancer may not cause any symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular dental check-up or physical exam. Symptoms caused by salivary gland cancer also may be caused by other conditions. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_exams_and_tests_are_used_to_detect_and_diagnose_salivary_gland_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following procedures may be used:</p>.<p>Because salivary gland cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have the tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing salivary gland cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_salivary_gland_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery) depend on the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_are_done_to_determine_if_salivary_gland_cancer_has_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the salivary glands or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_salivary_gland_cancer_spread_in_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if salivary gland cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually salivary gland cancer cells. The disease is metastatic salivary gland cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_stages_for_salivary_gland_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following stages are used for major salivary gland cancers:</p>.<p>In stage I, the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is 2 centimeters or smaller.</p>.<p>In stage II, the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters.</p>.<p>In stage III, one of the following is true:</p>.<p>Stage IV is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC as follows:</p>.<p>Salivary gland cancers are also grouped by grade. The grade of a tumor tells how fast the cancer cells are growing, based on how the cells look under a microscope. Low-grade cancers grow more slowly than high-grade cancers.</p>.<p>Minor salivary gland cancers are staged according to where they were first found in the body.</p>.<p>Recurrent salivary gland cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. Recurrent salivary gland cancer may come back in the salivary glands or in other parts of the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_salivary_gland_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are different types of treatment for patients with salivary gland cancer.</p>.<p>Different types of treatment are available for patients with salivary gland cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p>Patients with salivary gland cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating head and neck cancer.</p>.<p>Your treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. Because the salivary glands help in eating and digesting food, patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment. The medical oncologist may refer you to other doctors who have experience and expertise in treating patients with head and neck cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These include the following:</p>.<p>Three types of standard treatment are used:</p>.<p>Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for salivary gland cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around the cancer. In some cases, a lymphadenectomy (surgery in which lymph nodes are removed) will also be done.</p>.<p>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Special types of radiation may be used to treat some salivary gland tumors. These include:</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.</p>.<p>Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.</p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p>Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.</p>.<p>Follow-up tests may be needed.</p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_staging_affect_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for stage I salivary gland cancer depends on whether the cancer is low-grade (slow growing) or high-grade (fast growing).</p>.<p>If the cancer is low-grade, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p>If the cancer is high-grade, treatment may include the following:</p>.<p>Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with stage II salivary gland cancer.
