<p><b><a name="facial_nerve_problems_and_bells_palsy_definitions_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_facial_nerve" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The facial nerve is a nerve that controls the muscles on the side of the face. It allows us to show expression, smile, cry, and wink. Injury to the facial nerve can cause a socially and psychologically devastating physical defect; although most cases resolve spontaneously, treatment may ultimately require extensive rehabilitation or multiple procedures.</p>.<p>The facial nerve is the seventh of the twelve cranial nerves. Everyone has two facial nerves, one for each side of the face. The facial nerve travels with the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing</a> nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) as it travels in and around the structures of the middle ear. It exits the front of the ear at the stylomastoid foramen (a hole in the skull base), where it then travels through the parotid gland. In the parotid gland it divides into many branches that provide motor function for the various muscles and glands of the head and neck.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_of_a_facial_nerve_problem" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Facial nerve problems may result in facial muscle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">paralysis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, or twitching of the face. Dryness of the eye or the mouth, alteration of taste on the affected side, or even excessive tearing or salivation can be seen as well. However, the finding of one of these symptoms does not necessarily imply a specific facial nerve problem; the physician needs to make a careful investigation in order to make a precise diagnosis. Symptoms of a facial nerve problem can vary in severity depending upon the extent of the injury to the nerve. Symptoms may range from mild twitching to full paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_affect_the_facial_nerve" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are numerous causes of facial nerve disorder:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_causes_of_facial_nerve_dysfunction_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Causes of facial nerve disorder vary from unknown to life threatening. Sometimes, there is a specific treatment for the problem. Accordingly, it is important to investigate why the problem has occurred. The specific tests used for diagnosis will vary from patient to patient, but include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_bells_palsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bell's palsy (sometimes referred to as Bell palsy) is paralysis of the facial nerve of unknown cause. The diagnosis is made when no other cause can be identified. Although Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by a viral infection of the facial nerve, this hasn't been proven. Other names for this condition are "idiopathic facial palsy" or Antoni's palsy.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_a_person_get_bells_palsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the actual mechanism of injury of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy is unknown, one proposed mechanism of injury includes:</p>.<p><b><a name="bells_palsy_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The typical symptoms of Bell's palsy include:</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_bells_palsy_how_long_does_it_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bell's palsy is usually a self-limiting, non-life-threatening condition that resolves spontaneously, usually within six weeks. There is no predominant age or racial predilection; however, it is more common during pregnancy and slightly more common in menstruating females. In general, the incidence increases with advancing age. Children under the age of 13 seem less at risk of developing Bell's palsy than older individuals.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_bells_palsy_treated_how_is_facial_nerve_paralysis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no medications specifically approved to treat Bell's palsy. Underlying medical conditions that lead to facial nerve disorder are treated specifically according to the specific condition that is responsible for the damage to the nerve. Steroid medications (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroids</a>) are the best treatment for Bell's palsy, and it is recommended that all patients be treated. The usual amount is one milligram per kilogram body weight of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a> (or steroid alternative) per day for 7 to 14 days. Recently, antiviral medications like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acyclovir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zovirax</a>) given in conjunction with steroids have been demonstrated to increase recovery. Doses of the antiviral agent will vary with the drug chosen.</p>.<p>Although physical therapy and electrotherapy probably have no significant benefit, facial exercises can help prevent contractures of affected muscles. Surgical facial nerve decompression is controversial in Bell's palsy. Some physicians recommend surgical decompression during the first two weeks in patients showing the most severe nerve degeneration; however, there can be a substantial risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing loss</a> with this surgery.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_for_eye_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients with facial nerve paralysis have difficulty keeping their eye closed because the muscles which close the eye cannot work. Serious complications can occur if the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cornea</a> of the eye becomes too dry. Treatment consists of:</p>.<p><b><a name="surgical_reconstruction_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Reconstructive options for patients with facial muscle weakness or paralysis include one or more of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_cure_for_bells_palsy_what_is_the_prognosis_for_other_facial_nerve_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for facial nerve damage depends on the underlying cause. Many patients who have required surgery to remove tumors may have unavoidable permanent injury to the facial nerve, whereas a majority of persons who experience Bell's palsy will have complete recovery. The best outcomes occur with rapid diagnosis and treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_bells_palsy_and_other_facial_nerve_problems_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>At one time it was thought that exposure to cold air or a strong wind were predisposing factors leading to idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy); we now know that these ideas were incorrect. As the majority of causes for idiopathic facial nerve problems are unknown, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy specific items to avoid. Choosing a healthy lifestyle to decrease the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, or infection may help prevent some cases of facial nerve palsy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
