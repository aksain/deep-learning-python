By preventing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a>, the number of new cases of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a> in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.</p>.<p>To prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor.</p>.<p>Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For example, both <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a> and inheriting certain genes are risk factors for some types of cancer, but only <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">smoking</a> can be avoided. Regular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> and a healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> may be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does not mean that you will not get cancer.</p>.<p>Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:</p>.<p><b><a name="endometrial_cancer_is_a_disease_in_which_malignant_cancer_cells_form_in__the_tissues_of_the_endometrium" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">endometrium</a> is the lining of the uterus.

some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how 
you might lower your risk of cancer. </p>.<p><b>The following risk factors may increase the risk of endometrial cancer:</b>
</p>.<p><b>Estrogen</b> </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Estrogen</a> is a hormone made by the body. It helps the body develop and 
maintain female sex characteristics. Estrogen can affect the growth of some 
cancers, including endometrial cancer. A woman's risk of developing endometrial 
cancer is increased by being exposed to estrogen in the following ways: </p>.<p><b>Tamoxifen</b> </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tamoxifen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tamoxifen</a> is one of a group of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> called selective estrogen receptor 
modulators, or SERMs. Tamoxifen acts like estrogen on some tissues in the body, 
such as the uterus, but blocks the effects of estrogen on other tissues, such as 
the breast. When tamoxifen is used to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a> in women who are at 
high risk for the disease, it increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This 
risk is greater in postmenopausal women. </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/raloxifene/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Raloxifene</a> is a SERM that is used to prevent bone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a> in postmenopausal 
women. It does not have estrogen-like effects on the uterus and has not been 
shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Other SERMs are being studied 
in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">clinical trials</a>. </p>.<p><b>Inherited risk</b> </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HNPCC</a>) syndrome is an inherited 
disorder caused by changes in certain genes. Women who have HNPCC syndrome have 
a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have 
HNPCC syndrome. </p>.<p><b>Polycystic ovary syndrome</b> </p>.<p>Women who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/polycystic_ovary_syndrome_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">polycystic ovary syndrome</a> (a disorder of the hormones made by

is related to other risk factors such as estrogen levels, polycystic ovary 
syndrome, lack of physical activity, and a diet that is high in saturated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat_and_fats_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fats</a>.
</p>.<p>It is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.
</p>.<p><b>The following protective factors may decrease the risk of endometrial 
cancer:</b> </p>.<p><b>Combination oral contraceptives</b> </p>.<p>Taking contraceptives that combine estrogen and progestin (combination oral 
contraceptives) decreases the risk of endometrial cancer. The protective effect 
of combination <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">oral contraceptives</a> increases with the length of time they are 
used, and can last for many years after oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contraceptive</a> use has been stopped.
</p>.<p><b>Physical activity</b> </p>.<p>Physical activity may lower the risk of endometrial cancer. </p>.<p><b>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</b> </p>.<p>Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. Being 
pregnant and/or breast-feeding may lower the risk of endometrial cancer. </p>.<p><b>Diet</b> </p>.<p>A diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables may lower the 
risk of endometrial cancer. The risk may also be lowered when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/soy_glycine_soya-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">soy</a> -based foods 
are a regular part of the diet. </p>.<p><b>Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent 
cancer.</b> </p>.<p>Cancer <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of 
developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted 
with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for 
cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer 
and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their 
chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy 
volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. </p>.<p>The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether 
actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and 
vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a>,
