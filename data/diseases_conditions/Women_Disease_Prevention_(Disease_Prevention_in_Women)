<p><b><a name="disease_prevention_in_women_overview" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Screening tests are a basic part of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">preventitive</a> medicine. All screening tests are commonly available through your primary care physician. Some specialized tests may be available only through specialists.

Approximately one in nine women who live to age 65 will develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">breast cancer</a>, although many will not do so until after age 65.</p>.<p>The most important screening methods to detect breast cancer include:</p>.<p>Early detection of breast cancer is important to every woman, regardless of risk factors, because the earlier a cancer is found, the smaller it is likely to be. Studies have clearly shown that the smaller the size of the breast cancer when detected, the better the chance of a surgical cure and long-term survival. Smaller breast cancers are also less likely to have already spread to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lymph nodes</a> and to other organs such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, bones, and brain.</p>.<p>Mammograms can detect many small breast cancers long before they may be felt during breast examinations. There is extensive evidence that early detection by mammography has improved survival in women with this disease.</p>.<p>Some 10% to 15% of breast cancers are not detected through mammograms, but are detected by breast examinations. Therefore a normal mammogram does not completely exclude the possibility of breast cancer, and breast self-examinations and breast examinations by a doctor remain important.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="high_blood_pressure_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>About one-sixth of all Americans have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>, and the incidence of this disease increases with age.

The cells are examined under a microscope in order to look for precancerous (before-cancer) or cancer cells.</p>.<p>Women should have Pap tests as part of an annual pelvic examination beginning at age 21 or three years following the onset of sexual activity. The risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cervical cancer</a> increases sharply during the first few years following the initiation of sexual activity. Some physicians begin screening women as soon as they become sexually active, but not before. High-risk factors for cervical cancer of the cervix include:</p>.<p>In 2009, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) revised its recommendations regarding Pap testing. Instead of beginning at age 18 as previously recommended, the new recommendations advise beginning Pap smears at age 21. Further changes to the ACOG guidelines are:</p>.<p>As it is rare to find a pre-cancerous or cancerous lesion of the cervix in women over the age of 65 who have repeatedly had normal Pap smears, so many doctors stop screening in women over age 65 who have had consistently normal Pap smears. Other doctors decrease the frequency of Pap screening under these circumstances.</p>.<p>Women who have had a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hysterectomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hysterectomy</a> (surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix) do not need Paps unless they have had a cancerous or pre-cancerous lesion of the genital tract. However, they should continue to have manual pelvic and rectal examinations by their doctors as a part of their periodic medical evaluations for reasons other than cancer of the cervix.</p>.<p>There has been a 70% decrease in the death rate from cervical cancer, in large part because of judicious use of the Pap test. Benefits of the Pap test include:</p>.<p>A vaccine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gardasil_vaccine_hpv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Gardasil</a>) has received U.S. FDA approval for use in young women between 9 and 26 years of age. Early vaccination will consistently protect against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 unless the patient has already been infected by one of these viral types. HPV types 16 and 18 are known to be the two viral types most frequently associated with pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. Initial trials with the vaccine have shown that the HPV-16/18 vaccine is safe and induces a high degree of protection against HPV-16/18 infection. Gardasil is given in three injections over a six-month interval. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that girls 11-12 years of age receive the vaccine. It is also recommended for girls and women age 13 through 26 who have not yet been vaccinated or completed the vaccine series.</p>.<p>A newer vaccine (Cervarix) was approved by the FDA in October, 2009, for use in girls and young women ages 10-25 to help prevent cervical cancer. Cervarix targets two HPV <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strains</a>, HPV 16 and HPV 18.

So far, early treatment cannot cure or eradicate the virus. Therefore, early detection is most important to prevent viral spread.</p>.<p>The HIV virus may be present in the blood, genital fluid, and other body secretions of virtually all infected individuals, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. The HIV virus is spread from one person to another when these secretions come in contact with the vagina, anal area, mouth, or eyes, or with a break in the skin, such as from a cut, bruise, sore, or puncture by a needle. Sexual transmission of HIV has been described from men to men, men to women, women to men, and women to women through vaginal, anal, and oral sex.</p>.<p><b><a name="hypercholesterolemia_hyperlipidemia_dyslipidemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Elevated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">LDL cholesterol</a> or low <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HDL cholesterol</a> increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis ("<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_pathology_photo_essay/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hardening of the arteries</a>").
