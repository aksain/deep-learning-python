<p><b><a name="abdominal_migraine_in_children_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_abdominal_migraine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Like adults, children can develop migraines. This can be the same type of 
condition seen in adults, which is typically occurs with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, and is 
sometimes preceded by an aura. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/photophobia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">photophobia</a> (decreased 
tolerance to light) can occur. Children also develop some unusual and atypical 
variations of migraine, not associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> in particular, that are 
not usually observed in adults. Abdominal migraine is one of these variants. </p>.<p>Abdominal migraine is a condition thought to be related to migraine that is 
characterized by pain in the abdomen. It is often precipitated by the usual 
triggers of classic migraine. The pain can be severe, and nausea and vomiting 
can occur. </p>.<p>Abdominal migraine is rare in adults, but it has been estimated that up to 2% 
of all children may develop abdominal migraines. Children who have the condition 
usually go on to develop migraine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> as adults. Girls are affected more 
frequently than boys. Abdominal migraine typically occurs for the first time 
between the ages of 2 and 10.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_abdominal_migraine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of abdominal migraine is poorly understood. Abdominal migraine is 
thought by some researchers to be related to neurologic or endocrinologic 
changes and may be caused by alterations in the levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">serotonin</a> and 
histamine in the body. Genetic factors may also be involved as the condition is 
more common in children who have a family history of migraine. About 60% of 
children with the condition have a positive family history for migraine. </p>.<p>Triggers for abdominal migraine have been described, similar to triggers for 
classic migraine. These include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chocolate_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chocolate</a> or nitrite-containing foods, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_abdominal_migraine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned, abdominal migraine causes pain in the abdomen that can be 
severe and debilitating. It is typically located in the middle portion of the 
belly, often around the umbilicus. Cramping, nausea, and vomiting can accompany 
the pain. Pallor (paleness) of the skin is often observed. There may not be associated 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>. The symptoms are usually relieved by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> and can last anywhere from 
one hour to several days.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_abdominal_migraine_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because of the frequent absence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, the condition can be difficult 
to diagnose, especially during the first episode. There is no specific test that 
can establish the diagnosis of abdominal migraine, so the diagnosis is based on 
exclusion of other conditions. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are usually 
directed to rule out other conditions that could be responsible for the 
symptoms. Electroencephalography (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eeg_-_electroencephalogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">EEG</a>) is sometimes done to rule out a
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizure</a> 
disorder as the cause of the symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_of_abdominal_migraine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of abdominal migraine has two components - to reduce symptoms 
of an acute attack and to prevent or lessen the severity of future episodes. 
Research to date has not provided sufficient data to firmly establish the role 
of any particular medication in either treating symptoms or preventing future 
episodes of abdominal migraine. Still, many patients respond to anti-migraine 
medications and other medications.</p>.<p><b><a name="medications_to_treat_abdominal_migraine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Types of medications that may be used to manage abdominal migraine include:</p>.<p>Other aspects of treatment may include the administration of intravenous 
fluids if vomiting is severe, and the use of sedatives or antiemetic drugs.</p>.<p>Treatment may also include advice to recognize and avoid triggers, if these 
are known. For example, if food triggers have been identified, these should be 
avoided, although not all those who experience abdominal migraine have 
identifiable food triggers. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_management/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Stress management</a> and relaxation programs may be of 
benefit to some.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_abdominal_migraine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for abdominal migraine is good; most children eventually stop 
having the attacks of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>. However, most children (about 70% in one 
study of 54 children) who have abdominal migraine go on to develop migraines in 
adulthood.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
