<p><b><a name="what_is_a_skin_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A skin biopsy is the removal of a piece of skin for the purpose of further examination in the laboratory using a microscope. Skin biopsies are performed to diagnose a number of conditions. Biopsies are not meant to actually treat a skin condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_a_skin_biopsy_performed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Skin biopsy is most frequently done to diagnose a skin growth such as a mole, or a skin condition such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a>.

A skin biopsy may be indicated when a mole or other marking on the skin has changed in its shape, color, or size.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_methods_are_used_to_obtain_a_skin_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different techniques are used in different situations. Typically the biopsies are obtained after using local anesthetics to numb the area to be biopsied.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_to_the_skin_sample_after_the_biopsy_is_removed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After the biopsy, the skin sample is fixed in special solution, and thin sections of the tissue are cut and placed on microscope slides. The slides are stained for examination by a doctor (usually a dermatologist or pathologist). Sometimes specialized stains are used to examine for antibodies, immune proteins, and other markers of certain diseases. Initial routine biopsy results can be obtained in 48 hours or less, while specialized staining techniques can require a longer time until final results are available.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
