This type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.</p>.<p>ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.</p>.<p>In a healthy child, the bone marrow makes blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stem_cells/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stem cells</a> (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.</p>.<p>A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:</p>.<p>A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):</p>.<p>In a child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. The cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are not able to fight infection very well. These cells are cancer (leukemia) cells. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may lead to infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a>, and easy bleeding.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="past_treatment_for_cancer_and_certain_genetic_conditions_affect_the_risk_of_having_childhood_all" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.</p>.<p>Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_of_childhood_all_include_fever_and_bruising" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions.

They are described as:</p>.<p>Other factors that affect the risk group include the following:</p>.<p>It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment. Children with high-risk or very high-risk ALL usually receive more anticancer <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> and/or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.</p>.<p><b><a name="relapsed_childhood_all_is_cancer_that_has_come_back_after_it_has_been_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow, brain, spinal cord, testicles, or other parts of the body.</p>.<p>Refractory childhood ALL is cancer that does not respond to treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_childhood_acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia_all" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatment are available for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p>Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:</p>.<p><b><a name="children_and_adolescents_may_have_treatment-related_side_effects_that_appear_months_or_years_after_treatment_for_acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Regular follow-up exams are very important. Treatment can cause side effects long after it has ended. These are called late effects.</p>.<p>Late effects of cancer treatment may include:</p>.<p>Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.</p>.<p>The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases:</p>.<p>Four types of standard treatment are used:</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.</p>.<p>The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child's risk group. Children with high-risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy.</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles. It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a stem cell transplant.</p>.<p>Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes total-body irradiation, and then replacing the blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor. After the patient receives treatment, the donor's stem cells are given to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the patient's blood cells. The stem cell donor doesn't have to be related to the patient.</p>.<p>Stem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and adolescents with ALL. It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses (comes back after treatment).</p>.<p>Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.</p>.<p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, which causes stem cells to become more white blood cells or blasts than the body needs. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/imatinib-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Imatinib</a> mesylate is a TKI used in the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dasatinib/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dasatinib</a> and ruxolitinib are TKIs that are being studied in the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk ALL.</p>.<p>Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Blinatumomab and inotuzumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of refractory childhood ALL.</p>.<p>New kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_is_given_to_kill_leukemia_cells_that_have_spread_or_may_spread_to_the_brain_spinal_cord_or_testicles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS. Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given.</p>.<p>These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy.</p>.<p>If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="new_types_of_treatment_are_being_tested_in_clinical_trials" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.</p>.<p>CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time.</p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bone_marrow/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Bone marrow aspiration</a> and biopsy is done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_for_childhood_acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of standard-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the remission induction, consolidation/intensification, and maintenance phases always includes combination chemotherapy.
