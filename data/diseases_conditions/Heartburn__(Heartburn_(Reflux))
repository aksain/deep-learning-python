The burning is usually in the central part of the chest, just behind the sternum (breast bone). The burning can worsen or can be brought on by lying flat or on the right side.

To track what foods worsen your symptoms, keep a food journal. In this journal, you should keep track of what you eat, the time you ate, any activity that worsened or made the heartburn better, and indicate which days you have heartburn symptoms. Over time, you will be able to correlate the offending foods with heartburn events. <i>Print this and take this with you to your next doctor's appointment to discuss possible causes of heartburn you may be experiencing.</i></p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="heartburn_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnancy tends to aggravate heartburn because the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is weakened during pregnancy. This weakened (LES) resolves after delivery of the baby. Pregnancy also distorts the organs in the abdomen and the increased abdominal pressure from the growing fetus causes heartburn. These changes promote the reflux of acid and heartburn.</p>.<p>Approximately 17% to 45% of women who become <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> will suffer from heartburn.</p>.<p>Unfortunately there are no clear studies on the safety of heartburn medications on the growing fetus, and researchers are not going to test these <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> on pregnant women to evaluate how safe they are for the developing fetus, so the only option is to test these drugs on pregnant animals. There is no evidence that most of the acid neutralizing or suppressing drugs are harmful to the fetus although nonabsorbable medications are preferred.</p>.<p>Management of heartburn during pregnancy consists of many of the same home remedies and lifestyle changes for a person with heartburn who is not pregnant (see previous section on home remedies and lifestyle changes).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_heartburn" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth to the stomach) has a tight band of muscles at the lower end (lower esophageal sphincter [LES]) that closes after the food enters the stomach and prevents the stomach contents to reenter the esophagus. If this sphincter weakens or relaxes at the wrong time, stomach acid can back up into the esophagus, causing heartburn and its complications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_heartburn_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Often all that a health-care professional requires is a thorough history and physical to make the preliminary diagnosis of heartburn.
