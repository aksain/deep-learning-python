The primary purpose of connective tissue is to hold the body together and provide a framework for growth and development. In Marfan syndrome, the connective tissue is defective and does not act as it should. Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, the syndrome can affect many body systems, including the skeleton, eyes, heart and blood vessels, nervous system, skin, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_this_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Marfan syndrome affects men, women, and children, and has been found among people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Marfan syndrome affects different people in different ways. Some people have only mild symptoms, while others are more severely affected. In most cases, the symptoms progress as the person ages. The body systems most often affected by the syndrome are:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_marfan_syndrome_genetic_or_inherited_causes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect, or mutation, in the gene that determines the structure of fibrillin-1, a protein that is an important part of connective tissue. A person with Marfan syndrome is born with the disorder, even though it may not be diagnosed until later in life.</p>.<p>The defective gene that causes Marfan syndrome can be inherited: The child of a person who has Marfan syndrome has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease. Sometimes a new gene defect occurs during the formation of sperm or egg cells, making it possible for two parents without the disease to have a child with the disease. But this is rare. Two unaffected parents have only a 1 in 10,000 chance of having a child with Marfan syndrome. Possibly 25 percent of cases are due to a spontaneous mutation at the time of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/conception_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conception</a>.</p>.<p>Although everyone with Marfan syndrome has a defect in the same gene, different mutations are found in different families, and not everyone experiences the same characteristics to the same degree. In other words, the defective gene expresses itself in different ways in different people. This phenomena is known as variable expression. Scientists do not yet understand why variable expression occurs in people with Marfan syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_tests_to_diagnose_marfan_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no specific laboratory test, such as a blood test or skin biopsy, to diagnose Marfan syndrome. The doctor and/or geneticist (a doctor with special knowledge about inherited diseases) relies on observation and a complete medical history, including:</p>.<p>The doctor may diagnose Marfan syndrome if the patient has a family history of the disease, and if there are specific problems in at least two of the body systems known to be affected. For a patient with no family history of the disease, at least three body systems must be affected before a diagnosis is made. Moreover, two of the systems must show clear signs that are relatively specific for Marfan syndrome.</p>.<p>In some cases, a genetic analysis may be useful in making a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but such analyses are often time consuming and may not provide any additional helpful information. Family members of a person diagnosed with Marfan syndrome should not assume they are not affected if there is no knowledge that the disorder existed in previous generations of the family. After a clinical diagnosis of a family member, a genetic study might identify the specific mutation for which a test can be performed to determine if other family members are affected.</p>.<p>Recently, doctors discovered a connective tissue disorder known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loeys-dietz_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Loeys-Dietz syndrome</a>, which has several characteristics that overlap with those of Marfan syndrome. When making a diagnosis, it is important to distinguish between the two disorders: Loeys-Dietz is more likely to cause fatal aortic aneurysms, and treatment for the two is different. A diagnostic test for Loeys-Dietz syndrome is available.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_or_other_health_care_professionals_treat_marfan_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because a number of body systems may be affected, a person with Marfan syndrome should be cared for by several different types of doctors. A general practitioner or pediatrician may oversee routine health care and refer the patient to specialists such as a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart disorders), an orthopaedist (a doctor who specializes in bones), or an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specializes in eye disorders), as needed. Some people with Marfan syndrome also go to a geneticist.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_marfan_syndrome_treated_and_can_it_be_cured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no cure for Marfan syndrome. To develop one, scientists may have to identify and change the specific gene responsible for the disorder before birth. However, a range of treatment options can minimize and sometimes prevent complications. The appropriate specialists will develop an individualized treatment program; the approach the doctors use depends on which systems have been affected.</p>.<p><sup>1</sup> All medicines can have side effects. Some medicines and side effects are mentioned in this publication. Some side effects may be more severe than others. You should review the package insert that comes with your medicine and ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have any questions about the possible side effects.</p>.<p>Surgery should be performed before the aorta reaches a size that puts it at high risk for tear or rupture. Because <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> can form around <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">artificial heart</a> valves, people who have a valve replaced must take the blood-thinning drug <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">warfarin</a> for the rest of their lives. They must also take extreme care to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endocarditis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">endocarditis</a> (inflammation of the lining of the heart cavity and valves). Dentists should be alerted to this risk; they are likely to recommend that the patient be prescribed protective medicines before they perform dental work.</p>.<p>Because warfarin carries a risk of some serious side effects, including excessive bleeding, and because it is dangerous to unborn <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a>, doctors are increasingly opting for a newer aortic root replacement procedure that enables people to keep their own valves. The procedure involves removing and replacing the enlarged part of the aorta with a Dacron tube, and resuspending the natural valve into the tube so that the tube supports the valve. The procedure is often performed at an earlier stage than traditional valve replacement. It may also be offered to women with aortic enlargement who are considering <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">becoming pregnant</a>, because it can prevent the rapid aortic growth and possible tearing that sometimes occur during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>.</p>.<p>Pregnancy poses a particular concern due to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a> on the body, particularly the heart. A pregnancy should be undertaken only under conditions specified by obstetricians and other specialists familiar with Marfan syndrome. In some cases, valve surgery prior to pregnancy may be warranted. The pregnancy should be monitored as a high-risk condition. Women with Marfan syndrome may also seek <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_counseling/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genetic counseling</a> concerning the likelihood that they will pass the disease on to their children.</p>.<p>Although eating a balanced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, no vitamin or dietary supplement has been shown to help slow, cure, or prevent Marfan syndrome.</p>.<p>For most people with Marfan syndrome, engaging in moderate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aerobic_exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aerobic exercise</a> is important for promoting skeletal and cardiovascular health and a sense of well-being. However, because of the risk of aortic dissection, people with the syndrome should not engage in contact sports, competitive athletics, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/7_most_effective_exercises_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">isometric exercise</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="living_with_marfan_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Being diagnosed and learning to live with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genetic disorder</a> can cause social, emotional, and financial stress. It often requires a great deal of adjustment in outlook and lifestyle. A person who is an adult when Marfan syndrome is diagnosed may feel angry or afraid. There may also be concerns about passing the disorder to future generations or about its physical, emotional, and financial implications.</p>.<p>The parents and siblings of a child diagnosed with Marfan syndrome may feel sadness, anger, and guilt. It is important for parents to know that nothing that they did caused the fibrillin-1 gene to mutate. Parents may be concerned about the genetic implications for siblings or have questions about the risk to future children.</p>.<p>Some children with Marfan syndrome are advised to restrict their activities. This may require a lifestyle adjustment that is hard for a child to understand or accept.</p>.<p>For both children and adults, appropriate medical care, accurate information, and social support make it easier to live with the disease. Genetic counseling may also be helpful for understanding the disease and its potential impact on future generations.</p>.<p>While Marfan syndrome is a lifelong disorder, the outlook has improved in recent years. As early as the 1970s, the life expectancy of a person with Marfan syndrome was two-thirds that of a person without the disease; however, with improvements in recognition and treatment, people with Marfan syndrome now have a life expectancy similar to that of the average person.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_information_about_clinical_trials_and_research_thats_being_conducted_on_marfan_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Several years ago, National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded researchers found that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/losartan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">losartan</a>, a common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a> medication, also affected a molecular pathway involved in aortic weakening and rupture, an often fatal complication of Marfan syndrome.</p>.<p>Numerous studies are underway that should lead to a better understanding of Marfan syndrome and its treatment. They include a plan to identify the factors responsible for the cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome, a study to better understand the process that leads to skeletal manifestations, and studies to clarify the role of a chemical messenger called transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in the disorder. Some of the most recent studies are identifying new potential therapeutic targets for Marfan syndrome.</p>.<p>Scientists are conducting research on Marfan syndrome from a variety of perspectives. One approach is to better understand what happens once the genetic defect or mutation occurs. How does it change the way connective tissue develops and functions in the body? Why are people with Marfan syndrome affected differently? Scientists are searching for the answers to these questions both by studying the genes themselves and by studying large family groups affected by the disease. Mouse models that carry mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene may help scientists better understand the disorder. Animal studies that can provide preliminary information for gene therapy are also underway.</p>.<p>Other scientists are focusing on ways to treat some of the complications that arise in people with Marfan syndrome. Clinical studies are being conducted to evaluate the usefulness of certain medications in preventing or reducing problems with the aorta.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_people_find_additional_information_about_marfan_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</b><br>Information Clearing House<br>National Institutes of Health<br>1 AMS Circle<br>Bethesda, MD 20892-3675<br>Phone: 301-495-4484 or 877-22-NIAMS (877-226-4267)<br>TTY: 301-565-2966<br>Fax: 301-718-6366<br>E-mail: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d9b7b0b8b4aab0b7bfb699b4b8b0b5f7b7b0b1f7beb6af">[email protected]</a><br>Website: www.niams.nih.gov</p>.<p><b>Other Resources</b></p>.<p><b>National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)</b><br><b>National Institutes of Health</b><br>Website: www.genome.gov</p>.<p><b>NHGRI Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center</b><br>Website: www.genome.gov</p>.<p><b>National Marfan Foundation (NMF)</b><br>Website: www.marfan.org</p>.<p><b>National Organization For Rare Disorders (NORD)</b><br>Website: www.rarediseases.org</p>.<p><b>March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation</b><br>Website: www.marchofdimes.com</p>.<p><b>American Heart Association</b><br>www.americanheart.org</p>.<p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p>.<p>The NIAMS gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the following individuals in the preparation and review of the original version of this booklet: Bernadette Tyree, Ph.D., NIAMS/ NIH; Priscilla Ciccarielo, Director Emeritus, National Marfan Foundation, Port Washington, NY; Harry C.
