<p>Heart failure describes the inability or failure of the heart to adequately meet the needs of organs and tissues for oxygen and nutrients. This decrease in cardiac output, the amount of blood that the heart pumps, is not adequate to circulate the blood returning to the heart from the body and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, causing fluid (mainly water) to leak from capillary blood vessels. This leads to the symptoms that may include shortness of breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, and swelling.</p>.<p>The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs while the left side pumps blood to the rest of the body. Blood from the body enters the <b>right atrium</b> though the vena cava. It then flows into the <b>right ventricle</b> where it is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In the lungs, oxygen is loaded onto <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">red blood cells</a> and returns to the <b>left atrium</b> of the heart via the pulmonary veins. Blood then flows into the <b>left ventricle</b> where it is pumped to the organs and tissues of the body. Oxygen is downloaded from red blood cells into the various organs while carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is added to be removed in the lungs. Blood then returns to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">right atrium</a> to start the cycle again. The pulmonary veins are unusual in that they carry oxygenated blood, while the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood. This is a reversal of duties versus the roles of veins and arteries in the rest of the body.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Left heart</a> failure occurs when the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">left ventricle</a> cannot pump blood to the body and fluid backs up and leaks into the lungs causing shortness of breath. Right heart failure occurs when the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">right ventricle</a> cannot adequately pump blood to the lungs. Blood and fluid may back up in the veins that deliver blood to the heart. This can cause fluid to leak into tissues and organs.</p>.<p>It is important to know that both sides of the heart may fail to function adequately at the same time and this is called biventricular heart failure. This often occurs since the most common cause of right heart failure is left heart failure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Many disease processes can impair the pumping efficiency of the heart to cause congestive heart failure. In the United States, the most common causes of congestive heart failure are:</p>.<p></p>.<p>Less common causes include viral infections of the stiffening of the heart muscle, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thyroid disorders</a>, disorders of the heart rhythm, and many others.</p>.<p>It should also be noted that in patients with underlying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, taking certain medications can lead to the development or worsening of congestive heart failure.

In older patients, not considered transplant candidates, LVAD may be a permanent treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>After congestive heart failure is diagnosed, treatment should be started immediately. Lifestyle modification is one of the most important aspects a patient can incorporate to treat congestive heart failure. Some of these lifestyle changes include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a>, exercise, fluid regulation, and weight maintenance.</p>.<p><b>Sodium: </b>Sodium causes an increase in fluid accumulation in the body's tissues. Because the body is often congested with excess fluid, patients become very sensitive to the levels of intake of sodium and water.<i>Restricting salt and fluid intake</i> is often recommended because of the tendency of fluid to accumulate in the lungs and surrounding tissues.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aerobic_exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Aerobic exercise</a>, once discouraged for congestive heart failure patients, has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining overall functional capacity, quality of life, and perhaps even improving survival. Each person's body has its own unique ability to compensate for the failing heart. Given the same degree of heart muscle weakness, individuals may display widely varying degrees of limitation of function. Regular exercise, when tailored to the person's tolerance level, appears to provide significant benefits and should be used only when the individual is compensated and stable.</p>.<p><b>Addressing potentially reversible factors</b></p>.<p>Depending on the underlying cause of congestive heart failure, potentially reversible factors should be explored. For example:</p>.<p>The total amount of fluid a patient consumes must be regulated. Although many people with congestive heart failure take prescription diuretics to aid in the elimination of excess fluid, the action of these medications can be overwhelmed by an excess intake of water and other fluids. The maxim that "drinking eight glasses of water a day is healthy" certainly does not apply to patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with more advanced cases of congestive heart failure are often advised to limit their total daily fluid intake from all sources to 2 quarts.</p>.<p>The above guidelines for sodium and fluid intake may vary depending on the severity of congestive heart failure in any given individual and should be discussed with their physician.</p>.<p>An important tool for monitoring an appropriate fluid balance is the frequent tracking of the patient's body weight. An early sign of fluid accumulation is an increase in body weight. This may occur even before shortness of breath or swelling in the legs and other body tissues (edema) is detected. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weight gain</a> of 2 to 3 pounds over 2 to 3 days should prompt a call to the physician, who may order an increase in the dose of diuretics or other methods designed to stop the early stages of fluid accumulation before it becomes more severe.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Congestive heart failure is generally a progressive disease with periods of stability punctuated by episodic clinical exacerbations. The course of the disease in any given individual, however, is extremely variable. Factors involved in determining the long term outlook (prognosis) for a given patient include:</p>.<p>With the availability of newer drugs to potentially favorably affect the progression of disease, the prognosis in congestive heart failure is generally more favorable than that observed just 10 years ago. In some cases, especially when the heart muscle dysfunction has recently developed, a significant spontaneous improvement is not uncommonly observed, even to the point where heart function becomes normal.</p>.<p>Heart failure is often graded on a scale of I to IV based on the patient's ability to function.</p>.<p>The prognosis of heart failure patients is very closely associated with the functional class.</p>.<p>An important issue in congestive heart failure is the risk of heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). Of those deaths that occur in individuals with congestive heart failure, approximately 50% are related to progressive heart failure. Importantly, the other half are thought to be related to serious arrhythmias. A major advance has been the finding that nonsurgical placement of automatic implantable <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardioverter</a>/defibrillators (AICD) in individuals with severe congestive heart failure (defined by an ejection fraction below 30% to 35%) can significantly improve survival, and has become the standard of care in most such individuals.</p>.<p>In some people with severe heart failure and certain ECG abnormalities, the left and right side of the heart don't beat in rhythm, and inserting a device called a biventricular pacer can significantly reduce symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Congestive heart failure is the result of an underlying illness, often atherosclerotic heart disease. Controlling those risk factors may help with congestive heart failure prevention. These include lifelong control of high blood pressure, high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking cessation</a>. High blood pressure and diabetes are independent risks for congestive heart failure. Alcohol and drug abuse may be a cause of heart failure.</p>.<p><strong>Diastolic dysfunction:</strong> This is a form of CHF in which the heart muscle may be stiff, most often from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">hypertension</a> or normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a>. The ejection fraction is normal and the prognosis is excellent. The problem is that a stiff heart muscle fills with blood at a higher pressure, which is transmitted to the lungs resulting in shortness of breath. It must be emphasized that the long-term outlook for patients with this condition is excellent.</p>.<p>Resources available for patients trying to cope with the long-term challenges of congestive heart failure include</p>
