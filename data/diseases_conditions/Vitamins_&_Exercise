an amino acid that plays a role in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery disease</a>. It is metabolized (chemically transformed) into methionine and cysteine with the help of the B <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a>; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/folic_acid-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">folic acid</a> 
(B9), B12, and B6 (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pyridoxine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pyridoxine</a>). Therefore, insufficient amounts of these B <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a> in the body can theoretically hamper the metabolic breakdown of homocysteine, and hence increase its blood levels. High levels of homocysteine in the blood (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/homocysteine/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperhomocysteinemia</a>) can damage the inner surface of blood vessels, promote blood clotting, and accelerate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerosis</a>.</p>.<p>The current state of knowledge regarding folic acid, homocysteine, and heart attacks is as follows:</p>.<p>Even though current scientific evidence suggests that taking folic acid and vitamin B <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a> to lower homocysteine levels should help prevent atherosclerosis and heart attacks, conclusive proof is still lacking because:</p>.<p>There is also no official recommendation as to who should be tested for hyperhomocysteinemia. The optimal doses of the B vitamins, folic acid, B12, and B6, required to prevent and treat hyperhomocysteinemia are also uncertain. For folic acid, a daily dose of 0.8-1.0 mg is probably adequate.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_antioxidants_for_heart_attack_prevention" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Antioxidants are food supplements that have been promoted as preventing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>. An important early event in the development of a cholesterol plaque in atherosclerosis is the oxidative modification of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">LDL cholesterol</a> (low density lipoprotein) particles in the blood and the subsequent interaction of this modified LDL with the wall of the coronary artery. This process initiates the formation of the cholesterol plaque.</p>.<p>Antioxidants that block the oxidative modification of LDL have been shown to slow the progression of atherosclerosis in animal experiments. Examples of antioxidants include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_e-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin E</a> and beta carotene. In humans, observational studies (studies that observe the frequency of related conditions) have found a relationship between the dietary intake of vitamin E and lower rates of heart attacks.</p>.<p>Observational studies provide only circumstantial evidence, however, and credible evidence is obtained only by way of controlled trials (discussed at the beginning of this article). Several controlled trials performed to date have yielded conflicting results on the benefits of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat-fighting_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antioxidant</a> therapy. These results may possibly be due to the low doses of vitamin E used, the small number of patients in the study, or the limited duration of treatment.</p>.<p>The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study used a high dose (400 IU per day) of vitamin E over a span of five years in patients with significant risk factors for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>. This study found no difference in the occurrence of heart attack or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> in the group treated with vitamin E versus those given the placebo. This study demonstrated that antioxidant therapy does not have any benefit in persons who have or are at high risk for having atherosclerosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_about_exercise_for_heart_attack_prevention" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Studies of the effects of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> in preventing heart attacks have yielded conflicting results. This is likely due to the fact that people who <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> regularly generally have healthier lifestyles and that many risk factors for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> can be influenced by exercise. Therefore, the specific role of exercise itself in heart attack prevention is difficult to isolate.

While many methods, both chemical and behavioral, have been used to aid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> cessation, the initial success rate is often low, and the relapse rate is high.
