In other cases, people may feel depressed around the winter holidays due to a condition known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), sometimes referred to as seasonal depression. This is a type of depression that tends to occur (and recur) as the days grow shorter in the fall and winter. It is believed that affected people react to the decreasing amounts of sunlight and the colder temperatures as the fall and winter progress, resulting in feelings of depression. Although this disorder usually occurs in the fall and winter, there are those who suffer from this condition during the summer instead of, or in addition to, during the fall or winter. The incidence of seasonal affective disorder increases in people who are living farther away from the equator.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_holiday_depression_anxiety_and_stress" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for depression, anxiety, and stress during the holidays include having a mood disorder or experiencing depression at other times during the year and a lack of adequate social support systems.

Your health-care professional may perform lab tests or other tests to rule out any medical conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Likewise, a full history of your symptoms is likely to provide clues that can help distinguish a mild case of the holiday blues from SAD or a more serious and chronic depressive disorder.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kinds_of_specialists_treat_holiday_depression_anxiety_and_stress" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anxiety, depression, and stress can be treated by a variety of medical and mental-health professionals. Medical doctors, including family medicine physicians and internists, treat holiday depression. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who have special training in treating mental and emotional conditions. There are many other types of mental-health professionals who may treat these conditions. These include psychologists, social workers, mental-health counselors, marital and family therapists, nurse psychotherapists, psychiatric or mental-health nurse practitioners, and others.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_holiday_depression_anxiety_and_stress" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Those suffering from any type of holiday depression or stress may benefit from increased social support during this time of year. For uncomplicated holiday blues, improvement may be found by finding ways to reduce the stresses associated with the holiday, either by limiting commitments and outside activities, making arrangements to share family responsibilities such as gift shopping and meal preparation, agreeing upon financial limits for purchases, or taking extra time to rest and rejuvenate.</p>.<p>Counseling or support groups are another way to relieve some of the burdens of holiday stress or sadness. Knowing that others feel the same way and sharing your thoughts and experiences can help you manage your troubling feelings. Support groups also provide a further layer of social support during this vulnerable time period.</p>.<p>In addition to being an important step in preventing the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder, regular exposure to light that is bright, particularly fluorescent lights, significantly improves depression in people with SAD during the fall and winter. Phototherapy is commercially available in the form of light boxes, which are used for approximately 30 minutes daily. The light required must be of sufficient brightness, approximately 25 times as bright as a normal living room light. The light treatment is used daily in the morning and evening for best results.</p>.<p>Visiting other areas of the world that are characterized by more bright light (such as the Caribbean) can also improve the symptoms of SAD.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Antidepressant</a> medications, particularly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">serotonin</a> selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications, can be an effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder.
