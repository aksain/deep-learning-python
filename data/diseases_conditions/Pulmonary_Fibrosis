<p><b><a name="pulmonary_fibrosis_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>"Fibrosis" is a term used to refer to scarring, so pulmonary fibrosis means scarring throughout the lungs. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The definition of "idiopathic" is "of unknown cause;" thus idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is fibrosis (scarring) of the lungs without a known cause.</p>.<p>IPF mostly affects middle-aged and older adults, and there is no cure. The progress of the disease varies from person to person, but often people diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis live about three to five years following their diagnosis.</p>.<p>
While the cause of IPF is unknown, it is thought that genetics may be a factor. When more than one member of a family has IPF, the disease is referred to as familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many conditions including: </p>.<p>In a condition known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypersensitivity_pneumonitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypersensitivity pneumonitis</a>, fibrosis of the lung can develop following a heightened immune reaction to inhaled organic dusts or occupational chemicals. This condition most often results from inhaling dust contaminated with bacterial, fungal, or animal products. </p>.<p>In some people, chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis develop without an identifiable cause. Most of these people have a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that does not respond to medical therapy, while some of the other types of fibrosis, such as nonspecific <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interstitial_lung_disease_interstitial_pneumonia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">interstitial pneumonitis</a> (NSIP), may respond to immune suppressive therapy. </p>.<p>Synonyms (other names) for various types of pulmonary fibrosis that have been used in the past include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_fibrosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chronic interstitial pneumonitis</a>, Hamman-Rich syndrome, and diffuse fibrosing alveolitis. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_signs_and_symptoms_of_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis include:</p>.<p>Symptoms vary depending on the cause of the pulmonary fibrosis. The severity of symptoms and the progression (worsening) of symptoms over time can vary. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common form, <b>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</b>, has a slow and relentless progression. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_stages_of_idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has been loosely staged and categorized as 
	mild, moderate, or severe, or early versus advanced. The staging is usually 
	based on pulmonary function tests, although these stages are considered 
	arbitrary. </p>.<p>There are some newer proposed staging systems:</p>.<p><b><a name="which_specialties_of_doctors_treat_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have not been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, but have any symptoms of the disease such as shortness of breath, chronic dry cough, diminished exercise tolerance, shallow breathing, chest discomfort, weakness, or other symptoms, see a doctor.</p>.<p>
If you have already been diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or probable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis you should be monitored regularly, and you should referred for evaluation for lung transplantation, even if one is not needed at the immediate time. 
</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_pulmonary_fibrosis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pulmonary fibrosis is suggested by a history of progressive (worsening over time) shortness of breath with exertion. Sometimes, during examination of the lungs with a stethoscope, the doctor can hear crackling sounds in the chest.  These crackles have a very characteristic sound and are very similar to the sound heard when Velcro is pulled apart.  These are often referred to as "<b>Velcro crackles</b> 
(or rales)". The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest X-ray</a> may or may not be abnormal. However, a special X-ray test called a high resolution <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a> will frequently demonstrate abnormalities. This type of X-ray provides a cross-sectional picture of the lungs in very detailed resolution. The classic findings in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis show diffuse peripheral scarring of the lungs with small bubbles (known as bullae) adjacent to the outer lining of the surface of the lung, often at the bases of the lungs. </p>.<p> Lung function testing is distinctly abnormal. The volumes of the lungs may be reduced, as may the airflow, but the characteristic finding is a reduction in the diffusing capacity.  The diffusing capacity is a measure of the ability of the lungs to exchange gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) into and out of the blood stream.</p>.<p>The diagnosis 
of pulmonary fibrosis can be confirmed by lung biopsy. An open surgical biopsy, meaning that the chest wall must be surgically opened under general anesthesia to remove a portion of lung tissue, may be necessary to obtain enough tissue to make an accurate diagnosis.  The most common type of biopsy in this situation is by a <b>video assisted thoracoscope</b>.  
This involves placing a small tube into the chest cavity through which biopsy samples can be obtained.  Often, if the clinical situation is very classical in presentation, a biopsy may be unnecessary.  The biopsy specimen is examined microscopically by a pathologist to confirm the presence of fibrosis. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are very limited. There is no evidence that any medications can help this condition, since scarring is permanent once it has developed. Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available. At times, this diagnosis can be difficult to make even with tissue biopsy reviewed by pathologists with specific experience in this field. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Research trials</a> using different <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> that may reduce fibrous scarring are ongoing. </p>.<p>Two drugs, nintedanib (Ofev) and
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pirfenidone_esbriet/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pirfenidone</a> 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pirfenidone_esbriet/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Esbriet</a>, 
pirfenex, Pirespa) have offered some new hope. The results from two large studies show some slowing of progression of fibrosis, as well as some minor changes to tests of lung function. 
Unfortunately, the side effects from both of these drugs have resulted in some patients being unable to take 
this medication.</p>.<p>Since some types of lung fibrosis can respond to 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corticosteroids</a> (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisone</a>) or other medications that suppress the body's immune system; these types of drugs sometimes 
are prescribed in an attempt to decrease the processes that lead to fibrosis. These drugs do not help idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
However, other causes of lung fibrosis may be responsive to immune suppression.</p>.<p>The immune system is felt to play a central role in the development of many forms of pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of treatment with immune suppressive agents such as corticosteroids is to decrease lung inflammation and subsequent scarring. Responses to treatment are variable. Once scarring has developed, it is permanent. 
Conditions that improve with immune suppressive treatment probably are not idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. </p>.<p>The toxicity and side effects of treatments can be serious. Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis should be followed by a lung specialist experienced in this condition. The lung specialist will determine the need 
and duration of treatment, and will monitor the response to therapy along with any side effects. </p>.<p>Only a minority of patients respond to corticosteroids alone, so other immune-suppressing medications are used in addition to corticosteroids especially if a different cause for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interstitial_lung_disease_interstitial_pneumonia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">interstitial lung disease</a> is suspected. These include:</p>.<p>The anti-inflammatory medication <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colchicine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colchicine</a> has also been used with limited success. Other trials using drugs such as gamma <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interferon/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">interferon</a> 
and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mycophenolate_mofetil-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mycophenolate mofetil</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mycophenolate_mofetil-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cellcept</a>) have not met with much success in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</p>.<p>Pulmonary fibrosis causes decreased oxygen levels in the blood. A decrease in blood oxygen level (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypoxia_and_hypoxemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypoxia</a>) can lead to elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery (the vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs to receive oxygen), a condition known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pulmonary hypertension</a>, which can in turn lead to failure of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">right ventricle</a> of the heart. Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis are frequently treated with supplemental oxygen 
therapy to prevent pulmonary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>. 
</p>.<p>A consensus statement was issued revising the 2011 clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This statement was issued by 
one the largest respiratory physician groups in the world, including members from the United States, Europe, Japan, and Latin America. These recommendations are partially based on a recent study involving the use of prednisone, azathioprine, and 
N-acetylcysteine, so called triple therapy.  In this study, drug recipients had a 10 fold increase in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/grief_bereavement_mourning_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">death rate</a> than the placebo group.   These new guidelines therefore strongly discourage the use of triple therapy in 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These guidelines also suggest that anticoagulation and anti <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">GERD</a> (gastroesophageal reflux disease) not be administered for 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis alone.  These medications should not be used without other medical indications in patients with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Lastly, patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis often have pulmonary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> as their disease progresses. There is currently no indication to use pulmonary hypertensive medication in these patients except oxygen in those with low oxygen levels. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_pulmonary_rehabilitation_for_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation along with medical care helps improve the quality of

vaccination against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">influenza</a> and pneumococcal infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_pulmonary_fibrosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis tends to be relentless in its progression. The complications that occur are a reflection of the failure of the pulmonary system.  
Shortness of breath, decreased activity, and signs of heart 
failure can occur.  As the lungs fail, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> in the lungs rises.  This results in increased work for and ultimately failure of the right side of the heart which pumps the blood through the lungs.  This failure can result in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leg_swelling/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">leg swelling</a>, and overall fluid accumulation in the body.  The immobility and sluggish blood flow can increase the risks for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a>.  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Depression</a> is frequently seen in this devastating disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_pulmonary_fibrosis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has an increased frequency in
