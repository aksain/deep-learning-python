<p><b><a name="rabies_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_rabies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rabies is a viral illness spread via the saliva of an infected animal. This occurs usually through biting a human or another animal. Transmission can also occur through saliva touching an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid_pictures_slideshow_caring_for_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">open wound</a> or touching mucous membranes.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_rabies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The rabies virus causes rabies. The virus infects the brain and ultimately leads to death. After a rabid animal bites someone, the virus is deposited in the muscle and subcutaneous tissue. For most of the incubation period (which is usually one to three months), the virus stays close to the exposure site. The virus then travels via peripheral nerves to the brain and from there, again via peripheral nerves, to nearly all parts of the body.</p>.<p>Any mammal can spread rabies. In the United States, the saliva of rabid bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, and skunks most often transmits rabies. In the developing world, stray <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puppies_and_dogs_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">dogs</a> are the most likely animal to transmit rabies. The virus has also been found in cows, cats, ferrets, and horses.</p>.<p>The local health department will usually have information on which animals in the area have been found to carry the rabies virus.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_rabies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Any activity that brings someone in contact with possible rabid animals, such as traveling in an area where rabies is more common (Africa and Southeast Asia) as well as outdoor activities near bats and other possible rabid animals, all increase one's risk of getting infected with rabies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_rabies_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms can occur as fast as within the first week of the infection.</p>.<p>The early symptoms of rabies are very generalized and include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a>. Without a history of a potential exposure to a rabid animal, these symptoms would not raise the suspicion of rabies as they are very similar to the common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a> or other viral syndromes.</p>.<p>The disease can then take two forms:</p>.<p>Once the clinical signs of rabies occur, the disease is nearly always fatal.</p>.<p>In the U.S., there is one reported case of a patient surviving rabies without vaccination (Jeanna Giese), which led to the development of the so-called Milwaukee treatment protocol. Physicians don't recommend this protocol as a treatment alternative.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_rabies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In animals, health care professionals diagnose rabies by detecting the rabies virus in any affected part of the brain. This requires euthanization of the rabid animal. Testing a suspected animal will help avoid extensive testing in the human contact (if the test is negative) and unnecessary treatments.</p>.<p>In humans, health care professionals diagnose rabies by testing saliva, blood samples, spinal fluid, and skin samples. Multiple tests may be necessary. The tests rely on detection of proteins on the surface of the rabies virus, detection of the genetic material of the virus, or demonstration of an antibody (immune) response to the virus.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_rabies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment is recommended if a health care professional thinks that someone was exposed to a potentially rabid animal.</p>.<p>If the animal is a pet or farm animal that has no symptoms, the animal can be isolated and observed for 10 days. Wild animals that can be captured can be killed and tested for the virus. If the animal can't be found, it is best to consult with the local health department.</p>.<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends prophylaxis (protective treatment) after a wildlife bite from an animal suspected to have rabies.</p>.<p>The general pathway to determine postexposure prophylaxis for rabies requires the following information:</p>.<p>As rabies is a fatal disease, it is often best to start the series of shots until further information is available.</p>.<p>A health care professional administers a series of injections. The first is a rabies immune globulin, human rabies immune globulin (HRIG), which health care professionals only give to previously unvaccinated individuals. It helps to prevent the virus from infecting the individual. Physicians give part of this immunization near and around the animal bite.</p>.<p>Over the next two weeks, health care professionals administer four additional injections. Health care professionals give the first of these as soon as possible after exposure. Doctors give these vaccinations as intramuscular injections, and they help the body fight the virus.</p>.<p>The treatment regimen for previously vaccinated individuals is different, with no HRIG given and only two doses of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_rabies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Once the symptoms of rabies start, the disease is nearly universally fatal.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_rabies_is_there_a_rabies_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rabies prevention is mostly about good pet care and outdoor behavior. Vaccinate pets and keep them away from wild and outdoor animals. Don't approach wild animals. Keep bats out of the home, and stay away from areas with bats (caves).</p>.<p>When traveling, be aware of stray animals.</p>.<p>If spending significant time in a country where rabies is common, one should consider vaccination.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
