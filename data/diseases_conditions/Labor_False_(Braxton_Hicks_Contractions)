They are perfectly normal and have been said to represent contractions that occur as the uterus is preparing to give birth. In some women, they occur as early as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/second_trimester_16_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">second trimester</a>. Sometimes, Braxton-Hicks contractions have been referred to as "false labor."</p>.<p>In contrast to the contractions of true labor, Braxton-Hicks contractions do not occur at regular intervals, do not get stronger over time, and do not last longer over time. They do not occur at predictable intervals, and they may disappear altogether for a time. They tend to become more frequent toward the end of pregnancy.</p>.<p>Common events can sometimes trigger Braxton-Hicks contractions, such as increased activity of mother or baby, touching of the maternal abdomen, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a>, sexual intercourse, or a distended maternal bladder.</p>.<p>Braxton-Hicks contractions are named after an English doctor, John Braxton Hicks, who described them in 1872.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_braxton_hicks_contractions_feel_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Braxton-Hicks contractions are not typically as painful as those of true labor contractions may be. Some women describe them as a tightening sensation across the lower abdomen. They may feel similar to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstrual cramps</a> in some women. The abdomen may become firm to the touch. They do not occur at regular intervals.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_if_braxton_hicks_contractions_are_uncomfortable" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are measures that can be taken to bring about relief if Braxton-Hicks contractions are uncomfortable:</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_my_doctor_about_braxton_hicks_contractions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Call your doctor or midwife if you haven't reached 37 weeks and the contractions are increasing in frequency, are more painful or you have any of the signs of preterm labor:</p>
