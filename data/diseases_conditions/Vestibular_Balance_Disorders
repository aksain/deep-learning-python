<p><b><a name="what_is_a_balance_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady or 
	dizzy, 
	as if you are moving, spinning, or floating, even though you are standing 
	still or lying down. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/balance_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Balance disorders</a> can be caused by certain health 
	conditions, medications, or a problem in the inner ear or the brain.</p>.<p>Our sense of balance is primarily controlled by a maze-like structure in 
	our inner ear called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/ear_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">labyrinth</a>, which is made of bone and soft tissue. 
	At one end of the labyrinth is an intricate system of loops and pouches 
	called the semicircular canals and the otolithic organs, which help us 
	maintain our balance. At the other end is a snail-shaped organ called the 
	cochlea, which enables us to hear. The medical term for all of the parts of 
	the inner ear involved with balance is the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/balance_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vestibular system</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_the_vestibular_system_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Our <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/balance_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vestibular</a> system works with other sensorimotor systems in the body, 
	such as our visual system (eyes) and skeletal system (bones and joints), to 
	check and maintain the position of our body at rest or in motion. It also 
	helps us maintain a steady focus on objects even though the position of our 
	body changes. The vestibular system does this by detecting mechanical 
	forces, including gravity, that act upon our vestibular organs when we move. 
	Two sections of the labyrinth help us accomplish these tasks: the 
	semicircular canals and the otolithic organs.</p>.<p>The semicircular canals are three fluid-filled loops arranged roughly at 
	right angles to each other. They tell the brain when our head moves in a 
	rotating or circular way, such as when we nod our head up and down or look 
	from right to left.</p>.<p>Each semicircular canal has a plump base, which contains a 
	raindrop-shaped structure filled with a gel-like substance. 
	This structure, called the cupula, sits on top of a cluster of sensory 
	cells, called hair cells. The hair cells have long threadlike extensions, 
	called stereocilia, that extend into the gel. When the head moves, fluid 
	inside the semicircular canal moves. This motion causes the cupula to bend 
	and the stereocilia within it to tilt to one side. The tilting action 
	creates a signal that travels to the brain to tell it the movement and 
	position of your head.</p>.<p>Between the semicircular canals and the cochlea lie the otolithic organs, 
	which are two fluid-filled pouches called the utricle and the saccule. These 
	organs tell the brain when our body is moving in a straight line, such as 
	when we stand up or ride in a car or on a bike. They also tell the brain the 
	position of our head with respect to gravity, such as whether we are sitting 
	up, leaning back, or lying down.</p>.<p>Like the semicircular canals, the utricle and the saccule have sensory 
	hair cells. These hair cells line the bottom of each pouch, and their 
	stereocilia extend into an overlying gel-like layer. On top of the gel are 
	tiny grains made of 
	<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcium_carbonate/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">calcium carbonate</a> called otoconia. When you tilt your 
	head, gravity pulls on the grains, which then move the stereocilia. As with 
	the semicircular canals, this movement creates a signal that tells the brain 
	the head's position.</p>.<p>Our visual system works with our vestibular system to keep objects from 
	blurring when our head moves and to keep us aware of our position when we 
	walk or when we ride in a vehicle. Sensory receptors in our joints and 
	muscles also help us maintain our balance when we stand still or walk. The 
	brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from these systems 
	to control our balance.</p>.<p><b>Figure 1.</b> Diagram of outer, middle, and inner ear. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/ear_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">outer ear</a> is labeled
in the figure and includes the ear canal. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">middle ear</a> includes the eardrum
(tympanic membrane) and three tiny bones for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a>. The bones are called the
hammer (malleus), anvil (incus), and stirrup (stapes) to reflect their shapes.
The middle ear connects to the back of the throat by the Eustachian tube. The
inner ear (labyrinth) contains the semicircular canals and vestibule for
balance, and the cochlea for hearing.</p>.<p>The vestibular structures of the inner ear are the vestibule (which is made
up of the utricle and saccule) and the three semicircular canals. These
structures work somewhat like a carpenter's level (a tool used to show how "level"
a horizontal or vertical surface is). That is, they work by way of the
vestibulocochlear nerve with the vestibular center in the brain to deal with
body balance and position. (The rest of the inner ear, that is, the cochlea, is
concerned with hearing.) Thus, the vestibular <i> system</i> includes the vestibule, the
semicircular canals, the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve, and
the vestibular center in the brain.</p>.<p>The vestibular system measures linear and rotational movement. A number of
disorders can cause this system to stop working or provide inappropriate
information. These disorders include

	short time periods or last for longer periods of time.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_balance_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A balance disorder may be caused by viral or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bacterial infections</a> in the 
	ear, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">head injury</a>, or blood circulation disorders that affect the inner ear 
	or brain. Many people experience problems with their sense of balance as 
	they get older. Balance problems and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a> also can result from taking 
	certain medications.</p>.<p>In addition, problems in the visual and skeletal systems and the nervous 
	and circulatory systems can be the source of some posture and balance 
	problems. A circulatory system disorder, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low blood pressure</a>, can 
	lead to a feeling of dizziness when we suddenly stand up. Problems in the 
	skeletal or visual systems, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arthritis</a> or eye muscle imbalance, also 
	may cause balance problems. However, many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vertigo_balance_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">balance disorders</a> can begin all of 
	a sudden and with no obvious cause.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_types_of_balance_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are more than a dozen different balance disorders. Some of the most 
	common are:</p>.<p><b>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)</b> or positional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vertigo_balance_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vertigo</a> is a 
	brief, intense episode of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vertigo/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vertigo</a> that occurs because of a specific change 
	in the position of the head. If you have BPPV, you might feel as if you're 
	spinning when you look for an object on a high or low shelf or turn your 
	head to look over your shoulder (such as when you back up your car). You 
	also may experience BPPV when you roll over in bed. BPPV is caused when 
	otoconia tumble from the utricle into one of the semicircular canals and 
	weigh on the cupula. The cupula can't tilt properly and sends conflicting 
	messages to the brain about the position of the head, causing vertigo. BPPV 
	sometimes may result from a head injury or just from getting older.</p>.<p><b>Labyrinthitis</b> is an infection or inflammation of the inner ear that 
	causes dizziness and loss of balance. It frequently is associated with an 
	upper respiratory infection such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu</a>.</p>.<p><b>Ménière's disease</b> is associated with a change in fluid volume within 
	parts of the labyrinth. Ménière's disease causes episodes of vertigo, 
	irregular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing loss</a>,
	<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_in_the_ears/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tinnitus</a> (a 
	ringing or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_in_the_ears/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">buzzing in the ear</a>), and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The 
	cause of this disease is unknown.</p>.<p><b>Vestibular neuronitis</b> is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve and may 
	be caused by a virus. Its primary symptom is vertigo.</p>.<p><b>Perilymph fistula</b> is a leakage of inner ear fluid into the middle ear. It 
	can occur after a head injury, drastic changes in atmospheric pressure (such 
	as when scuba diving), physical exertion, ear surgery, or 
	chronic ear 
	infections. Its most notable symptom, besides dizziness and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, is 
	unsteadiness when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a> or standing that increases with activity and 
	decreases with rest. Some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a> may be born with perilymph fistula, usually 
	in association with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hearing_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing loss</a> that is present at birth.</p>.<p><b>Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS)</b> is a balance disorder in which you 
	feel as if you're continuously rocking or bobbing. It generally happens 
	after an ocean cruise or other sea travel. Usually, the symptoms will go 
	away in a matter of hours or days after you reach land. However, severe 
	cases can last months or even years.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_balance_disorder_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diagnosis of a balance disorder is difficult. There are many potential 
	causes - including medical conditions and medications.</p>.<p>To help evaluate a balance problem, your doctor may suggest you see an 
	otolaryngologist. An otolaryngologist is a physician and surgeon who 
	specializes in the ear, nose, and throat. An otolaryngologist may request 
	tests to assess the cause and extent of the balance problem depending on 
	your symptoms and health status.</p>.<p>The otolaryngologist may request a hearing examination, blood tests, an 
	electronystagmogram (which measures eye movements and the muscles that 
	control them), or imaging studies of your head and brain. Another possible 
	test is called posturography. For this test, you stand on a special movable 
	platform in front of a patterned screen. The doctor measures how your body 
	moves in response to movement of the platform, the patterned screen, or 
	both.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_balance_disorder_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first thing a doctor will do to treat a balance disorder is determine 
	if your dizziness is caused by a medical condition or medication. If it is, 
	your doctor will treat the condition or suggest a different medication.</p>.<p>Your doctor also may describe ways for you to handle daily activities 
	that increase the risk of falling and injury, such as driving, walking up or 
	down stairs, and using the bathroom. If you have BPPV, your doctor might 
	prescribe a series of simple movements, called the Epley maneuver, to help 
	dislodge the otoconia from the semicircular canal. You begin the Epley 
	maneuver by sitting upright, with the help of a trained therapist, then 
	quickly lie down on your back, turn your head to one side, and wait for a 
	minute or two before sitting back up again (see Figure 3). For some people, 
	one session will be all that is needed. Others might need to repeat the 
	procedure several times at home to relieve their dizziness.</p>.<p>If you are diagnosed with Ménière's disease, your doctor may recommend 
	changes in your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, such as reducing the use of salt in your food and 
	limiting alcohol and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a>. Not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> also may help. Some anti-vertigo 
	or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antiemetics/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anti-nausea</a> medications may relieve your symptoms, but they can also make 
	you drowsy. Other medications, such as the antibiotic gentamicin or 
	<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corticosteroids</a>, may be injected behind the eardrum to reach the inner ear. 
	Although gentamicin helps reduce dizziness, it occasionally destroys sensory 
	cells in the cochlea and causes permanent hearing loss. The risk of hearing 
	loss can be lowered if small doses of gentamicin are given off and on until 
	your symptoms decrease. Corticosteroids don't cause hearing loss; however, 
	research is underway to determine if they are as effective as gentamicin. 
	Surgery on the vestibular organ may be necessary if you have a severe case 
	of Ménière's disease.</p>.<p>Some people with a balance disorder may not be able to fully relieve 
	their dizziness and will have to develop ways to cope with it on a daily 
	basis. A vestibular rehabilitation therapist can help by developing an 
	individualized treatment plan that combines head, body, and eye exercises to 
	decrease dizziness and nausea.</p>.<p>To reduce your risk of injury from dizziness, avoid walking in the dark. 
	You also should wear low-heeled shoes or walking shoes outdoors and use a 
	cane or walker if necessary. If you have handrails in the home, inspect them 
	periodically to make sure they are safe and secure. Modifications to 
	bathroom fixtures can make them safer. Conditions at work may need to be 
	modified or restricted, at least temporarily. Driving a car may be 
	especially hazardous. Ask your doctor's opinion about whether it's safe for 
	you to drive.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_know_if_i_have_a_balance_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Everyone has a dizzy spell now and then, but the term “dizziness” may 
	mean something different to different people. For some people, dizziness 
	might be a fleeting sensation of spinning, while for others it's intense and 
	lasts a long time. Experts believe that more than four out of 10 Americans 
	will experience an episode of dizziness significant enough to send them to a 
	doctor.</p>.<p>To help you decide whether or not you should seek medical help for a 
	dizzy spell, ask yourself the following questions. If you answer “yes” to

	problem—displaced otoconia—is located deep within the ear, doctors have had 
	to rely mainly on observation and a medical history to make a diagnosis. 
	Researchers supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other 
	Communication Disorders (NIDCD) now have created a head-mounted apparatus 
	that uses 3-D animation to map the location of otoconia in the inner ear. 
	The apparatus is built around a pair of infrared video goggles that gather 
	data from eye and head movements and then sends it to a computer program for 
	mapping. A second computer program uses the data to develop a step-by-step 
	guide for repositioning maneuvers to dislodge the otoconia from the 
	semicircular canals. If shown to be effective in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">clinical trials</a>, the 
	apparatus and its software programs will help doctors more accurately 
	diagnose BPPV and guide repositioning maneuvers to ensure the best possible 
	treatment. </p>.<p>Other NIDCD-supported scientists are looking at the molecular mechanisms 
	that regulate the development of the inner ear. One research team has 
	identified a gene that encodes a protein that helps in the formation of the 
	semicircular canals and their related sensory tissue. Another team has 
	identified a family of genes, called the otopetrins, which help form 
	otoconia in mice. Findings from the mouse study could help researchers 
	determine if otoconia destroyed by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a>, medications, infections, or trauma 
	can someday be regenerated in humans with balance problems.</p>.<p>NIDCD-supported scientists also are experimenting with several types of 
	vestibular prostheses, or replacement parts, in balance-impaired animals. 
	Researchers hope these devices will one day be used to compensate for 
	vestibular system loss in people.</p>.<p>One prosthesis uses a head-mounted motion sensor to mimic the ear and 
	brain's natural signaling system. The sensor measures the head's rotation 
	and sends the information to a microprocessor. The microprocessor then 
	converts the signals into electrical impulses and sends them to an electrode 
	implanted in the ear. The electrode stimulates the vestibular nerve, 
	creating a signal that helps the brain move the eyes to compensate for the 
	head's rotation.</p>.<p>A second prosthesis is designed to simulate the movement of fluid within 
	the semicircular canal. In a normal ear, fluid changes help the brain 
	understand the movement and position of the head. The device combines 
	microcontroller circuitry with a tiny mechanical device that increases 
	normal fluid movement to provide a stronger vestibular signal to the brain.</p>.<p>Researchers also are studying the effectiveness of different types of 
	rehabilitative exercises as a treatment option for balance disorders. In one 
	NIDCD-funded study, researchers have used virtual reality technology to 
	simulate the aisles of a grocery store. Using a real cart attached to a 
	custom-built treadmill in front of a projection screen, patients “walk” down 
	aisles, scanning virtual store shelves for items on their list. Researchers 
	are testing whether practicing in the virtual store will lessen episodes of 
	dizziness in the real world, especially in visually complex environments.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
