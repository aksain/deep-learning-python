<p><b><a name="toxoplasmosis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_toxoplasmosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite called <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. The infection is most commonly acquired from contact with cats and their feces or with raw or undercooked meat.</p>.<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prevention</a> (CDC) estimates that more than 60 million people in the United States may carry the <i>Toxoplasma</i> parasite, but very few have symptoms because a healthy immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_cause_of_toxoplasmosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are only a few ways to acquire the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_factors_increase_the_risk_of_acquiring_toxo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following situations potentially expose a person to the <i>Toxoplasma</i> parasite and increase the risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis:</p>.<p>If a woman is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> when she is infected with toxo, the infection can be transmitted to the baby with sometimes catastrophic consequences.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_usual_symptoms_of_toxoplasmosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although people infected with toxoplasmosis are often unaware of having this disease, typical symptoms of toxo are flulike symptoms, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swollen lymph nodes</a> and muscle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aches</a> and pains that last from a few days to several weeks.  If your immune system is normal, you cannot get the infection again.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_do_some_people_develop_severe_problems_from_toxo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Few people with toxo develop symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, anyone with a compromised immune system is at risk for serious problems from toxo. These individuals include those undergoing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a>, people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV/AIDS</a> or other immune disorders, and recent organ-transplant recipients.</p>.<p>In these people, an infection that occurred anytime during life can reactivate and cause the severe symptoms of toxoplasmosis such as damage to the eye, brain, or other organs.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ocular</a> toxoplasmosis, which damages the eyes, can lead to reduced vision, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blurred_vision/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blurred vision</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> (often with bright light), redness of the eye, and sometimes tearing, according to the CDC.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_toxoplasmosis_develop_into_a_more_serious_illness_in_babies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, the immune system in infants is not fully mature until after birth.  Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs when a fetus is infected.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a> of women who were exposed to toxo within a few months of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">becoming pregnant</a> or during pregnancy are at an increased risk for developing a severe case of toxo. Pregnant women who newly contract the toxoplasmosis parasite have a 20% chance of transmitting it to their unborn child, according to the Organization of Teratology Specialists. When the mother is infected in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">first trimester</a>, there is a 10%-15% chance of passing the parasite on to her child. In the U.S., it is estimated that up to 4,000 babies are born with toxoplasmosis annually.  Women who were first exposed to toxo more than six months before becoming pregnant are not likely to pass the infection to their children.</p>.<p> Most newborns have no symptoms, but a small percentage may be born with congenital eye or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain damage</a>. Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms of the disease often appear a few months after birth.</p>.<p>Some signs of toxoplasmosis may be present at birth, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">jaundice</a>, skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a>, and enlarged <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_meant_by_a_baby_developing_a_more_severe_case_of_toxo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children born with toxoplasmosis can be afflicted with intellectual 
disabilities, convulsions, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spasticity/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">spasticity</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cerebral_palsy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cerebral palsy</a>, deafness, and severely impaired vision. The infant's head may be abnormally small (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/microcephaly/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">microcephaly</a>) or abnormally large due to increased pressure on the brain (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocephalus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hydrocephalus</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_toxo_diagnosed_in_the_lab" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A toxoplasmosis blood test checks for the presence of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in the blood. The results can determine if the patient has had toxo and whether the infection is recent ("acute") or not.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_toxoplasmosis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since toxo usually causes mild to no symptoms, and a healthy immune system prevents any remaining parasites in the body from causing further symptoms, most people don't need to worry about getting this disease. Currently there is no vaccine for toxoplasmosis in humans.</p>.<p>However, if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, there are several steps you should take to prevent exposure to toxoplasmosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="am_i_able_to_keep_my_cat" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, but if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, there are some steps to take to avoid being exposed to toxo, according to the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine.</p>.<p>Most importantly, you can help prevent your cats from getting infected with toxo. Feed them dry or canned cat food and keep them indoors. Cats can become infected by eating or being fed raw or undercooked meat that is infected with the parasite, or by eating infected prey such as birds or rodents. Any cat that is allowed access to outdoors should be kept off beds, pillows, or other furniture that you also use. Don't bring a new cat into your house that might have been an outdoor cat or might have been fed raw meat. Avoid handling stray cats and kittens. Have your cat tested for the parasite. Your vet can answer any other questions you may have regarding your cat and the risk for toxoplasmosis.</p>.<p>Have someone who is healthy and not pregnant change your cat's litter box. If this is not possible, wear gloves and clean the litter box daily (the parasite found in cat feces needs a few days after being passed to become infectious). Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward.</p>.<p><b><a name="once_infected_with_toxo_is_my_cat_always_able_to_spread_the_infection_to_me" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No, cats can only spread toxo in their feces for a few weeks after they are first infected with the parasite. Like humans, cats rarely have symptoms when first infected, so most people don't know if their cat has been exposed to toxo. Most infected cats appear healthy.  There are no good tests available to determine if your cat is passing toxo in its feces.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_toxoplasmosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Once the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is confirmed, you and your doctor should discuss whether treatment is necessary. In an otherwise healthy person who is not pregnant, treatment is not needed. Symptoms will usually go away within a few weeks. For pregnant women or people who have weakened immune systems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> are available to treat the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_toxoplasmosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of people who get toxoplasmosis will have no significant long-term effects.</p>.<p>An infected fetus or infant has a variable prognosis, depending on the severity of the effects of the disease. The earlier the fetus is infected, the worse the prognosis. A woman carrying a severely affected fetus may experience a spontaneous abortion (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">miscarriage</a>), and newborns may develop significant physical or mental problems.</p>.<p>Patients with compromised immune systems have a variable prognosis, depending on their response to treatment. Patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a> or long-term immune compromised states will need to continue treatment for life. <span id="cntid"></span></p>
