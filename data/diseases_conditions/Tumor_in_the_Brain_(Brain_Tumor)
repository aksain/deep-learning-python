Davis, MD, PhD</a></p>.<p>Reference: Lo, BM. "Brain Neoplasms." Medscape. Updated Nov 09, 2015.<br>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/779664-overview</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_parts_of_the_brain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The brain is a soft, spongy mass of <i>tissue</i>. It is protected by:</p>.<p>The brain directs the things we choose to do (like walking and talking) and the things our body does without thinking (like breathing). The brain is also in charge of our senses (sight, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing</a>, touch, taste, and smell), memory, emotions, and personality.</p>.<p>A network of nerves carries messages back and forth between the brain and the rest of the body. Some nerves go directly from the brain to the eyes, ears, and other parts of the head. Other nerves run through the spinal cord to connect the brain with the other parts of the body.</p>.<p>Within the brain and spinal cord, glial cells surround nerve cells and hold them in place.</p>.<p>The three major parts of the brain control different activities:</p>.<p>The cerebrum is divided into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The right hemisphere controls the muscles on the left side of the body. The left hemisphere controls the muscles on the right side of the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="brain_tumor_types" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When most normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor.</p>.<p>Primary brain tumors can be benign or malignant:</p>.<p><b>Benign brain tumors</b> do not contain cancer cells:</p>.<p><b>Malignant brain tumors </b>(also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">brain cancer</a>) contain cancer cells:</p>.<p><b><a name="types_of_primary_brain_tumors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many types of primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin. For example, most primary brain tumors begin in glial cells. This type of tumor is called a glioma.</p>.<p>Among adults, the most common types are:</p>.<p>Among children, the most common types are:</p>.<p><b><a name="brain_tumor_grades" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors group brain tumors by grade. The grade of a tumor refers to the way the cells look under a microscope:</p>.<p>Cells from low-grade tumors (grades I and II) look more normal and generally grow more slowly than cells from high-grade tumors (grades III and IV).</p>.<p>Over time, a low-grade tumor may become a high-grade tumor. However, the change to a high-grade tumor happens more often among adults than children.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_and_risk_factors_for_brain_tumors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When you're told that you have a brain tumor, it's natural to wonder what may have caused your disease. But no one knows the exact causes of brain tumors. Doctors seldom know why one person develops a brain tumor and another doesn't.</p>.<p>Researchers are studying whether people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.</p>.<p>Studies have found the following risk factors for brain tumors:</p>.<p>Researchers are studying whether using cell phones, having had a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">head injury</a>, or having been exposed to certain chemicals at work or to magnetic fields are important risk factors. Studies have not shown consistent links between these possible risk factors and brain tumors, but additional research is needed.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_brain_tumor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of a brain tumor depend on tumor size, type, and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or harms a part of the brain. Also, they may be caused when a tumor blocks the fluid that flows through and around the brain, or when the brain swells because of the buildup of fluid.</p>.<p>These are the most common symptoms of brain tumors:</p>.<p>Most often, these symptoms are not due to a brain tumor. Another health problem could cause them. If you have any of these symptoms, you should tell your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_brain_tumors_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have symptoms that suggest a brain tumor, your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your personal and family health history. You may have one or more of the following tests:</p>.<p>However, if the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove tissue from the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. In this case, the doctor uses MRI, CT, or other imaging tests to learn as much as possible about the brain tumor.</p>.<p>A person who needs a biopsy may want to ask the doctor the following questions:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_a_second_opinion_for_brain_tumor_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about your diagnosis and treatment plan. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.</p>.<p>If you get a second opinion, the doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you'll have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at your options.</p>.<p>It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In many cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually won't make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor. Some people with a brain tumor need treatment right away.</p>.<p>There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.</p>.<p>Also, you can request a consultation with specialists at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_brain_tumor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with brain tumors have several treatment options. The options are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Many people get a combination of treatments.</p>.<p>The choice of treatment depends mainly on the following:</p>.<p>For some types of brain cancer, the doctor also needs to know whether cancer cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>.<p>Your doctor can describe your treatment choices, the expected results, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your medical and personal needs.</p>.<p>You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. See the Taking Part in Cancer Research section.</p>.<p>Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat brain tumors include neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neuroradiologists.</p>.<p>Your health care team may also include an oncology nurse, a registered dietitian, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mental health</a> counselor, a social worker, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, and a physical medicine specialist. Also, children may need tutors to help with schoolwork. (The Rehabilitation section has more information about therapists and tutors.)</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions before you begin treatment:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_type_of_surgery_is_available_for_brain_tumors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery is the usual first treatment for most brain tumors. Before surgery begins, you may be given general anesthesia, and your scalp is shaved. You probably won't need your entire head shaved.</p>.<p>Surgery to open the skull is called a craniotomy. The surgeon makes an incision in your scalp and uses a special type of saw to remove a piece of bone from the skull.</p>.<p>You may be awake when the surgeon removes part or all of the brain tumor. The surgeon removes as much tumor as possible. You may be asked to move a leg, count, say the alphabet, or tell a story. Your ability to follow these commands helps the surgeon protect important parts of the brain.</p>.<p>After the tumor is removed, the surgeon covers the opening in the skull with the piece of bone or with a piece of metal or fabric. The surgeon then closes the incision in the scalp.</p>.<p>Sometimes surgery isn't possible. If the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. People who can't have surgery may receive radiation therapy or other treatment.</p>.<p>You may have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headache</a> or be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> relief with your health care team. After surgery, your team can adjust the plan if you need more relief.</p>.<p>You may also feel tired or weak. The time it takes to heal after surgery is different for everyone. You will probably spend a few days in the hospital.</p>.<p>Other, less common problems may occur after surgery for a brain tumor. The brain may swell or fluid may build up within the skull. The health care team will monitor you for signs of swelling or fluid buildup. You may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. A second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. The surgeon may place a long, thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. (For some people, the shunt is placed before performing surgery on the brain tumor.) The tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. Excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. Sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead.</p>.<p>Infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. If this happens, the health care team will give you an antibiotic.</p>.<p>Brain surgery may harm normal tissue. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Brain damage</a> can be a serious problem. It can cause problems with thinking, seeing, or speaking. It can also cause personality changes or seizures. Most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. But sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. You may need physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. See the Rehabilitation section.</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions about surgery:</p>.<p><b><a name="radiation_therapy_for_brain_tumors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Radiation therapy kills brain tumor cells with high-energy x-rays, gamma rays, or protons.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy usually follows surgery. The radiation kills tumor cells that may remain in the area. Sometimes, people who can't have surgery have radiation therapy instead.</p>.<p>Doctors use external and internal types of radiation therapy to treat brain tumors:</p>.<p>Some people have no or few side effects after treatment. Rarely, people may have nausea for several hours after external radiation therapy. The health care team can suggest ways to help you cope with this problem. Radiation therapy also may cause you to become very tired with each radiation treatment. Resting is important, but doctors usually advise people to try to stay as active as they can.</p>.<p>Also, external radiation therapy commonly causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hair loss</a> from the part of the head that was treated. Hair usually grows back within a few months. Radiation therapy also may make the skin on the scalp and ears red, dry, and tender. The health care team can suggest ways to relieve these problems.</p>.<p>Sometimes radiation therapy causes brain tissue to swell. You may get a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">headache</a> or feel pressure. The health care team watches for signs of this problem. They can provide medicine to reduce the discomfort. Radiation sometimes kills healthy brain tissue. Although rare, this side effect can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">headaches</a>, seizures, or even death.</p>.<p>Radiation may harm the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pituitary_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pituitary gland</a> and other areas of the brain. For children, this damage could cause learning problems or slow down growth and development. In addition, radiation increases the risk of secondary tumors later in life.</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions about radiation therapy:</p>.<p><b><a name="chemotherapy_for_brain_tumors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chemotherapy, the use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to kill cancer cells, is sometimes used to treat brain tumors. Drugs may be given in the following ways:</p>.<p>You may want to ask your doctor these questions about chemotherapy:</p>.<p><b><a name="nutrition_during_brain_tumor_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's important for you to take care of yourself by eating well. You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.</p>.<p>Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a>) can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to deal with these problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_supportive_care_is_available_for_patients_and_caregivers" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A brain tumor and its treatment can lead to other health problems. You may receive supportive care to prevent or control these problems.</p>.<p>You can have supportive care before, during, and after cancer treatment. It can improve your comfort and quality of life during treatment.</p>.<p>Your health care team can help you with the following problems:</p>.<p>Many people with brain tumors receive supportive care along with treatments intended to slow the progress of the disease. Some decide not to have antitumor treatment and receive only supportive care to manage their symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_rehabilitation_after_brain_tumor_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rehabilitation can be a very important part of the treatment plan. The goals of rehabilitation depend on your needs and how the tumor has affected your ability to carry out daily activities.</p>.<p>Some people may never regain all the abilities they had before the brain tumor and its treatment. But your health care team makes every effort to help you return to normal activities as soon as possible.</p>.<p>Several types of therapists can help:</p>.<p>Children with brain tumors may have special needs. Sometimes children have tutors in the hospital or at home. Children who have problems learning or remembering what they learn may need tutors or special classes when they return to school.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_follow-up_care_after_brain_tumor_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You'll need regular checkups after treatment for a brain tumor. For example, for certain types of brain tumors, checkups may be every 3 months. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems between checkups, you should contact your doctor.</p>.<p>Your doctor will check for return of the tumor. Also, checkups help detect health problems that can result from cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Checkups may include careful physical and neurologic exams, as well as MRI or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scans</a>. If you have a shunt, your doctor checks to see that it's working well.</p>.<p>The NCI has publications to help answer questions about follow-up care and other concerns. You may find it helpful to read the NCI article Facing Forward: Life After Cancer Treatment. You may also want to read the NCI article Follow-up Care After Cancer Treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="sources_of_support" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Learning you have a brain tumor can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that such a diagnosis can bring.</p>.<p>Concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills are common. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities.</p>.<p>Here's where you can go for support:</p>.<p>For tips on coping, you may want to read the NCI booklet Taking Time: Support for People With Cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="taking_part_in_cancer_research" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer research has led to real progress in the detection and treatment of brain tumors. Continuing research offers hope that in the future even more people with brain tumors will be treated successfully.</p>.<p>Doctors all over the country are conducting many types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a> (research studies in which people volunteer to take part). Clinical trials are designed to find out whether new approaches are safe and effective.</p>.<p>Doctors are trying to find better ways to care for adults and children with brain tumors. They are testing new drugs and combining drugs with radiation therapy. They are also studying how drugs may reduce the side effects of treatment.</p>.<p>Even if the people in a trial do not benefit directly, they may still make an important contribution by helping doctors learn more about brain tumors and how to control them. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, doctors do all they can to protect their patients.</p>.<p>If you're interested in being part of a clinical trial, talk with your doctor. You may want to read the NCI booklet Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies. It describes how treatment studies are carried out and explains their possible benefits and risks.</p>.<p>The NCI Web site includes a section on clinical trials at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials. It has general information about clinical trials as well as detailed information about specific ongoing studies of brain tumors. NCI's Information Specialists at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) and at LiveHelp (http://www.cancer.gov/livehelp) can answer questions and provide information about clinical trials.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
