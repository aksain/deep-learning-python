These are the structures that urine passes through before being eliminated from the body.</p>.<p>Any part of this system can become infected. As a rule, the farther up in the urinary tract the infection is located, the more serious it is.</p>.<p>In the United States, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">urinary tract infections</a> account for more than 10 million visits to medical offices and hospitals each year.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_a_urinary_tract_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The urine is normally sterile. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the urine and begin to grow. The bacterial infection usually starts at the opening of the urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the urinary tract.</p>.<p>The following people are at increased risk of urinary tract infection:</p>.<p>The following special groups may be at increased risk of urinary tract infection:</p>.<p><b><a name="are_urinary_tract_infections_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a>.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_urinary_tract_infection_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms develop rapidly and may or may not include the symptoms for a lower urinary tract infection.</p>.<p>In newborns, infants, children, and elderly people, the classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection may not be present. Other symptoms may indicate a urinary tract infection.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Pregnant</a> women are at increased risk for an UTI. Typically, pregnant women do not have unusual or unique symptoms. If a woman is pregnant, her urine should be checked during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prenatal</a> visits because an unrecognized infection can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> health complications.</p>.<p>Although most people have symptoms with a urinary tract infection, some do not.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of urinary tract infection</a> can resemble those of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sexually transmitted diseases</a>.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_people_seek_medical_care_for_a_uti" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Any adult or child who develops any of the symptoms of a urinary tract infection needs to be evaluated by a medical professional, preferably within 24 hours. Most medical offices can test urine for infection by using a quick urine "dipstick" test.</p>.<p>If someone has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection and any of the following applies, he or she may be at risk for complications of the urinary tract infection.</p>.<p>Infants, children, and elderly people with any of the signs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of UTI</a> should see their health care professional as soon as possible or go to an emergency department for evaluation.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_a_urinary_tract_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection is based on information someone gives about his or her symptoms, medical and surgical history, medications, habits, and lifestyle. A physical examination and lab tests complete the evaluation.</p>.<p>A health care professional may simply perform a urine dipstick test in the office. Only a few minutes are needed to obtain results. Your health care provider may also send a urine sample to the lab for culture testing (see below). These results take a few days to come back. This tells the doctor the exact bacteria causing the infection and to which antibiotics these bacteria have resistance or sensitivity. The culture is usually sent for special populations, including men, because they are less likely to get UTIs. It is not necessary to send a culture for everyone because the majority of UTIs are caused by the same bacteria.</p>.<p>For a culture specimen, the patient will be asked to give a clean-catch, midstream urine specimen. This avoids contamination of the urine with bacteria from the skin. Patients will be instructed in how to do this.</p>.<p>If someone cannot produce a urine specimen or is unable to follow instructions for a clean-catch specimen, a health care professional may obtain a urine specimen by catheterization.</p>.<p>Depending on their symptoms, sexually active women could require a pelvic examination because pelvic infections can have similar symptoms as a urinary tract infection. Males will require a genital examination, and depending on the symptoms, most likely a prostate examination. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.</p>.<p>Men will most likely require a rectal examination so that the prostate can be checked. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.</p>.<p>Rarely, an imaging test may be indicated to detect any underlying problem in the urinary tract that could cause an infection. This is usually only necessary in repeat infections or special circumstances (unusual bacteria, suspected anatomic abnormalities).</p>.<p>Imaging tests are most often needed for the following groups:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kinds_of_doctors_treat_urinary_tract_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most urinary tract infections can be treated by your primary care doctor (including family medicine and internal-medicine specialists, as well as gynecologists) or your child's pediatrician. They are usually the best provider to treat you as they are most familiar with your medical history, medications you are taking, and other factors that might affect your treatment. If you seek treatment in an urgent care facility, a specialist in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> may be involved in your care.</p>.<p>If there are frequent reoccurrences of UTIs or if complicating circumstances are present, your primary care doctor might refer you to a urologist, a physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the urinary system.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_home_remedies_for_a_urinary_tract_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a variety of self-care measures (home remedies) and other treatments available for urinary tract infections.</p>.<p>Because the symptoms of a urinary tract infection mimic those of other conditions, someone should see a health care professional if a urinary tract infection is suspected. A urine test is needed to confirm an infection. Self-care is not recommended.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_urinary_tract_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The usual treatment for both simple and complicated urinary tract infections is antibiotics.
