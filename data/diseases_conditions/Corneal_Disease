Its transparency permits light to pass into the eye, through the pupil, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lens</a>, and onto the retina at the back of the eye. The three major corneal layers are the outer layer of the cornea or epithelial layer, the middle layer termed the stroma, and finally a single layer of cells called the endothelium.</p>.<p>The curvature of the cornea plays an important role in focusing (refracting or bending) light. The normal cornea is smooth, clear, and tough. It helps protect the eye from infection and foreign material.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_corneal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several common causes of corneal disease, including the following:</p>.<p>The cornea can also be damaged secondarily by other common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eye conditions</a> such as tear film abnormalities (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dry eye</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> disorders, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a>, and iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE), which may be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/glaucoma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">glaucoma</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_and_risk_factors_of_corneal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The causes of corneal disease vary widely. The conditions listed above are due to hereditary (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>) causes, infection, trauma, autoimmune disorders, nutritional deficiencies, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>, secondary causes (other eye diseases that also affect the cornea), growths, and tumors among others.</p>.<p>Risk factors similarly vary depending on the individual's circumstances. Some risk factors are not modifiable, such as inherited genetic conditions. Others might be avoidable by limiting exposure to trauma and infection. In many people, prompt treatment of a corneal disease in its early stages will minimize the severity of the disease and its complications.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_corneal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs of corneal problems can include redness around the cornea and/or corneal cloudiness.

For more advanced corneal conditions, particularly those requiring surgery, an ophthalmologist (medical doctor/eye surgeon) or a corneal specialist (an ophthalmologist who has undergone additional fellowship training) would provide treatment. Additional specialists such as oculoplastic surgeons (ophthalmologists who specialize in eyelid and orbital surgery), rheumatologists, infectious disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergy</a> specialists, and others may be consulted when the cornea is secondarily affected by other medical conditions.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_corneal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An eye doctor will review the person's medical history and perform a careful examination of the eyes and eyelids. The cornea is examined in detail using a slit lamp microscope. Additional medical testing that can provide information needed to make a diagnosis may include topography and keratometry (to study the shape of the cornea), pachymetry (to measure the thickness of the cornea), specialized microscopy (providing detailed pictures to assess the health of the endothelial cells, or to identify infectious agents), and assessment of the tear film. In some individuals, cultures, biopsies, or blood tests are also necessary.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_corneal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment is tailored to the individual disease and the individual patient. Treatments might include medications, laser treatment, or surgery, depending on the condition.</p>.<p>Infections are treated with medicated eyedrops (antibiotics, antivirals, and antiparasitics) and, in some cases, oral medication. Herpetic stromal keratitis is a recurring swelling that develops after a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/herpes_of_the_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt"><span class="CrossLinkHighLight">herpes</span><span style="display:none"></span> eye infection</a> and is managed with anti-inflammatory steroid eyedrops.</p>.<p>An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abrasion</a> might require temporary patching or a bandage contact lens, depending on the cause and extent of the injury.</p>.<p>Keratoconus, in which the cornea can take on a distorted cone shape, is often managed with special <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contact lenses</a>. Newer treatments, including corneal crosslinking (riboflavin and ultraviolet-A) and corneal implants, are also options. Advanced keratoconus diseases are treated with anterior lamellar keratoplasty or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">corneal transplant</a> surgery.</p>.<p>Chronic swelling from Fuchs' dystrophy or other conditions that damage the cornea's endothelial cells are managed initially with salty eyedrops or ointments that help prevent accumulation of fluid within the cornea. If the conditions worsens, an endothelial lamellar keratoplasty (a type of partial thickness transplant surgery) may be indicated.</p>.<p>Research is under way to develop an artificial cornea for transplantation.</p>.<p>Autoimmune disorders are best treated by addressing the underlying disease. Corneal involvement is often managed with anti-inflammatory eyedrops such as steroids; however, steroid-sparing immune-modulating medications are sometimes preferable, particularly when other parts of the body are also involved.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Eye problems</a> caused by vitamin A deficiency, which can be seen in patients who have had certain types of bariatric (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>) surgery, can be corrected with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a>.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Allergic</a> eye disease responds well to both topical and oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergy</a> medication.</p>.<p>A pterygium is a growth on the cornea's surface; this is most commonly seen after chronic sun exposure.

Aside from lubricating the eyes with artificial tears, addressing the underlying cause is important. In some individuals, dryness is due to lack of tear production, and anti-inflammatory drops such as cyclosporin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Restasis</a>) or steroids may help. In other cases, the dryness is due to evaporation of the tears between blinks. This occurs when the eyelids' oil glands (meibomian glands) are not functioning well. Normally, the oil from these glands coats the eye's surface and prevents tear evaporation. The oil glands' function can be improved with a combination of warm compresses, lid hygiene (for example, dilute baby shampoo lid scrubs), increased intake of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">omega-3 fatty acids</a>, and in some patients, oral medication.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_potential_complications_of_corneal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many corneal diseases are treatable and have a good prognosis.

For example, maintaining optimal eye health (with good hygiene and regular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccinations</a>) is the best prevention against many infectious diseases. For example, there are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> available to reduce the severity and frequency of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shingles</a>, which can result in an eye herpes infection called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">herpes zoster</a> ophthalmicus. Contact lens wear can make individuals especially susceptible to serious corneal infections, so people should clean contact lenses as directed. Glasses and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eyeglasses_sunglasses_and_magnifiers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunglasses</a> with 100% ultraviolet block can protect against growths that are associated with sun exposure, such as pterygium, and eye surface cancers. Safety glasses should be worn when warranted to prevent trauma. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> rich in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">omega-3 fatty acids</a> and sufficient vitamin A may help maintain a healthy tear film, thus minimizing dry eye symptoms.
