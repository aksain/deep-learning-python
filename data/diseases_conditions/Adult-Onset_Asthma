This decreased lung function may cause doctors to miss the diagnosis of adult-onset asthma.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_adult-onset_asthma_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your asthma doctor may diagnose adult-onset asthma by:</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anyone can get asthma at any age.

These categories are: mild intermittent; mild persistent; moderate persistent; and severe persistent. Your physician will determine the severity and control of your asthma based on how frequently you have symptoms and on lung function tests. It is important to note that a person's asthma symptoms can change from one category to another.</p>.<p><b>Mild intermittent asthma</b></p>.<p><b>Mild persistent asthma</b></p>.<p><b>Moderate persistent asthma</b></p>.<p><b>Severe persistent asthma</b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_asthma_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Asthma can be controlled, but there's no asthma cure. There are, however, certain goals in asthma treatment. If you are unable to achieve all of these goals, it means your asthma is not under control. You should contact your asthma care provider for help with asthma.</p>.<p>Treatment goals include the following:</p>.<p>Properly using asthma medication, as prescribed by your doctor, is the basis of good asthma control, in addition to avoiding triggers and monitoring daily asthma symptoms. There are two main types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_medications/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma medications</a>:</p>.<p>Asthma medications can be taken by inhaling the medications (using a metered dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or asthma nebulizer) or by swallowing oral medications (pills or liquids). If you are also taking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> for other conditions, you should work with your providers to check <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_interactions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drug interactions</a> and simplify medications when possible.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="monitoring_asthma_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An important part of treatment is keeping track of how well the lungs are functioning. Asthma symptoms are monitored using a peak flow meter. The meter can alert you to changes in the airways that may be a sign of worsening asthma. By taking daily peak flow readings, you can learn when to adjust medications to keep asthma under good control. Your doctor can also use this information to adjust your treatment plan.</p>.<p><b><a name="asthma_action_plan" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Based on your history and the severity of your asthma, your doctor will develop a care plan called an asthma action plan. The asthma action plan describes when and how to use asthma medications, actions to take when asthma worsens, and when to seek care for an asthma emergency. Make sure you understand this plan; if not, ask your asthma care provider any questions you may have.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b></p>.<p class="credits">Reviewed by William Blahd, MD on July 20, 2016<br><br>Â© 2017 WebMD, LLC.
