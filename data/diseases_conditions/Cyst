<p><b><a name="cyst_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A cyst is a closed capsule or sac-like structure, usually filled with liquid, semisolid, or gaseous material. Cysts usually occur within almost any type of the body's tissue; they vary in size from microscopic to large structures that can displace internal organs. Although cysts can also refer to any normal bag or sac formation in the body, in this article, we will use the definition stated above and consider it to be an abnormal formation. Consequently, the cysts discussed below are not normal parts of the body. They have distinct membranes or cyst walls. If the sac is filled with pus, it is usually considered an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abscess</a>, not a cyst.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_cysts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are hundreds of different types of cysts. Cysts can occur almost anywhere in the body (for example, on the face, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">scalp</a> or back, behind the knee, arm, groin, and within organs like the liver, ovaries, kidneys, or brain). The majority of cysts are benign, but a few may contain malignant cells. The following lists some of the cyst types that may be found in the body:</p>.<p>Some lesions are termed cysts but often are more accurately named in the medical literature with a different term. For example:</p>.<p>Readers should note that many cysts types are not listed above. The purpose of this article is to give the reader an introduction to the hundreds of types of cysts and is not meant to be all-inclusive.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many causes of cyst formation. The following are some of the major causes of cyst formation:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The risk factors for a cyst depend on the underlying cause. Genetic conditions, defects in developing organs, infections, tumors, and any obstructions to the flow of fluid or oils or other substances are risk factors for cyst development.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_cyst_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of small cysts have no symptoms or signs. However, sometimes the cysts can be felt as a lump or bump in the skin or even in the tissues beneath the skin. Sometimes these cysts are painful. Cysts not associated with the skin but with internal organs may not produce any symptoms if they are small. If the cysts become large and displace or compress other organs or block normal fluid flows in tissues like the liver, pancreas, or other organs, then symptoms related to those organs may develop.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_treat_cysts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The type of doctor that treat cysts depend on the underlying cause of the cyst and the symptoms, if any, that are produced by the cyst. Usually a primary-care doctor is the first one who should be consulted when you notice a cyst. For example, a small epidermoid cyst that causes no symptoms would not require treatment. However, a large cyst in the abdomen displacing internal organs would require a surgeon to remove it. Consequently, many different physician specialists may be involved (OB/GYN, surgeon, orthopedic, gastroenterologist, ENT, dermatologist, infectious disease, or oncologist, for example) depending on the cyst's size, location, composition, and underlying cause.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some cysts are easily palpated by the doctor, especially if the cysts are located in the skin or in organs that are readily palpable, like the thyroid gland. Imaging studies such as ultrasound, X-ray, CAT scans, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRIs</a> are very useful in finding cysts. In addition, needle biopsies are sometimes used to determine if malignant tissue is associated with a cyst-like structure. In addition, needle biopsy may be used to reduce the size of the cyst.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for a cyst depends on the underlying cause of the cyst and whether or not the cyst is causing the patient problems. As stated previously, many cysts are benign and require no treatment. However, large cysts can result in symptoms due to compression of normal tissue and obstruction of ducts. Some of these cysts can be treated by simply aspirating the cyst contents through a needle or catheter, thereby collapsing the cyst. Other cysts require surgical removal (some cysts like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovarian_cysts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ovarian cysts</a> can be removed by laparoscopic surgery), especially if there's any suspicion of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">malignancy</a>. In general, cysts that cause symptoms are treated by draining them and/or removing them surgically; medical treatment is usually limited to reducing associated symptoms of their underlying cause(s). Individuals should discuss with their doctors about the best methods to use to get rid of their cysts.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_home_remedies_for_cysts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Self-treatment by squeezing or popping a cyst is not advised because it could exacerbate the underlying cause in some individuals; in addition, it may cause the cyst to enlarge or become infected. There are many home remedies for treatment of certain cyst types. Most use topical treatments such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tea_tree_oil-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tea tree oil</a>, aloe vera, castor oil, and many other compounds with the goal of rupturing the cyst. Check with a doctor before using these home remedies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of a cyst depends upon its underlying cause and sometimes on its size. The majority of cysts are small and benign; they require no treatment and have a good prognosis. However, cysts that are associated with infective agents or contain malignant cells or are so large they interfere with normal body functions have a more guarded prognosis. Some benign but large cysts may have a fair to good prognosis but may require surgery or aspiration to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Cysts may be recurring; this may happen in some cysts when only the cyst contents are reduced or removed and the cyst covering or lining remains; others may reoccur due to underlying causes.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_a_cyst" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most cysts are not preventable; however, if an underlying cause of a cyst is prevented, then the resultant cyst may also be prevented (for example, cysts due to infectious agents).<span id="cntid"></span></p>
