Cunha, DO, FACOEP</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_hypoparathyroidism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hypoparathyroidism is a condition in which the body doesn't make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). </p>.<p>This hormone regulates the amount of calcium and phosphorus in your body's bones and blood. Decreased levels of PTH lead to low levels of calcium and high levels of phosphorus in the blood. This imbalance can lead to problems with bones, muscles, skin, and nerve endings. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_hypoparathyroidism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is injury to the parathyroid glands, such as during head and neck surgery. Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands that are located in the neck behind the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid</a> gland. </p>.<p>It other cases, hypoparathyroidism is present at birth or may be associated with an autoimmune disease that affects the parathyroids along with other glands in the body, such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid</a>, ovaries, or adrenal glands. </p>.<p>Hypoparathyroidism is very rare. It is different from hyperparathyroidism, a much more common condition in which the body makes too much PTH. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_hypoparathyroidism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism may include: </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hypoparathyroidism_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The goal of treatment for hypoparathyroidism is to restore the body's calcium and phosphorus to normal levels. Calcium carbonate and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutritional_health_vitamin_d_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin D</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a> are the only currently approved treatment. However, NIH studies have shown the investigational drug PTH to work well as an alternative therapy. </p>.<p>If hypoparathyroidism is diagnosed and treated early, outcomes are usual good and the body grows normally. </p>.<p>If hypoparathyroidism is left untreated, complications can include a blocked <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">airway</a> due to severe muscle spasms, stunted growth, malformed teeth, development of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/cataracts_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataracts</a>, and calcium deposits in the brain.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
