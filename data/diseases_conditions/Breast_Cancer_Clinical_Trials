<p><b><a name="what_is_a_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A clinical trial is a research program conducted with patients to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug or device. The purpose of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a> clinical trial is to find new and improved methods of treating the disease. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Clinical trials</a> make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances to patient care.</p>.<p>During a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a> clinical trial, researchers, usually physicians, use the best available treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. These treatments may be a new drug, surgery or an alternative medicine.</p>.<p>First, researchers study new treatment options in the laboratory in test tubes and animals. If those results are promising, new treatments are further evaluated in a small group of people, and, finally, in a larger clinical trial.</p>.<p>When a new medical treatment is studied for the first time in humans, no one knows exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help physicians discover the answers to these questions:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_breast_cancer_clinical_trials" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>All clinical trials are conducted in phases, each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous stages.</p>.<p>Participants may be eligible for clinical trials in different phases, depending on their health. Most clinical trial participants take part in Phases III and IV.</p>.<p><b>Phase I clinical trials</b> study the safety of the new treatment.</p>.<p><b>Phase II clinical trials</b> occur if the treatment is found to be safe in the phase 1 trial. Phase II studies look at whether the treatment is effective.</p>.<p><b>Phase III clinical trials</b> compare the new treatment with the standard treatment to determine if it's any better.</p>.<p>If a treatment does well in phase II studies, it is often approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>.<p><b>Phase IV clinical trials</b> occur after the drug is approved FDA. These studies look at ways to use the new treatment more effectively. For example, in phase IV trials researchers may test a drug in combination with other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>. Or they may study a new dose. Or they may study the drug's effectiveness to treat a particular disease or a select group of patients.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_advantages_of_participating_in_a_breast_cancer_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_disadvantages_of_participating_in_a_breast_cancer_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="who_looks_out_for_me_if_i_decide_to_enroll_in_breast_cancer_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Clinical trial participants are willing volunteers. Even though patients may be asked by their physicians to take part in a clinical trial, it is up to you to make the final decision. However, there are many safeguards in place to look out for the welfare of volunteers. These safeguards can't guarantee that you won't have complications, but they try to reduce risk as much as possible.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_if_i_join_a_breast_cancer_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before you take part in any research study, you will be asked to give informed consent to participate. Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The physicians and nurses conducting the study will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks.</p>.<p>You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the physician or nurse to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. (See the section, "Important Questions to Ask".)</p>.<p>You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way.</p>.<p>Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments.</p>.<p>The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a breast <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_can_participate_in_a_breast_cancer_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate.
