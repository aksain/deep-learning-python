<p><b><a name="dyslexia_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dyslexia has been around for a long time and has been defined in different ways. For example, in 1968, the World Federation of Neurologists defined dyslexia as "a disorder in children who, despite conventional classroom experience, fail to attain the language skills of reading, writing, and spelling commensurate with their intellectual abilities." The International Dyslexia Association offers the following definition of dyslexia:</p>.<p class="style1">"<i>Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.</i>"
	</p>.<p>Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in children and persists throughout life. The severity of dyslexia can vary from mild to severe. The sooner dyslexia is treated, the more favorable the outcome. However, it is never too late for people with dyslexia to learn to improve their language skills.</p>.<p>Dyslexia can go undetected in the early grades of schooling. Children can 
become frustrated by the difficulty in learning to read. It is important to note 
that other problems can disguise dyslexia such as a child may:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children with dyslexia have difficulty in learning to read despite traditional instruction, at least average intelligence, and adequate motivation and opportunity to learn. It is thought to be caused by impairment in the brain's ability to process phonemes (the smallest units of speech that make words different from each other). It does not result from vision or hearing problems. It is not due to mental retardation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain damage</a>, or a lack of intelligence.</p>.<p>
 The causes of dyslexia vary with the type. In primary dyslexia, much research focuses on the hereditary factors.  Researchers have recently identified specific genes identified as possibly contributing to the signs and symptoms of dyslexia.  This research is very important because this may permit the identification of those children at risk for developing dyslexia and allow for earlier educational interventions and better outcomes.

They 
may detect early signs that suggest further assessment by a psychologist or 
other healthcare professional in order to actually diagnose the disorder. </p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of dyslexia</p>.<p>Auditory problems in dyslexia encompass a variety of functions. </p>.<p>Many subtle signs can be observed in children with dyslexia. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_parents_or_caregivers_do_if_they_suspect_a_child_has_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is important to consult your pediatrician if you are concerned about your child's development. Additionally, meeting with your child's teachers is an important step toward getting more answers.</p>.<p>Ideally, every school has a team that meets on a regular basis to discuss 
problems a specific child might be having. These teams are made up of the 
principal, classroom teacher, and one or a combination of the following 
depending on the staffing of the school such as </p>.<p>A parent should always be included as a part of this team. The teams are commonly referred to as </p>.<p>Any parent or teacher who suspects a learning problem may request a meeting with this team to discuss the child's problem. The parent may request this even if the teacher feels the child is doing well. Sometimes a decision to test the child will be made. The parent or teacher may request testing, but it cannot be done without the parents' written permission.</p>.<p>If the child attends a private school which lacks the appropriate professionals to evaluate a suspected learning problem, he should be referred to the public-school system for evaluation. If testing is not satisfactorily conducted in the public-school system for private or public school students, the parent will need to locate the appropriate health professionals for assessment. A list of resources is provided at the conclusion of this article.</p>.<p>Because testing can sometimes be stressful for children, especially if they are unhappy about their school performance, alternative strategies are usually tried before testing is done. Once the assessment plan has been discussed with the parent(s) and they have granted permission, the school team completes the testing and holds a meeting with the parent(s) to discuss the test results.</p>.<p>The assessment plan for each child depends on the specific problems the child is having. Each plan should include testing in five areas:  </p>.<p>The testing will be done by the various members of the school team or the professionals consulted by the parent. Typically, the school or clinical psychologist determines whether or not the child has dyslexia. Since there are different forms of dyslexia, such as learning disability in reading, written language, or math, the psychologist diagnoses the specific type. Another form known as expressive language delay can be diagnosed by a speech therapist.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dyslexia is a difficult disorder to diagnose. There are many factors the psychologist or other health professional reviews to diagnose the disability. The testing determines the child's functional reading level and compares it to reading potential, which is evaluated by an intelligence test. All aspects of the reading process are examined to pinpoint where the breakdown is occurring. The testing further assesses how a child takes in and processes information and what the child does with the information. The tests determine whether a child learns better by </p>.<p>They also assess whether a child performs better when allowed to give information (output), by saying something (oral), or by doing something with their hands (tactile-kinesthetic). The tests also evaluate how all of these sensory systems (modalities) work in conjunction with each other.</p>.<p>The tests administered are standardized and are considered highly reliable. </p>.<p>A standard battery of tests can include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_type_of_treatment_is_available_for_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before any treatment is started, an evaluation must be done to determine the child's specific area of disability. While there are many theories about successful treatment for dyslexia, there is no actual cure for it. The school will develop a plan with the parent to meet the child's needs.
The plan may be implemented in a special education setting or in the regular 
classroom. An appropriate treatment plan will focus on strengthening the child's 
weaknesses while utilizing the strengths. A direct approach may include a 
systematic study of phonics. Techniques designed to help all the senses work 
together efficiently can also be used. Computers are powerful tools for these children and should be utilized as much as possible. The child should be taught compensation and coping skills. Attention should be given to optimum learning conditions and alternative avenues for student performance.</p>.<p>In addition to what the school has to offer, there are alternative treatment options available outside the school setting. Although alternative treatments are commonly recommended, there is limited research supporting the effectiveness of these treatments. In addition, many of these treatments are very costly, and it may be easy for frustrated parents to be misled by something that is expensive and sounds attractive.</p>.<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of any treatment plan is attitude. Children will be influenced by the attitudes of the adults around them. Dyslexia should not become an excuse for a child to avoid written work. Because the academic demands on a child with dyslexia may be great and the child may tire easily, work increments should be broken down into appropriate chunks. Frequent breaks should be built into class and homework time. Reinforcement should be given for efforts as well as achievements. Alternatives to traditional written assignments should be explored and utilized. Teachers are learning to deliver information to students in a variety of ways that are not only more interesting but helpful to students who may learn best by different techniques. Interactive technology is providing interesting ways for students to get feedback on what they have learned, in contrast to traditional paper-pencil tasks.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_person_with_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for children with dyslexia is variable and dependent on the cause.  In the case of primary dyslexia, the earlier the diagnosis is made and intervention started, the better the outcome. It is also important to focus on the child's self-esteem, since dealing with dyslexia can be extremely frustrating.  Lastly it is important to recognize that many well-known and successful individuals have suffered from dyslexia, including Albert Einstein and Steven Spielberg, just to name a couple.</p>.<p><b><a name="more_information_about_dyslexia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For further information regarding dyslexia, ask your child's pediatrician for assistance, contact your local public school district office, or one of the following:</p>.<p><a href="http://www.dyslexiainstitutes.com/" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" target="_blank">Dyslexia Institutes of America</a></p>.<p><a href="http://ldaamerica.org//" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" target="_blank">Learning Disabilities Association of America</a></p>.<p><a href="http://www.cec.sped.org/" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" target="_blank">Council for Exceptional Children</a></p>.<p><a href="http://www.ldonline.org" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" target="_blank">Learning Disabilities Online.org</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
