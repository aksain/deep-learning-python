<p><b><a name="barium_enema_series_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_barium_enema_series" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A lower GI series, also known as a barium enema, barium enema procedure, barium enema X-ray or double-contrast barium enema, is an X-ray test in which a white liquid, called barium, is infused through a catheter (tube) inserted through the anus and into the rectum until it fills the large bowel (colon). X-ray films of the colon then are taken so that the outline of the colon can be seen.    The barium enema and double contrast barium enema are used to define normal and abnormal anatomy of the colon and rectum. Colon and rectal abnormalities that can be detected include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diverticulosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diverticulosis</a>, polyps, dilation of the colon, Hirschsprung disease in infants, and colon cancers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_of_a_lower_barium_enema" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Distention of the colon is uncomfortable, but only a few patients find it very painful. Any X-ray test procedure involves some risk of radiation exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques which have been developed and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils. All radiology technologists are certified by national certifying boards.  </p>.<p>Women who are or may be pregnant should notify the doctor requesting the procedure and the radiology staff, as there is a potential risk of harm to the fetus with any radiation exposure.  Complications of barium enema examination are rare.  The tip of the enema catheter or distention of the colon can penetrate the wall of the colon and give rise to a localized infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abscess</a>) or peritonitis (generalized infection of the abdominal cavity).  This usually occurs only when excessive pressure is used to infuse the barium or there is already a diseased colon that is weakened.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_the_patient_prepare_for_a_lower_barium_enema_and_how_is_it_performed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Any internal or external materials that make an X-ray image less clear can interfere with the accuracy of a barium enema. Therefore, before undergoing a barium enema (lower GI), it is important to eliminate as much fecal material from the colon and rectum as is possible. Prior to the examination, a clear <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liquid_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">liquid diet</a> and cleansing enemas often are used to empty the colon. Further medications that help evacuate the bowel are usually used. This is called a bowel prep. External materials such as extra clothing, metallic devices, or jewelry are removed prior to the test. A radiologist (a doctor specializing in the use and interpretation of X-rays) and a radiology technologist work perform the procedure on the patient.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_the_patient_obtain_the_results_of_a_lower_barium_enema_series" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After the X-ray films are developed by the radiology technologist, they are transmitted to the radiologist, who interprets the body structures visualized on the X-ray film. An interpretation and report of the barium enema is forwarded to the doctor who requested the test usually within one to two days. The doctor then can review the results of the report with the patient. The actual films of the examination also can be sent to the health care practitioner if necessary.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
