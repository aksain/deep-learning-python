<p><b><a name="what_is_the_definition_of_homocysteine_what_is_it" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Homocysteine is an amino acid produced by the body by chemically altering adenosine. Amino acids are naturally made products, which are the building blocks of all the proteins in the body. Most labs report normal ranges of homocysteine as about 4-15 µml/L.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_elevated_homocysteine_levels_be_genetic_when_was_homocystinuria_discovered" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers.

McCully reported that children born with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genetic disorder</a> called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced atherosclerosis in their arteries.

In these conditions, the mediator molecules malfunction and are less efficient because of a minor abnormality in their structure. They also lead to elevation of homocysteine levels (above 15 µmol/L), although much milder than in homocystinuria (above 100 µmol/L), by slowing down the breakdown of homocysteine.</p>.<p></p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_homocysteine_levels_be_lowered" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eating cereals that are fortified with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/folic_acid-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">folic acid</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a> B6 and B12, can lower blood homocysteine levels.

Before data that are more scientific become available from the currently ongoing studies, many experts do not recommend a screening test for blood homocysteine levels, even in patients with unexplained <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> formation.

(For example, treatment of patients with high homocysteine levels may require higher doses of folic acid and other B vitamins than the amounts contained in a multivitamin.) Therefore, a decision regarding testing should be individualized after consulting with your doctor and/or a specialist in genetic diseases. Some researchers recommend treatment guidelines that result in levels of homocysteine below 100 µmol/L but say the recommendation may change (possibly lowered) with new data.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_lowering_homocysteine_level_prevent_heart_attacks_and_strokes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Currently, there is no direct proof that taking folic acid and B vitamins to lower homocysteine levels prevents <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_in_women/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a> and strokes.
