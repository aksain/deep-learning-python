<p><b><a name="myofascial_pain_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_myofascial_pain_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, and spasm. Myofascial pain syndrome usually involves muscle in body areas that are asymmetric or focal, whereas <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fibromyalgia</a> is typically a diffuse and symmetric muscle pain syndrome that involves both sides of the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_myofascial_pain_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of myofascial pain syndrome is unknown. Nevertheless, prior injury, poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> patterns, stressful life situations, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">depression</a> are common underlying conditions that may play a role in inciting and exacerbating myofascial pain syndrome. It is currently felt that risk factors such as these may lead to a change in the ability of the brain to properly process pain perception (referred to as central pain processing).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_myofascial_pain_syndrome_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Myofascial pain syndrome causes localized muscle pain. Affected muscles cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neck_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">neck pain</a>, upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">back pain</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lower back pain</a>, generally affecting one side of the body or one side of the body much more than the other. There is commonly tenderness and spasm in the painful areas and there may be tenderness in areas that are not feeling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic pain</a>.</p>.<p>It is also common for patients with myofascial pain syndrome to have poor sleep patterns with decreased recovery sleep (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">non-rapid eye movement sleep</a>). This is associated with awakening feeling unrested and daytime <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">fatigue</a>. Stiffness after inactivity is common.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialties_of_doctors_treat_myofascial_pain_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Myofascial pain syndrome is commonly treated by primary-care physicians, including family medicine doctors, general practitioners, and internists. Other physicians who treat myofascial pain syndrome include physiatrists, orthopedists, and rheumatologists.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health-care_professionals_diagnose_myofascial_pain_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Physicians diagnose myofascial pain syndrome based on the areas of complaints of muscle pain and associated tenderness during a physical examination. Extensive laboratory testing is usually unnecessary. There are no appearance changes (redness, warmth, swelling, etc.) in areas of involvement. The appearance is the same as similar areas on the other side of the body. The widespread, diffuse body involvement that is typical of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">fibromyalgia</a> is not present.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_myofascial_pain_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Optimal treatment of myofascial pain syndrome can be a multifaceted approach. This can include education of the patient, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> reduction, stretching and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> programs as well as physical therapy rehabilitation, sleep improvement, and medications all best organized by a single physician who tailors the therapies over time by customizing them for the individual patient.</p>.<p>Medications used to treat myofascial pain syndrome can be directed toward various features of the individual's condition and may be used temporarily or longer term. Often trials of medications are used to find the best treatment for the particular patient.
