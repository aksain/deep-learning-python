Together, they are part of a ring of glandular tissue (Waldeyer's ring) encircling the back of the throat.</p>.<p>The tonsils and adenoids are thought to assist the body in its defense against incoming bacteria and viruses by helping the body form antibodies. However, this function may only be important during the first year of life. There is no evidence to support a significant role of the tonsils and adenoids in immunity. Medical studies have shown that children who have their tonsils and adenoids removed suffer no loss in their future immunity to disease or ability to ward off infections.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_tonsillitis_or_adenoid_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most prominent symptom of tonsillitis and adenoid infection is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sore throat</a>.

It also causes extreme malaise and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tiredness</a>. The sore throat and gland swelling can last for one week to a month and does not respond to the usually prescribed antibiotics.</p>.<p>Chronic tonsillitis is a persistent infection of the tonsils. Repeated infections may cause the formation of small pockets (crypts) in the tonsils which harbor bacteria. Frequently, small, foul smelling stones are found within these crypts. These stones (tonsilloliths) may contain high quantities of sulfa. When crushed, they give off the characteristic rotten egg smell which causes bad breath. They may also give a patient the sense of something being caught in the back of the throat.</p>.<p>A peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus around the tonsils that pushes one of the tonsils toward the uvula (the prominent soft tissue dangling from the back of the upper throat). It is generally very painful and is associated with decreased ability to open the mouth. If left untreated, the infection can spread deep in the neck causing life-threatening complications and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">airway</a> obstruction.</p>.<p>Obstruction to breathing by enlarged tonsils and adenoids may cause snoring and disturbed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> patterns that may lead to sleep pauses or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep apnea</a>.</p>.<p>Other signs and symptoms include:</p>.<p>Some orthodontists believe chronic mouth breathing from large tonsils and adenoids causes improper alignment of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">teeth</a> (malocclusion).</p>.<p>Chronic enlargement and infection of the adenoids may lead to infection of the air passages around the nose (sinusitis) or nasal drainage/obstruction, and/or may affect the Eustachian tube of the ears, leading to chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/middle_ear_infection_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">ear infections</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_tonsillitis_and_adenoid_infections_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diagnosis of tonsillitis and adenoid infection is based on a medical history and a physical exam.</p>.<p>If symptoms suggest strep throat, the doctor may order a throat culture or rapid strep test, which are done by swabbing the back of the throat and checking for the <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Streptococcus</a></i> bacteria. This can be performed in the doctor's office. If the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause mononucleosis, is suspected as a cause for the tonsillitis, a blood test for mononucleosis may be done.</p>.<p>Strep throat is more likely if at least three of the following signs or symptoms are present:</p>.<p>Antibiotic treatment may be needed if the infection is caused by bacteria. In more severe, recurrent or chronic cases, surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids (tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy) may be recommended to cure the condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medical_treatments_antibiotics_cure_tonsillitis_and_adenoid_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bacterial infections of the tonsils and adenoids are treated with various antibiotics. Tonsillitis caused by the <i>Streptococcus</i> bacteria can lead to serious complications. Once treatment begins, it is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed because if you stop taking the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> before they are finished it can lead to adverse consequences and regrowth of the bacteria. Surgical removal is considered in situations resistant to medical therapy or in frequently recurrent infections.</p>.<p>Viral causes of tonsillitis or enlarged adenoids are often treated with only supportive care (hydration and control of fever). Antibiotics are not effective for viral infection of the tonsils.</p>.<p>A peritonsillar abscess should be drained either by removal of fluid with a needle and syringe (needle aspiration), cutting open with a scalpel (incision), or tonsillectomy. Chronic stones in the tonsil can be removed with a clean finger or with a blunt probe. Massive enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids causing airway obstruction may be treated with a long course of antibiotics, or even a brief course of steroids to reduce inflammation (cortisone-related medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisolone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisolone</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_or_home_remedies_help_soothe_tonsillitis_pain_and_inflammation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If a doctor has diagnosed tonsillitis, there are some home remedies that can help soothe the symptoms of a sore throat.</p>.<p>Some alternative remedies may help ease tonsillitis symptoms.</p>.<p>Consult your doctor before using any alternative remedies. Many of these home remedies are not recommended for use in children or adolescents, most have not been scientifically evaluated.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_the_tonsils_and/or_adenoids_be_removed_%0Atonsillectomy_or_adenoidectomy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are indicated in persons with repeated or persistent infections, particularly if they interfere with everyday activities. The American Academy of Otolaryngology defines repeated infections in children as seven episodes in one year, or five episodes in each of two years, or three episodes in each of three years.</p>.<p>Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are also warranted in situations where there is enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids to such an extent that it causes severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep problems</a> (snoring and breath holding), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sleep apnea</a>, dental abnormalities, and difficulty swallowing. Adenoid enlargement alone, or in combination with tonsillar enlargement, can cause nasal obstruction, recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ear infections</a>, or sinusitis. If these conditions are resistant to medical therapy, surgery is indicated to cure them.</p>.<p>A significant episode of tonsillitis is defined by one or more of the following criteria: (1) a temperature greater than 101 F (38.3 C); (2) enlarged or tender neck lymph nodes; (3) pus material coating the tonsils; or (4) a positive strep test.</p>.<p>In adults, the severity, frequency, and hardship associated with repeated infections are considered more important than the absolute number. Chronic infections characterized by bad breath and/or tonsillar stones causing significant disability are also indicators for tonsillectomy.</p>.<p>Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are strongly considered in those patients who are suffering, or may suffer serious complications of infection. These include peritonsillar abscess, history of streptococcal complications (rheumatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, glomerulonephritis), or neck abscess.

Additional factors, such as tolerance of antibiotics, concurrent medical problems, school achievement/progress, and family preferences are also important factors in the decision process.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_specialties_of_doctors_treat_tonsillitis_and_adenoid_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child's pediatrician may diagnose and treat simple tonsillitis and adenoid infections. If your tonsillitis is severe enough that you go to an emergency department, you will be seen by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> specialist. If infections are severe, chronic, or recurrent, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, also called an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist for further treatment or surgical removal of the tonsils and/or adenoids.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
