<p><b><a name="what_is_methemoglobinemia_beta-globin_type" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Beta-globin type methemoglobinemia is an inherited blood disorder. It disrupts the function of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemoglobin</a>, the molecule in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a> that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. Methemoglobinemia is characterized by increased levels of an atypical form of hemoglobin that is unable to deliver oxygen efficiently.</p>.<p>In most individuals with beta-globin type methemoglobinemia, the only symptom is cyanosis, which is a bluish appearance of the skin, mucous membranes, or the area underneath the fingernails due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. Symptoms may appear as early as age 3 to 4 months. Methemoglobinemia symptoms do not improve when affected individuals are given additional oxygen, because oxygen cannot bind effectively to the abnormal hemoglobin.

Heme molecules are necessary for red blood cells to pick up oxygen in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> and release oxygen to other cells in the body. Hemoglobin typically has two protein subunits call alpha-globin and two protein subunits called beta-globin. The HBB gene provides instructions for making beta-globin. Mutations in specific regions of the HBB gene lead to an atypical version of beta-globin known as hemoglobin M. Hemoglobin M interacts abnormally with heme molecules, which impairs the uptake of oxygen by red blood cells. As a result, a reduced amount of oxygen is delivered to cells throughout the body.</p>.<p>Other types of methemoglobinemia can be caused by abnormal alpha-globin, a shortage of a particular enzyme called NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, or unusual reactions to certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> or chemicals.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_inherit_methemoglobinemia_beta-globin_type" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_names_do_people_use_for_methemoglobinemia_beta-globin_type" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
