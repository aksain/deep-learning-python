<p><b><a name="introduction_to_the_sexual_response_cycle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The sexual response cycle refers to the sequence of physical and emotional changes that occur as a person becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexually stimulating activities, including intercourse and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/masturbation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">masturbation</a>. Knowing how your body responds during each phase of the cycle can enhance your relationship and help you pinpoint the cause of any sexual problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_phases_of_the_sexual_response_cycle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p></p>.<p></p>.<p>The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_health_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">orgasm</a>, and resolution. Both men and women experience these phases, although the timing usually is different. For example, it is unlikely that both partners will reach orgasm at the same time. In addition, the intensity of the response and the time spent in each phase varies from person to person. Understanding these differences may help partners better understand one another's bodies and responses, and enhance the sexual experience.</p>.<p><b><a name="phase_1_excitement" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>General characteristics of the excitement phase, which can last from a few minutes to several hours, include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="phase_2_plateau" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>General characteristics of the plateau phase, which extends to the brink of orgasm, include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="phase_3_orgasm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The orgasm is the climax of the sexual response cycle.

This phase is marked by a general sense of well-being, enhanced intimacy and, often, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>. Some women are capable of a rapid return to the orgasm phase with further sexual stimulation and may experience multiple orgasms. Men need recovery time after orgasm, called a refractory period, during which they cannot reach orgasm again. The duration of the refractory period varies among men and usually lengthens with advancing age.</p>.<p></p>.<p></p>.<p></p>.<p class="credits">SOURCE:<br>Discovery Health.<br>Reviewed by Robert S.
