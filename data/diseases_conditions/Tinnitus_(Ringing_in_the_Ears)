<p><b><a name="tinnitus_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_tinnitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease, and it has a variety of causes that may arise anywhere in the hearing mechanism. It begins in the ear with the tympanic membrane and the cochlea, where sound is transmitted 
and transformed into electrical energy for the brain to perceive.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_the_anatomy_of_the_ear_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_tinnitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_kind_of_doctor_treats_tinnitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Often tinnitus can be evaluated by a primary-care doctor or internist, but if consultation is needed, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor) is the specialist that evaluates and cares for 
people with tinnitus. Audiologists are trained to perform hearing tests and assessments. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_tinnitus_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The patient's history and description of symptoms is the key in determining what might be causing tinnitus.</p>.<p>The health-care professional may ask questions in regard to the quality of the abnormal sound, and whether it is constantly present or whether it comes and goes. Other questions may include the following:</p>.<p><b>Medications:</b> Be prepared to provide the health-care professional a list of medications including over-the-counter (OTC) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a> to review since tinnitus may be a side effect of certain medications.</p>.<p><b>Physical exam:</b> Physical examination will focus on the head and neck, and especially the ears, including the auditory canals and tympanic membranes. Since the sense of hearing is conducted through one of the cranial nerves (the short nerves that lead directly from the brain to the face, head and neck), a careful neurologic exam also may be performed. Weakness or numbness in the face, mouth, and neck may be associated with a tumor or other structural abnormality pressing on a nerve. The healthcare professional may listen to the flow in the carotid arteries in the neck for an abnormal sound (bruit), since carotid artery stenosis (narrowing of the artery) can transmit a sound to the ear that may cause tinnitus.</p>.<p><b>Hearing test:</b> An audiogram or hearing test may be performed to look for associated hearing loss in one or both ears.</p>.<p><b>Imaging:</b> Depending upon the suspected underlying cause of tinnitus, radiology tests may be performed to image the head and neck, including the structures of the ear. These imaging tests may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>.</p>.<p><b>Referral to a specialist:</b> Consultation with the appropriate specialist may be needed, both for diagnosis and treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_tinnitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tinnitus is a common complaint, with up to 15% of Americans having experienced it. It is the most common symptom reported by military service members returning from combat.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_home_remedies_soothe_tinnitus_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following home remedies may be of benefit to some individuals with tinnitus.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_treat_tinnitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_surgery_to_cure_tinnitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery may be a cure for certain people who have:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_retraining_therapy_and_relief_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are some behavioral and cognitive therapies that have been successful in treating tinnitus. Seeking out a multidisciplinary program at a medical center that specializes in tinnitus may improve treatment success.</p>.<p><i>Tinnitus retraining therapy</i> is a form of treatment that tries to retrain the nerve pathways associated with hearing that may allow the brain to get used to the abnormal sounds. Habituation allows the brain to ignore the tinnitus noise signal, and it allows the 
person to become unaware that it is present unless they specifically concentrate on the noise. This treatment involves counseling and wearing a sound generator. Audiologists and otolaryngologists often work together in offering this treatment.</p>.<p>In addition to tinnitus retraining therapy, other treatments exist which attempt to relieve tinnitus 
such as <i>relief therapy</i>, and each affected individual may benefit differently depending upon the cause of the tinnitus and their response to treatment. Some other treatment options include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="does_acupuncture_treat_tinnitus_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While scientific research has not shown the benefit of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acupuncture/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acupuncture</a> in the treatment of tinnitus, there may be a significant positive placebo effect.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_tinnitus_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Repeated loud noise exposure can be a cause of tinnitus as well as hearing loss. Loud music may cause short term symptoms, but repeated occupational exposure (for example, musicians, factory and construction workers) requires less intense sound levels to cause potential hearing damage leading to tinnitus. Minimizing sound exposure, therefore, decreases the risk of developing tinnitus. Sound protection equipment, like 
acoustic ear-muffs, may be appropriate at work and at home when exposed to loud noises.</p>.<p>A variety of medications may be ototoxic (damage the ear) 
and cause tinnitus. If tinnitus develops while you are taking a medication, stop the medication and discuss other options with your health-care professional.</p>.<p><b><a name="whats_being_done_in_research_on_tinnitus_treatments" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tinnitus remains a symptom that affects the lives of millions of people. Research is directed not only at its treatment, but also at understanding why it occurs. Research by doctors at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Dalhousie University (Canada), and Southeast China University have published research using electrophysiology and functional MRI to better understand what parts of the brain are involved in hearing and the production of tinnitus. Their research has found that much larger areas of the brain are involved with the process of hearing than previously believed, which may help direct future diagnostic and therapeutic options.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
