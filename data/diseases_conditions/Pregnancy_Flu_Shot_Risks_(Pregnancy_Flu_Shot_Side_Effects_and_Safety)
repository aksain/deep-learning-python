You will need to get the flu shot. 
<b>The nasal spray flu vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.</b> If you get the flu shot during your pregnancy, research shows it provides some protection to your baby both while you are pregnant and after the baby is born.</p>.<p>In addition, follow our everyday steps to keep you and your baby healthy this flu season.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_protect_my_baby_once_he_or_she_is_born" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Breastfeeding protects <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a> because 
breast milk passes your antibodies to your baby. The antibodies in breast milk help fight off infection. Studies show that babies who are breastfed do not get as sick and are sick less often than babies who are not breastfed.</p>.<p>

If you get the flu, do not stop breastfeeding. Unless directed by your health care provider, continue to nurse your baby while being treated for the flu.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="if_i_have_the_flu_what_should_i_do" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you get flu-like symptoms, contact your health care provider immediately. If necessary, your health care provider will prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat you. If you have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> you should take <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tylenol</a> (or the store brand equivalent).</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_get_emergency_care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="more_reasons_you_need_a_flu_shot_if_you_are_pregnant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you're pregnant, a flu shot is your best protection against serious illness from the flu. A flu shot can protect pregnant women, their unborn babies, and even the baby after birth.</p>.<p>
    
    If you're pregnant, a flu shot is your best protection against serious illnesses caused by the flu. </p>.<p>

The flu is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant women than in women who are not pregnant. Changes in the immune system, heart and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> during pregnancy make pregnant women more prone to severe illness from flu, which can lead to hospitalization or even death. A pregnant woman with the flu also has a greater chance of serious problems for her unborn baby, including miscarriage or preterm birth.</p>.<p>

<b>A flu shot can protect pregnant women, their unborn babies, and even the baby after birth.</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="the_flu_shot_is_the_best_protection_against_the_flu" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Getting a flu shot is the first and most important step in protecting against 
flu. When given during pregnancy, the flu shot has been shown to protect both 
the mother and her baby (up to 6 months old) from flu. The flu shot is safe to 
get at any time while you are pregnant, during any trimester. (The nasal spray 
vaccine should not be given to women who are pregnant.) </p>.<p><b><a name="the_flu_shot_is_safe_for_pregnant_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Flu shots are a safe way to protect pregnant women and their unborn children from serious illness and complications of flu, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>. The flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. It is very important for pregnant women to get the flu shot.</p>.<p><b><a name="early_treatment_is_important_for_pregnant_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you get sick with flu-like symptoms, call your doctor right away. If needed, the doctor will prescribe an antiviral medicine that treats the flu.</p>.<p>

Pregnant women who get a fever should treat it with a fever-reducing medicine containing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acetaminophen</a> (such as Tylenol) and contact their doctor as soon as possible.</p>.<p><b><a name="pregnancy_and_influenza_vaccine_safety" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Influenza</a> (flu) vaccine safety studies are reporting good news for pregnant women. This research was presented at the 49th Annual Meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in October 2011.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="influenza_vaccination_during_pregnancy_protects_newborns_from_getting_influenza" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnant women who get influenza vaccine pass their immunity to their babies in the form of flu antibodies. This protection lasts for several months after birth. Influenza protection was seen in newborns up to four months old. Babies born to women who were not vaccinated during pregnancy showed no antibody protection.</p>.<p><b><a name="influenza_vaccination_does_not_cause_miscarriage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Research shows no association between flu vaccination during pregnancy and 
miscarriage. This largest study conducted during the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">first trimester</a> showed pregnant women who got the flu vaccine were no more likely to miscarry than those who did not get the flu vaccine.</p>.<p><b><a name="more_pregnant_women_are_getting_vaccinated_against_influenza" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The number of pregnant women receiving influenza vaccine has increased dramatically in the last couple of years in large part due to a national effort to vaccinate against the 
2009 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swine_flu/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">H1N1</a> pandemic influenza during the 2009-10 influenza season. Prior to 2009, less than 15 percent of pregnant women got vaccinated. In the past two influenza seasons, over half of pregnant women were vaccinated.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
