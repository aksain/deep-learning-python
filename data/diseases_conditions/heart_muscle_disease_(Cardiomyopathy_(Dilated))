In some cases, it prevents the heart from relaxing and filling with blood as it should. Over time, it can affect the other heart chambers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_dcm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many people with dilated cardiomyopathy have no symptoms or only minor symptoms, and live a normal life.
