The common causes of these symptoms include the viruses that cause the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">common cold</a>, influenza virus, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic rhinitis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hay fever</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sinus infections</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sinusitis</a>). Viral infections can also cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, body aches, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, and sometimes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a>. Hay fever symptoms can also include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itchy</a> eyes, nose, and throat, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/watery_eye/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">watery eyes</a>.</p>.<p>To benefit from OTC products for cold, flu, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergy</a>, it is important to understand (1) the condition causing the symptoms, (2) the predominant symptom(s) one wishes to relieve, and (3) the active ingredient(s) in the product. Some OTC products contain a single active ingredient medication to relieve one symptom. Many others contain a combination of two, three, and even four active ingredient medications to treat several symptoms at once. Selecting the right product can be difficult at times.</p>.<p>Here we have categorized products for cold/flu/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergy</a> according to the predominant symptoms they relieve:</p>.<p>Since cold and flu sufferers usually experience several symptoms, products containing medication combinations provide convenience. Therefore, you may need to take only one product as compared with two to four products. You also may need to stock fewer items in the medicine cabinet. Nevertheless, it is preferable to take products that contain only those medications you need for relieving the symptoms that are present, and you may not need products designed to relieve multiple symptoms at once. This prevents the ingestion of unnecessary medications and reduces the chances of side effects. It is also easier to adjust the dose of a single ingredient medicine to maximize relief of a predominant symptom and minimize side effects.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_differences_between_allergy_cold_and_flu_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While colds, the flu, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a> may produce some similar symptoms, they are different conditions. Colds and flu are both viral illnesses that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sore throat</a>, muscle aches, cough, sneezing, and runny nose. In general, flu, or influenza, produces more severe symptoms than the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">common cold</a> and is commonly associated with fever (which may be high), body aches, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headache</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a> can also accompany the flu.

The three classes of analgesics/antipyretics that are available OTC are aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p>.<p>Some OTC products contain an analgesic/antipyretic as a single ingredient. Others combine an analgesic/antipyretic with a nasal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/natural_cold_flu_remedies_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">decongestant</a>, an antihistamine, or a cough suppressant. Products listed in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">headaches</a>, body aches, fever, and flu-like symptoms category contain an analgesic/antipyretic either alone or in combination with other ingredient(s) to treat cold/flu/allergy symptoms. Examples of products in the headaches, body aches, fever, and flu-like symptoms category include the following. Note that the products described in this article refer to brand name preparations. Less expensive, generic, over-the-counter medications are available that contain the same active ingredients as many if not all of these products.</p>.<p><b><a name="nasal_congestion_sneezing_and_runny_nose" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nasal congestion, sneezing, and runny nose are common symptoms of a cold caused by a virus. The viruses that cause colds induce inflammation that increases the leakage of fluid from the blood vessels into the lining of the nose and even into the nose. This causes swelling of the lining of the nose, obstructing the flow of air, and a runny nose.</p>.<p>Symptoms of hay fever, or allergic rhinitis, are caused by allergens. Allergens are tiny particles that cause cells in the lining of the nose and the airways of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> to release histamine and other chemicals. Histamine and these other chemicals are responsible for the leakage of fluid, runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion, as well as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a> of the eyes.</p>.<p>Cold symptoms usually resolve in one to two weeks whether treated or not. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, which are the cause of colds. However, bacterial infections that can follow viral infections, for example, infections of the ears and sinuses, may be treated with antibiotics. For the temporary relief of cold symptoms, plenty of oral fluids such as broth, chicken soup, and tea with lemon and honey and humidification of room air are safe remedies for people of all ages. Saline (salt and water) sprays and mists can also safely provide soothing moisture to dry, irritated nasal passages. In infants and young children, saline nose drops and clearing the nose with a nasal syringe can temporarily relieve nasal obstruction. Allowing infants and young children to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> upright in car seats also improves the drainage of nasal secretions.</p>.<p>For short-term relief of nasal congestion in older children and adults, nasal decongestants can be used. Nasal decongestants are chemicals (for example, pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, etc.) that narrow the blood vessels in the nose, thereby preventing fluid from leaking and the lining from swelling. As a result, the lining shrinks and the nasal passages open. Nasal decongestants can be used topically within the nose (nasal spray, solution, or mist) or can be taken orally (tablets, caplets, or gelcaps). Topical nasal decongestants act faster than the oral decongestants but have a shorter duration of action. Thus, more frequent dosing will be necessary. Oral nasal decongestants frequently are combined with an antihistamine, a cough suppressant, or an analgesic in treating cold/flu/allergy symptoms.</p>.<p>The first step in preventing and relieving <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of allergy</a> is to avoid the allergens, the particular substance that stimulates the allergic reaction. If avoiding allergens is not feasible or does not adequately control the allergic symptoms, antihistamines are commonly used to block the effect of histamines. Some of the antihistamines that are available OTC (diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, etc.) are called "first generation" antihistamines. These antihistamines have been in use longer, are less expensive, and are more sedating (more prone to cause drowsiness) than the newer "second generation" antihistamines (fexofenadine, loratadine, etc.), which have minimal sedative effects. OTC antihistamines frequently are combined with a nasal decongestant and sometimes also with a cough suppressant or an analgesic. Generally, antihistamine preparations are not effective for cold symptoms.</p>.<p>The following are some examples of products in the nasal congestion, sneezing, and runny nose category:</p>.<p><b><a name="cough" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A cough is a common symptom of viral respiratory infections and allergies. A cough can also be caused by other conditions, some of them serious. For example, a cough can be a symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acid reflux</a> into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">GERD</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sinusitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/postnasal_drip_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">postnasal drip</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_acute/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bronchitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cigarette smoking</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a>, hypersensitivity <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a> (inflammation of the lung from exposure to certain environmental chemicals), and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>. Therefore, a persistent cough or a cough that is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a>, fever, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>, or blood-tinged or discolored sputum should be evaluated by a doctor.</p>.<p>There are three types of cough medications available OTC for the temporary relief of cough due to a cold. They are oral cough suppressants, oral expectorants, and topical (externally applied) medicines.</p>.<p>Codeine and hydrocodone are narcotic oral cough suppressants that require a doctor's prescription. Dextromethorphan is an oral cough suppressant that is available OTC. Dextromethorphan is chemically related to codeine and acts on the brain to suppress cough, but it does not have the pain-relieving and addictive properties of codeine. Diphenhydramine is another non-narcotic medication that acts on the brain to suppress cough. It is also an antihistamine.</p>.<p>Dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine can be used to relieve a dry, hacking cough. They are not generally used to suppress a productive cough (when sputum is coughed up). Suppressing a productive cough impairs the clearing of secretions and mucous from the airways, which is generally undesirable. However, cough suppressants are sometimes used to suppress even productive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughs</a> if they are especially bothersome and prevent restful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a>.</p>.<p>Guaifenesin is an oral expectorant that is believed to increase the leaking of fluid out of the lung tissue and into the airways. This action thins (liquefies) the thick mucus in the airways and facilitates the clearing of the mucous by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a>. Clearing of mucous from the airways decreases cough.</p>.<p>Camphor and menthol are topical cough medications. Camphor and menthol ointments are rubbed on the throat and the chest as a thick layer. The anesthetic action of their vapors is believed to relieve cough. They are also available as products for steam <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inhalation</a>. Menthol is also available as lozenges and compressed tablets.</p>.<p>Examples of products in the cough category include the following:</p>.<p><b>Cough suppressants</b>: Buckley's Mixture, Diabe-Tuss DM, and St Joseph Cough Suppressant for Children and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dextromethorphan-oral_liquid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Delsym</a> (effective for 12 hours)</p>.<p><b>Expectorant</b>: Hytuss, Robitussin, Mucinex, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guaifenesin_with_pseudoephedrine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Duratuss</a> G, Muco-Fen</p>.<p><b>Topical cough medicines</b>: Hall's Mentho-Lyptus Cough Suppressant Drops, Mentholatum, Vick's VapoRub, and Vick's VapoSteam</p>.<p><b>Cough suppressant plus an expectorant and other cold/flu/allergy ingredients</b>: Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold and Cough, Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold and Flu, Comtrex Deep <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cold_and_flu_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Chest Cold</a> &amp; Congestion Relief, Coricidin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HBP</a> Cough and Cold Tablets, Dimetapp Cold and Cough Liqui-Gels Maximum Strength, PediaCare Cough-Cold Liquid and Chewable Tablets, Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough and Cold, TheraFlu Flu Cold and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough_medicine_and_cough_syrups/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cough Medicine</a>, and Triaminic AM Cough and Decongestant formula</p>.<p>Since many of these combinations also contain an antihistamine, a decongestant, and an analgesic in addition to the cough suppressant and expectorant, they also provide relief of nasal congestion, sneezing, fever, and aches.</p>.<p>In October 2000, an advisory panel of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that phenylpropanolamine (PPA), an ingredient contained in many OTC and prescription cold medications as well as weight-loss products, be classified as unsafe because of reports of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a> associated with the ingredient. It was removed from OTC sale in 2005 in the U.S.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="sore_throat_and_other_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Viruses are the most common cause of sore throat. A sore throat caused by a cold virus usually resolves in one to two weeks without treatment. On the other hand, a sore throat caused by the <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Streptococcus</a></i> bacterium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_throat_gas/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strep throat</a>) should be treated with antibiotics to prevent damage to the heart valves and other complications of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">strep</a> infection. Generally, <i>Streptococcus</i> bacteria cause a more severe sore throat and a higher fever than viral sore throats, but it is not always possible to distinguish the two without laboratory testing. Sneezing, runny nose, and cough more frequently accompany sore throats due to a cold virus, rather than <i>Streptococcus</i> infections. Sometimes, a throat culture or other lab test is necessary to establish the cause of the sore throat.</p>.<p>Medications that are available OTC for the temporary relief of sore throat due to the common cold usually contain anesthetics such as benzocaine and dyclonine or menthol and come in the form of lozenges, gargles, and sprays. Children often prefer popsicles, ice cream, yogurt, pudding, smoothies, or other cool/soft foods in lieu of traditional medications. Aside from their analgesic effects, these foods also provide some nutritional benefit.</p>.<p>Examples of sore throat medications include Cepacol Sore Throat Maximum Strength and Sucrets sore throat lozenges.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_vitamin_c_and_zinc" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vitamin C is an antioxidant. In the 1970s, Linus Pauling proposed that vitamin C could reduce the incidence and severity of common cold. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that megadoses of vitamin C prevent colds or decrease the severity and/or duration of cold symptoms. Medical research has suggested a small decrease in duration of cold symptoms in adults who took vitamin C <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a> regularly, but that vitamin C taken after the onset of symptoms had no effect on the duration of cold symptoms.</p>.<p>Zinc has been proposed as an antiviral medication. Some studies suggest that the frequent administration of zinc lozenges, tablets, or syrup may reduce the severity and duration of cold symptoms if started within hours of the onset of cold symptoms. However, certain side effects and toxicities, including loss of sense of smell, have been associated with some zinc preparations used to treat colds. In fact, the U.S. FDA has issued a public health advisory warning that three zinc-containing products for topical (intranasal) use should not be used due to the risk of developing this side effect.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_important_considerations_for_the_safe_use_of_otc_products" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To use OTC products safely, it is important to understand (1) their side effects, (2) their effects on other underlying medical conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes mellitus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthma</a>, and other conditions, (3) their interactions with other prescribed medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antidepressants</a>, blood thinners, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">high blood pressure</a> medicines, and (4) the product's limitations.</p>.<p>The following guidelines are provided to help consumers make more informed choices when selecting OTC products:</p>
