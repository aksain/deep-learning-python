the dramatic, rapid appearance of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> 
beginning in childhood. Affected 
children typically look normal at birth and in early infancy, but then grow more 
slowly than other children and do not gain weight at the expected rate (failure 
to thrive). </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_characteristics_signs_and_symptoms_of_hutchinson_gilford_progeria_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>They develop a characteristic facial appearance including:</p>.<p>Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome also causes:</p>.<p>This condition does not disrupt intellectual development or

newborns worldwide. More than 130 cases have been reported in the scientific 
literature since the condition was first described in 1886.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_genes_are_related_to_hutchinson_gilford_progeria_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mutations in the <i>LMNA</i> gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.</p>.<p>The <i>LMNA</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. This 
protein plays an important role in determining the shape of the nucleus within 
cells. It is an essential scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear 
envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus. Mutations that cause 
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal 
version of the lamin A protein. The altered protein makes the nuclear envelope 
unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die 
prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the 
characteristic features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_inherit_hutchinson_gilford_progeria_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant 
condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient 
to cause the disorder. The condition results from new mutations in the <i>LMNA</i> 
gene, and almost always occurs in people with no history of the disorder in 
their family.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_and_prognosis_of_people_with_hutchinson_gilford_progeria_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Experience severe hardening
