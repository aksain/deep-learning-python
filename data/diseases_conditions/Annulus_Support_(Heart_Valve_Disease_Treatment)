The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_minimally_invasive_heart_valve_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>, and length of hospital stay.</p>.<p>Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.</p>.<p>Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a> transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_heart_valve_repair_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mitral valve</a> is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aortic</a>, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. 
The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.</p>.<p>If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.</p>.<p>The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_my_valves_cannot_be_repaired" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When you have aortic or pulmonic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_valve_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart valve disease</a>, valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aortic valve</a> can be repaired.</p>.<p>During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_each_type_of_heart_valve" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_non-surgical_options_for_valve_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aortic_stenosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aortic stenosis</a> (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_balloon_valvotomy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.</p>.<p>During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">echocardiogram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound of the heart</a>) to get a better picture of the valve.</p>.<p>New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
