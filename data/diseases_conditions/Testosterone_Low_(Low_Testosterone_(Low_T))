Several published research articles have conflicting results and more research is needed to make a final determination about the use of testosterone for healthy aging males.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_know_if_you_have_low_testosterone_low-t" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of low-T is based on correlating a low blood level (300 ng/dl or below) with symptoms.</p>.<p>Most of the symptoms are very apparent (see previously), but some need to be further investigated (such as low bone density).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatment_options_for_low_testosterone_low-t" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of low testosterone in hypogonadism is a fully accepted therapy. Treatment in older men is more controversial. Discuss your testosterone levels, symptoms, and side effects of treatment with your doctor to establish whether you should receive therapy and what form of therapy.</p>.<p>There are several ways that testosterone therapy can be administered:</p>.<p>Why no pills? Testosterone is available as a pill but some experts believe long term oral delivery of testosterone can have negative effects on the liver. These other delivery methods bypass the liver (as they don't involve a pill being absorbed through the stomach/intestine) and go directly into the blood stream.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_remedies_treat_low_testosterone_low-t" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_side_effects_of_testosterone_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Possible side effects and risks of testosterone therapy for the normal aging male include:</p>.<p><b><a name="should_i_take_testosterone" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The definite verdict on testosterone therapy is still out. Testosterone therapy is accepted as a treatment for hypogonadism, a clearly defined medical condition.</p>.<p>In older adults who have markedly decreased testosterone levels without significant symptoms or who have modestly decreased levels with significant symptoms, testosterone therapy should be considered after a discussion with your doctor about side effects and possible positive effects of therapy.</p>.<p>There is no clear prove that testosterone therapy is helpful in reversing any aspects of natural aging in males.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
