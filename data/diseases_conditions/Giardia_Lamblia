<p><b><a name="what_is_giardiasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_for_giardiasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Giardiasis occurs where there is inadequate sanitation or inadequate treatment of drinking water. Giardiasis is one of the causes of "travelers <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>" that occurs during travel to less-developed countries, for example the Soviet Union, Mexico, Southeast Asia, and western South America. Giardiasis is a common cause of outbreaks of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> in day-care centers because of the high probability of fecal-oral contamination from children; the children, their families, and day care center workers, all are at risk for infection. In fact, children are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. Hikers exploring back-country areas who drink from contaminated fresh water lakes also are at risk for developing giardiasis. Individuals who practice anal/oral sex also may become infected.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_signs_and_symptoms_does_giardiasis_cause" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common manifestations of giardiasis are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">diarrhea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, particularly cramping; however, diarrhea is not invariable and occurs in 60% to 90% of patients. Other common manifestations include:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Fever</a> is unusual. The severity of the symptoms may vary greatly from mild or no symptoms to severe symptoms. Stools may be foul smelling when the Giardia interferes with the absorption of fat from the intestine (malabsorption). The illness or the malabsorption may cause loss of weight.</p>.<p><strong>Symptoms and signs of giardiasis do not begin for at least seven days following infection</strong>, but can occur as long as three or more weeks later. In most patients the illness is self-limiting and lasts 2-4 weeks. In many patients who are not treated, however, infection can last for several months to years with continuing symptoms. Children with chronic infection may fail to thrive. Some patients recover from their giardiasis, with or without treatment, but symptoms continue, perhaps because of a condition referred to as postinfectious <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">irritable bowel syndrome</a>. The cause of the continuing symptoms is not clear but may be due to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_giardiasis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best single test for diagnosing giardiasis is antigen testing of the stool. For antigen testing, a small sample of stool is tested for the presence of Giardial proteins. The antigen test will identify more than 90% of people infected with Giardia. Giardia also can be diagnosed by examination of stool under the microscope for cysts or trophozoites; however, it takes three samples of stool to diagnose 90% of cases. Despite requiring three samples of stool, microscopic examination of stool identifies other parasites in addition to Giardia that can cause diarrheal illness. Therefore, microscopical examination of stool has value beyond diagnosing giardiasis, as it can identify and diagnose other parasites as the cause of a patient's illness.</p>.<p>Other tests that can be used for diagnosing giardiasis are collection and examination of fluid from the duodenum or biopsy of the small intestine, but these require tests that involve expense and discomfort. The string test is a more comfortable method for obtaining a sample of duodenal fluid. For the string test, a gelatin capsule that contains a loosely-woven string is swallowed. One end of the string protrudes from the capsule and is taped to the patient's outer cheek. Over several hours, the gelatin capsule dissolves in the stomach, and the string uncoils, with the last 12 inches or so passing into the duodenum. In the duodenum the string absorbs a small amount of duodenal fluid. The string then is untapped from the cheek and is removed. The collected duodenal fluid is expressed from the string and is examined under the microscope. Although more comfortable than some of the other tests, it is not clear how sensitive the string test is in diagnosing giardiasis.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_giardiasis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common treatment for giardiasis is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metronidazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">metronidazole</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metronidazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Flagyl</a>) for 5-10 days. It has an efficacy rate of 75% to 100%, but it often causes gastrointestinal side effects such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> and a metallic taste as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dizziness</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>. Despite its effectiveness, metronidazole is not approved by the FDA in the U.S. for treatment of giardiasis.</p>.<p>Tinidazole has replaced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/furazolidone-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">furazolidone</a> as the FDA-approved drug for treatment of the condition, and is highly effective at treating giardiasis (&gt;90%). It also can be given as a single dose and is well tolerated. Furazolidone and Quinacrine are effective for treating giardiasis but are no longer available in the U.S. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/albendazole-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Albendazole</a> and mebendazole are effective alternative agents, but these are not approved for used in the U.S. Paromomyin is less effective than other treatments.</p>.<p>Occasionally, treatment fails to eradicate Giardia. In such cases, the drug may be changed or a longer duration or higher dose may be used. Combination therapy also may be effective (e.g., quinacrine and metronidazole).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_giardiasis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
