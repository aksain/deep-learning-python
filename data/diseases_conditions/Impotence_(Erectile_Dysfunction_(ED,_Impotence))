Erectile dysfunction is different from other health conditions that interfere with male sexual function, such as lack of sexual desire (decreased libido) and problems with ejaculation release of the fluid from the penis (ejaculatory dysfunction) and orgasm/climax (orgasmic dysfunction), and penile curvature (Peyronie's disease), although these problems may also be present. ED affects about 50% of men age 40 and over. This article focuses on the evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_normal_penis_anatomy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The penis contains three cylinders, the two <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_erectile_dysfunction_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">corpora cavernosa</a>, which are on the top of the penis (see figure 1 below). These two cylinders are involved in erections. The third cylinder contains the urethra, the tube that the urine and ejaculate passes through, runs along the underside of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra. Spongy tissue that has muscles, fibrous tissues, veins, and arteries within it makes up the corpora cavernosa. The inside of the corpora cavernosa is like a sponge, with potential spaces that can fill with blood and distend (known as sinusoids). A layer of tissue that is like Saran Wrap, called the tunica albuginea, surrounds the corpora. Veins located just under the tunica albuginea drain blood out of the penis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Erectile dysfunction (ED, impotence) varies in severity; some cannot have an erection at all, whereas other men sometimes have troubles getting a hard erection, and others get a hard erection but it only lasts for a short period of time. Approximately 50% of men over the age of 40 have troubles with erectile dysfunction.</p>.<p>While erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, the risk of developing erectile dysfunction increases with age. According to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 52% in men 40-70 years of age. The prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction increases from 5% at 40 years of age to 15% among men 70 years of age and older.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_erection_occur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Erections are neurovascular events, meaning that nerves and blood vessels (arteries and veins) are involved in the process of an erection and all must work properly to develop a hard erection that lasts long enough. Erection begins with sexual stimulation. Sexual stimulation can be tactile (for example, by a partner touching the penis or by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/masturbation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">masturbation</a>) or mental (for example, by having sexual fantasies, viewing porn). Sexual stimulation or sexual arousal causes the nerves going to the penis to release a chemical, nitric oxide. Nitric oxide increases the production of another chemical, cyclic GMP (cGMP), in the muscle of the corpora cavernosa. The cGMP causes the muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, and this allows more blood to flow into the penis. The incoming blood fills the corpora cavernosa, making the penis expand.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_a_man_sustain_an_erection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As blood flows into the penis, the corpora cavernosa swell, and this swelling compresses the veins (blood vessels that drain the blood out of the penis) against the tunica albuginea. Compression of the veins prevents blood from leaving the penis. This creates a hard erection. When the amount of cGMP decreases by the action of a chemical called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the muscles in the penis tighten, and the blood flow into the penis decreases. With less blood coming into the penis, the veins are not compressed, allowing blood to drain out of the penis, and the erection goes down.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The ability to achieve and sustain erections requires the following:</p>.<p>Erectile dysfunction can occur if a man doesn't meet one or more of these requirements. The following are causes of erectile dysfunction, and many men have more than one potential cause:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_erectile_dysfunction_risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The common risk factors for ED include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_erectile_dysfunction_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of erectile dysfunction may include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Physicians make a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction in men who complain of troubles having a hard enough erection or a hard erection that does not last long enough. It is important as you talk with your doctor that you be candid in terms of when your troubles started, how bothersome your erectile dysfunction is, how severe it is, and discuss all your medical conditions along with all prescribed and nonprescribed medications that you are taking. Your doctor will ask several questions to determine if your symptoms are suggestive of erectile dysfunction and to assess its severity and possible causes. Your doctor will try to get information to answer the following questions:</p>.<p>The physical examination can reveal clues for physical causes of erectile dysfunction. A doctor will perform an assessment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/body_mass_index_bmi/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">BMI</a> and waist circumference to evaluate for abdominal obesity. A genital examination is part of the evaluation of erectile dysfunction. The examination will focus on the penis and testes. The doctor will ask you about penile curvature and will examine the penis to see if there are any plaques (hard areas) palpable. The doctor will examine the testes to make sure they are in the proper location in the scrotum and are normal in size. Small testicles, lack of facial hair, and enlarged breasts (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/gynecomastia_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">gynecomastia</a>) can point to hormonal problems such as hypogonadism with low testosterone levels. A health care provider may check pulses in your groin and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a> to determine if there is a suggestion of hardening of the arteries that could also affect the arteries to the penis.</p>.<p>The lab testing obtained for the evaluation of erectile dysfunction may vary with the information obtained on the health history, physical examination, and recent lab testing. A testosterone level is not necessary in all men; however, a physician will order labs to determine a patient's testosterone level if other signs and symptoms of hypogonadism (low testosterone) such as decreased libido, loss of body hair, muscle loss, breast enlargement, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoporosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">infertility</a>, and decreased penile/testicular size are present.</p>.<p>A doctor may ask for the following laboratory tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction:</p>.<p>Health care professionals do not routinely obtain imaging tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Ultrasound</a> with Doppler imaging (ultrasound plus evaluation of blood flow in the arteries and veins) can provide additional information about blood flow of the penis and may help in the evaluation of patients prior to surgical intervention. This study is typically performed after the injection of a chemical that causes the arteries to open up, a vasodilator (prostaglandin E1), into the corpora cavernosa in order to cause dilation of blood vessels and promote blood flow into the penis. The rate of blood flow into the penis can be measured along with an evaluation of problems with compression of the veins.</p>.<p>Rarely, a doctor may perform an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angiogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">angiogram</a> (injecting a dye into the arteries that supply the penis and taking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> to look for areas of narrowing of the arteries) in cases in which possible vascular surgery could be beneficial.</p>.<p>Monitoring erections that occur during sleep (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria_pnh/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nocturnal</a> penile tumescence) can help you and your doctor to understand if the erectile dysfunction is due to psychological or physical causes. The nocturnal penile tumescence test is a study to evaluate erections at night. Normally men have three to five erections per eight hours of sleep. The test can be performed at home or in a sleep lab. The most accurate way to perform the test involves a special device that is connected to two rings. The rings are placed around the penis, one at the tip of the penis and the other at the bottom (base) of the penis. The device records how many erections occur, how long they last, and how rigid they are. The test is limited in that it does not assess the ability to penetrate.</p>.<p>If there seems to be a psychological cause contributing to your erectile dysfunction, the doctor may ask the patient questions to help determine stressor, events, and relationship issues that may be causing your erectile troubles. It may be helpful to have your sexual partner involved in this assessment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_drugs_treat_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A number of medical treatment options exist for erectile dysfunction include the following:</p>.<p>A doctor can help decide what medication(s) may be the best for the patient. This is an important step to do so the doctor can help choose the best and safest drug(s) and other treatments so that men with other medical problems can get individualized care appropriate for their medical conditions.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following are treatment options for erectile dysfunction:</p>.<p>Many common medications for treating hypertension, depression, and high blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipids</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_hyperlipidemia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high cholesterol</a>) can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see above). Treatment of hypertension is an example. There are many different types (classes) of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">medications for high blood pressure</a>; these include beta-blockers, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcium_channel_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">calcium channel blockers</a>, diuretics (medications that increase urine volume), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ACE inhibitors</a>), and angiotensin receptor blockers (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angiotensin_ii_receptor_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ARBs</a>). Patients may use these medications alone or in combination to control blood pressure. Some of these medications can cause troubles with erections. For example, Inderal (a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta-blocker</a>) and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) cause erectile dysfunction, while calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors do not seem to affect erectile function. On the other hand, other medications (such as angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB] including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/losartan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">losartan</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/losartan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cozaar</a>] and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valsartan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">valsartan</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valsartan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Diovan</a>]) may actually help with erections. Therefore, if possible, you may benefit from changing your medications, but this requires approval by your prescribing health care provider.</p>.<p>Quitting smoking, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, curtailing excessive alcohol consumption, controlling hypertension, and optimizing blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes are not only important for maintaining good health but also may improve or even prevent progression of erectile dysfunction. It is unclear if such lifestyle changes can reverse erectile dysfunction. However, lifestyle improvements may prevent progression of the erectile dysfunction. Some studies suggest that men who have made lifestyle improvements experience increased rates of success with oral medications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_erectile_dysfunction_treatments_for_men_with_cardiovascular_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>ED is often the result of atherosclerosis, and as a result, men with ED frequently have cardiovascular disease. Sexual activity is associated with increased physical exertion, which in some men may increase the risk of having a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myocardial infarction</a> or MI). The major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease are age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipid</a>/cholesterol levels in the blood, and lack of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a>. Individuals with three or more of these risk factors are at increased risk for a heart attack during sexual activity. The Princeton Consensus Panel developed guidelines for treating ED in men with cardiovascular disease. Thus, if you have ED and cardiovascular disease (for example, angina or prior heart attack), you should discuss whether or not treatment of ED and sexual activity are appropriate for you.</p>.<p><b><a name="oral_phosphodiesterase_type_5_pde5_inhibitors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The common PDE5 inhibitor drugs approved in the United States are sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra and Staxyn, the generic form), tadalafil (Cialis), or avanafil (Stendra). All of the currently approved PDE5 inhibitors work in the same way. They differ in the number of available doses, how quickly they work and last in your system, the dosing, and to some extent in the side effects. However, they generally share the same indications and contraindications. Currently, tadalafil is the only medication that patients can take on a daily basis and is approved for the treatment of both ED and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benign_prostatic_hyperplasia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">BPH</a> (benign enlargement of the prostate).</p>.<p>When sexually stimulated there is a release of a chemical, nitric oxide (NO) in the blood vessels of the corpus cavernosum. The NO stimulates the production of a compound called cGMP, which causes relaxation of the smooth muscle in the blood vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum. PDE 5 is an enzyme that breaks down cGMP. By inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP by PDE5, these medications allow cGMP to build up in the penis. cGMP causes muscles in the corpora cavernosa of the penis to relax. When the muscle is relaxed, more blood can flow into the penis and fill the spaces in the penis. As the penis fills with blood, the veins in the penis are compressed, and this results a hard erection. When the effect on PDE5 decreases, the cGMP levels go down and the muscle in the penis contracts, causing less blood to flow into the penis and allowing the veins to open up and drain blood out of the penis.</p>.<p>Some men should not take PDE5 inhibitors. They can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypotension</a> (abnormally <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a> that can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fainting</a> and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shock</a>) when given to patients who are taking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrates-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitrates</a> (medications taken for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>). Therefore, patients taking nitrates daily should not take any of the PDE5 inhibitors. Nitrates relieve angina (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a> due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle because of narrowing of the coronary arteries); these include nitroglycerine tablets, patches, ointments, sprays, and pastes, as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/isosorbide_dinitrate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">isosorbide dinitrate</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/isosorbide_mononitrate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">isosorbide mononitrate</a>. Other nitrates such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate also are in some recreational drugs called "poppers."</p>.<p>If you are taking medications (alpha-blockers) for problems with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benign_prostatic_hyperplasia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enlarged prostate</a>, you should discuss your prostate medications with your doctor. Alpha-blockers also can cause lowering of the blood pressure. Thus your doctor will need to carefully watch your blood pressure when you start the PDE5 inhibitor. Common alpha-blockers include doxazosin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxazosin_mesylate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cardura</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/terazosin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">terazosin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/terazosin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Hytrin</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tamsulosin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tamsulosin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tamsulosin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Flomax</a>).</p>.<p>PDE 5 inhibitors are broken down primarily by enzyme, cytochrome P450enzyme CYP3A4. Medications that decrease or increase the activity of CYP3A4 may affect levels and effectiveness of PDE 5 inhibitors. Such drugs include medications for the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/protease_inhibitors_pi_drug_class/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">protease inhibitors</a>) and the antifungal medications <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketoconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ketoconazole</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itraconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">itraconazole</a>. Thus caution is recommended.</p>.<p>The various PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of ED share several common side effects, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, flushing, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nasal_congestion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nasal congestion</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dyspepsia</a> (stomach discomfort), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>. Differences exist in side effects of the different PDE5 inhibitors, and thus it is important to be familiar with the prescribing information of the PDE5 inhibitor you are prescribed.</p>.<p>There have been rare reports of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/priapism_penis_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">priapism</a> (prolonged and painful erections lasting more than six hours) with the use of PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil.

Untreated priapism can cause injury to the penis and lead to permanent impotence. Therefore, if your erection lasts four hours, you should seek emergency medical care.</p>.<p>Rare side effects of all PDE5 inhibitors include a sudden <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loss of vision</a> in one or both eyes (nonarteritic anterior ischemic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">optic neuropathy</a> [NAION]) and sudden loss of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing</a>.

Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, which is an enzyme that destroys cGMP. By inhibiting the destruction of cGMP by PDE5, sildenafil allows cGMP to accumulate. The cGMP in turn prolongs relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. Relaxation of the corpora cavernosa smooth muscle allows blood to flow into the penis resulting in increased engorgement of the penis. In short, sildenafil increases blood flow into the penis and decreases blood flow out of the penis.</p>.<p>Sildenafil treats erectile dysfunction of either physical or psychological cause. It is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coronary artery disease</a>, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_artery_bypass_graft/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">coronary artery bypass</a> grafting (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_artery_bypass_graft/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CABG</a>), and men who are taking antidepressants and several classes of antihypertensives.</p>.<p>In randomized placebo-controlled trials, an estimated 60% of men with diabetes, and 80% of men without diabetes experienced improved erections with sildenafil.</p>.<p>Sildenafil is available as oral tablets at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. Patients should take sildenafil approximately one hour before sexual activity. In some men, the onset of action of the drug may be as early as 11-20 minutes. It's best for men to take sildenafil on an empty stomach for best results since absorption and effectiveness of sildenafil can be diminished if it is taken shortly after a meal, particularly a meal that is high in fat. Sildenafil and the other PDE5 inhibitors don't cause an immediate erection. Sexual stimulation is necessary for these medications to work.</p>.<p>In prescribing sildenafil, a doctor considers the age, general health status, and other medication(s) the patient is taking. The usual starting dose for most men is 50 mg, however, the doctor may increase or decrease the dose depending on side effects and effectiveness. The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg every 24 hours. However, many men will need 100 mg of sildenafil for optimal effectiveness, and some doctors are recommending 100 mg as the starting dose.</p>.<p>Aging, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> and kidney problems, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erythromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">erythromycin</a> [an antibiotic] and protease inhibitors for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV</a>) slows the metabolism (breakdown) of sildenafil. Slowed breakdown allows sildenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially may increase the risk of side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age, in men with significant kidney and liver disease, and in men who also are taking medications called protease inhibitors, the doctor will initiate sildenafil at a lower dose (25 mg) to avoid accumulation of sildenafil in the body. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/protease_inhibitors_pi_drug_class/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">protease inhibitor</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ritonavir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ritonavir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ritonavir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Norvir</a>) is especially potent in increasing the accumulation of sildenafil, thus men who are taking Norvir should not take sildenafil doses higher than 25 mg and at a frequency of no greater than once in 48 hours. Other medications that may affect the level of sildenafil include erythromycin and ketoconazole.</p>.<p>Sildenafil (Viagra) may affect another phosphodiesterase enzyme in the eye causing transient abnormal vision (seeing a bluish hue or brightness).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="vardenafil_levitra_and_the_generic_formulation_staxyn" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vardenafil (Levitra) was the second oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) inhibits PDE5, which destroys cGMP (as discussed earlier). It is the only PDE 5 inhibitor that has a generic form available.</p>.<p>Vardenafil is effective in men of all ages, different nationalities, and in men with such medical conditions as diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate surgery.</p>.<p>The recommended starting dose of vardenafil is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher or lower depending on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg, and the maximum recommended dosing frequency is no more than once per day.

The devices have three components:</p>.<p>The vacuum device creates a vacuum to pull blood into the penis. Unlike a normal erection, the inflow of blood does not continue once the individual removes the vacuum device. The rubber band placed at the base of the penis constricts the penis to prevent the blood from leaving the penis. As there is no inflow or outflow of blood when the rubber band is in place, it is uncommon for the tip of the penis (the glans) to appear a little blue and the penis to be cooler. Once intercourse is completed, the individual removes the rubber band and the blood drains out of the penis.</p>.<p>Yes, the vacuum device is effective. In fact, with use of the vacuum device, 88% of men will have an erection that is satisfactory for completion of sexual activity. The vacuum device may be the only therapy that is effective after the removal of a penile prosthesis. Patients also use vacuum devices as part of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy to help preserve the tissue of the penis and prevent scarring within the penis and loss of penile length. Its use, however, is limited by the mechanical nature of it and the time taken to pump the device and apply the band. Sex partners may complain of the penis being cool to touch.</p>.<p>Individuals must remove the rubber band immediately after completing intercourse. Leaving the band on too long can harm the penis. Rarely, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a> of the penis or blood in the ejaculate/urine may occur.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_psychological_therapy_for_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Experts often treat psychologically based impotence using techniques that decrease anxiety associated with intercourse. The patient's partner can help apply the techniques, which include gradual development of intimacy and stimulation. Such techniques also can help relieve anxiety during treatment of physical impotence. If these simple behavioral methods at home are ineffective, a doctor may refer an individual to a sex counselor.</p>.<p><b><a name="surgery_for_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery for erectile dysfunction may have the following as its goal:</p>.<p></p>.<p>Currently, there are several different types of penile prostheses. The simplest is the malleable penile prosthesis and the most complex, the three-piece inflatable penile prosthesis.</p>.<p>Malleable implants usually consist of paired rods, inserted surgically into each of the corpora cavernosa. The rods are stiff, and to have an erection, one bends them up and then when finished with intercourse one bends them down. They do not change in length or width. The malleable implants are the least mechanical and thus have the lowest risk of malfunction. However, also have the least "normal appearance."</p>.<p>The most common inflatable prosthesis is the three-piece penile prosthesis. It is composed of paired cylinders, which doctors surgically insert inside the penis. Patients can expand the cylinders using pressurized fluid (see figure 3). Tubes connect the cylinders to a fluid reservoir and pump, which doctors also surgically implant. The reservoir is usually in the pelvis. A doctor places the pump in the scrotum. By pressing on the pump, sterile fluid transfers from the reservoir into the cylinders in the penis. An erection is produced primarily by expansion of the width of the penis, however, one model can increase in length a small amount also. Lock-out valves in the tubing prevent the fluid from leaving the cylinder until a release valve is pressed. By pressing the relief valve and gently squeezing the penis, the fluid within the cylinders transfers back into the reservoir.</p>.<p>The surgery for placement of a penile prosthesis is typically an outpatient surgery. Doctors often perform a penile prosthesis through a single incision, and all of the components are hidden under the skin. Health care professionals often give patients antibiotics at the time of surgery and often after the surgery to decrease the risk of developing an infection. Depending on your health history, a health care provider may leave a catheter in your penis to drain your bladder overnight.</p>.<p>Penile prostheses are very effective, and most patients who have a prosthesis placed are satisfied with the prosthesis. However, placement of a prosthesis causes scarring of the tissue within the corpora cavernosa, and if the prosthesis requires removal, other forms of therapy, except for the vacuum device, are often not effective. Thus, most physicians reserve placement of a prosthesis for men who have tried and failed or have contraindications to other therapies.</p>.<p>Infection is a concern after placement of a prosthesis and is a reported complication in 8%-20% of men undergoing placement of a penile prosthesis. If a prosthesis becomes infected (redness, pain, and swelling of the penis and sometimes purulent drainage are signs of infection), the prosthesis must be removed. Depending on the timing and severity of the infection and your surgeon's preference, the area can be irrigated extensively with antibiotic solutions and a new prosthesis placed at the same time or removal of the infected prosthesis and an attempt to place a new prosthesis made at a later time when the infection is totally cleared.</p>.<p>Mechanical malfunction is another risk of the prosthesis. However, advancements including lock-out valves and special covering over areas of the tubing have decreased the risk of mechanical malfunction.</p>.<p>Erosion of the prosthesis, whereby it presses through the corporal tissue into the urethra, may occur. Symptoms and signs may include pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_urine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood in the urine</a>, discharge, abnormal urine stream, and malfunction. If the prosthesis erodes into the urethra, a physician must remove it. If the other cylinder remains intact, it can be left in place. A physician leaves a catheter in place to allow the urethra to heal.</p>.<p>Other risks of penile prosthesis include over- or undersizing of the prosthesis, which can cause an abnormal appearance to the erect penis or reservoir or pump migration into abnormal locations.</p>.<p>Surgery to repair arteries (penile arterial reconstructive surgery) can reduce impotence caused by obstructions that block the flow of blood to the penis. The best candidates for such surgery are young men with discrete blockage of an artery because of a physical injury to the pubic area or a fracture of the pelvis. The procedure is less successful in older men with widespread blockage of arteries.</p>.<p>Physicians do not recommend surgery on the penile veins.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_over-the-counter_otc_and/or_natural_or_home_remedies_treat_erectile_dysfunction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has a list of 29 OTC products that claim to treat erectile dysfunction.
