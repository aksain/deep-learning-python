It is important to know the body's anatomy and function to understand why clots form in veins and why they can be dangerous.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_a_blood_clot_in_the_leg_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_dvt" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Blood is meant to flow. If it becomes stagnant, there is a potential for it to clot. The blood in veins constantly forms microscopic clots that are routinely broken down by the body. If the balance of clot formation and clot breakdown is altered, significant clotting may occur. A thrombus can form if one or a combination of the following situations.</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_dvt" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The signs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_dvt_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of DVT</a> are related to obstruction of blood returning to the heart and causing a backup of blood in the leg. Classic symptoms include:</p>.<p>You may or may not have all of these symptoms, or your may have none. The symptoms of the condition may mimic an infection or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cellulitis</a> of the arm or leg.</p>.<p>In the past doctors and other health care professionals perform simple tests on patients to make a diagnosis of a blood clot in the leg; however, they have not been effective. For example, pulling the patient's toes toward the nose (Homans' sign), and squeezing the calf to produce pain (Pratt's sign). Today, doctors and health care professionals usually do not rely upon whether these signs and symptoms are present to make the diagnosis or decide that you have DVT.</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_superficial_blood_clots" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Blood clots in the superficial vein system (closer to the surface of the skin), most often occur due to trauma to the vein, which causes a small blood clot to form. Inflammation of the vein and surrounding skin causes the symptoms similar to any other type of inflammation, for example,</p>.<p>You often can feel the vein as a firm, thickened cord. There may be inflammation that follows the course of part of the leg vein. Although there is inflammation, there is no infection.</p>.<p><strong>Varicosities </strong>can predispose to superficial thrombophlebitis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/varicose_veins/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">varicose veins</a>. This occurs when the valves of the larger veins in the superficial system fail (the greater and lesser saphenous veins), which allows blood to back up and cause the veins to swell and become distorted or tortuous. The valves fail when veins lose their elasticity and stretch. This can be due to age, prolonged standing, obesity, pregnancy, and genetic factors.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a wide variety of people who are at risk for developing blood clots. Some risk factors include:</p>.<p><b><a name="which_types_of_doctors_treat_dvt" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with a swollen extremity or concern that a DVT exists may be cared for by a variety of health-care professionals. Both the primary care provider (including internal medicine and family medicine specialists) and a health care professional at in an urgent care (walk in) clinic or emergency department are able to recognize and diagnose the condition. Some people go to the hospital and the diagnosis is made there.</p>.<p>Treatment is usually started by the doctor who makes the diagnosis, but long-term treatment decisions, risk stratification, and follow-up usually is be done by the person's primary care doctor. Depending upon the situation, a hematologist (specialist in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">blood disorders</a>) may be consulted. If there is need for the clot to be removed or dissolved, an interventional radiologist may also be involved.</p>.<p>Depending upon the medication used to anticoagulate the blood, pharmacists and anticoagulation nurses may also be involved on your treatment team.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_the_condition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of <b>superficial</b> thrombophlebitis usually is made by the doctor at the bedside of the patient, based upon history, potential risk factors present, and findings from the physical examination. Further risk stratification tools may include scoring systems that can help decide whether a DVT is likely.</p>.<p>If the probability of a leg thrombosis is low, a D-dimer blood test may be ordered.</p>.<p>D-dimer is a blood test that may be used as a screening test to determine if a blood clot exists. D-dimer is a chemical that is produced when a blood clot in the body gradually dissolves. The test is used as a positive or negative indicator. If the result is negative, then in most cases no blood clot exists. If the D-dimer test is positive, it does not necessarily mean that a deep vein thrombosis is present since many situations will have an expected positive result. Any bruise or blood clot will result in a positive D-dimer result (for example, from surgery, a fall, in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a> or in pregnancy). For that reason, D-dimer testing must be used selectively.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatment_guidelines_for_dvt" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for deep venous thrombosis is anticoagulation or "thinning the blood" with medications.</p>.<p>The recommended length of treatment for an uncomplicated DVT is three months. Depending upon the patient's situation, underlying medical conditions and the reason for developing a blood clot, a longer duration of anticoagulation may be required. At three months, the doctor or other health care professional should evaluate the patient in regard to the potential for future blood clot formation. If the decision is made to continue anticoagulation over the long term, the risk/reward decision of preventing clots versus bleeding risk should occur every year to decide if anticoagulation is still a reasonable treatment.</p>.<p>There are times when anticoagulation may have increased bleeding risk, for example, if the patient has had recent major surgery (anticoagulation thins all of the blood in the body not just the DVT). Other bleeding risks occur in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver disease</a> and those who take medications that can interact with the anticoagulation medicines.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_of_superficial_blood_clots" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis treating the symptoms with:</p>.<p>If the thrombophlebitis occurs near the groin where the superficial and deep systems join together, there is potential that the thrombus could extend into the deep venous system. These patients may require anticoagulation or blood thinning therapy.</p>.<p><b><a name="medications_to_treat_blood_clots_in_the_leg" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anticoagulation prevents further growth of the blood clot and prevents it from forming an embolus that can travel to the lung. The body has a complex mechanism to form blood clots to help repair blood vessel damage. There is a clotting cascade with numerous blood factors that have to be activated for a clot to form. There are difference types of medications that can be used for anticoagulation to treat DVT:</p>.<p>The American College of Chest Physicians has guidelines that give direction as to what medications might best be used in different situations. For example, a patient with a DVT, and no active cancer, treatment with a NOAC would be recommended. If active cancer exists, the treatment of DVT would be with enoxaparin as the drug of first choice.</p>.<p>NOACs work almost immediately to thin the blood and anticoagulate the patient. There is no need for blood tests to monitor dosing. The NOAC medications presently approved for deep vein thrombosis treatment include:</p>.<p>All four are also indicated to treat pulmonary embolism. They also may be prescribed to patients anticoagulated with nonvalvular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_fibrillation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atrial fibrillation</a> to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a> and systemic embolus.</p>.<p><b><a name="warfarin_coumadin_jantoven" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Warfarin (Coumadin, Janotven) is an anti-coagulation medication that acts as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_k-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Vitamin K</a> antagonist, blocking blood clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Historically, it was a first-line medication for treating blood clots, but its role has been diminished because of the availability of newer <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>. While warfarin may be prescribed immediately after the diagnosis of DVT, it takes up to a week or more for it to reach therapeutic levels in the blood so that the blood is appropriately thinned. Therefore, low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin [Lovenox)] is administered at the same time. Enoxaparin thins the blood almost immediately and is used as a bridge therapy until the warfarin has taken effect. Enoxaparin injections can be given on an outpatient basis. For those patients who have contraindications to the use of enoxaparin (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a> does not allow the drug to be appropriately metabolized), intravenous heparin can be used as the first step in association with warfarin. This requires admission to the hospital. The dosage of warfarin is monitored by blood tests measuring the prothrombin time (PT), or INR (international normalized ratio).</p>.<p><b><a name="side_effects_and_risks_of_anticoagulation_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients who take anticoagulation medications are at risk for bleeding. The decision to use these medications must balance the risk and rewards of the treatment. Should bleeding occur, there are strategies available to reverse the anticoagulation effects.</p>.<p>Some patients may have contraindications to anticoagulation therapy, for example a patient with bleeding in the brain, major trauma, or recent significant surgery. An alternative may be to place a filter in the inferior vena cava (the major vein that collects blood from both legs) to prevent emboli, should they arise, from reaching the heart and lungs. These filters may be effective but have the potential risk of being the source of new clot formation. An IVC filter is NOT recommended for patients who are also taking anticoagulation medications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="does_dvt_require_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery is a rare option in treating large deep venous thrombosis of the leg in patients who cannot take blood thinners or who have developed recurrent blood clots while on anti-coagulant medications. The surgery is usually accompanied by placing an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter to prevent future clots from embolizing to the lung.</p>.<p>Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens describes a situation in which a blood clot forms in the iliac vein of the pelvis and the femoral vein of the leg, obstructing almost all blood return and compromising blood supply to the leg. In this case surgery may be considered to remove the clot, but the patient will also require anti-coagulant medications. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Stents</a> may also be required to keep a vein open and prevent clotting. May Thurner Syndrome, also known as iliac vein compression syndrome, is a cause of phlegmasia, in which the iliac vein in the pelvis is compressed and a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">stent</a> is also needed.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pulmonary embolism is the major complication of deep vein thrombosis.
