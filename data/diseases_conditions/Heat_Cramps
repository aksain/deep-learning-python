<p><b><a name="heat_cramps_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_heat_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat cramps are the intermittent, involuntary spasm of muscles that occur in an individual who is physically active (for example, working or exercising) in hot or humid weather. They are often associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a>. Heat cramps usually affect the major muscles that are being stressed in the hot environment. Usually these are the thigh and leg (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/leg_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">quadriceps</a>, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius), the core muscles (abdominal wall and back) and the arm muscles (biceps, triceps).</p>.<p>Heat cramps can also occur after the activity has been completed. For example, construction workers or roofers can develop cramps a few hours after their work shift is over.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_for_heat_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While heat cramps tend to affect those who are active in a hot environment, it should be noted that heat cramps are one of the symptoms associated with heat exhaustion as part of the spectrum of heat-related illness. Those individuals who have impaired temperature control mechanisms are at higher risk for developing heat-related illness. The body's most effective way of cooling itself is through sweat, and then the sweat evaporates into the environment. Those at most risk for heat cramps include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_heat_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While it was thought that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolyte</a> imbalance was the cause of muscle cramping, there are alternative theories as to why muscles cramp when the body is exposed to heat.</p>.<p>Some research suggests that as the muscles tire from excess activity or work, the ability for the muscle to regulate its own contraction is lost, and this is called altered neuromuscular control. Regardless of the cause, the diagnosis and treatment for heat cramps remain the same.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_heat_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat cramps are the earliest symptoms of the spectrum of heat-related illness.</p>.<p><b><i>Do individuals with heat cramps tend only to have muscle cramps?</i></b> If an individual has other signs or symptoms such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lightheadedness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a> he or she may be suffering from heat exhaustion.

The affected individual should stop all activity and find a cool place to rest. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">muscle cramps</a> and spasms can be overcome by gently stretching the cramped muscle(s). Individuals can often replace their fluid loss by drinking a combination of water, sports <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">drinks</a>, or other electrolyte replacement solutions.</p>.<p>If the cramps cannot be controlled, the affected individual should seek medical care. There is no specific condition that differentiates heat cramps from heat exhaustion. The symptoms of these conditions form a spectrum from mild to moderate heat-related illness and symptoms can overlap. Severe heat cramps may actually be heat exhaustion. This is especially true if the person has <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a> and cannot replace the fluid loss, if they have significant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a> and weakness, or if they have profuse sweating that does not stop when placed in a cooler environment.</p>.<p><b>Heat stroke is a true medical emergency and can be deadly.</b> The body's ability to cool itself no longer functions, and as the temperature spikes, sometimes greater than 106 F (41 C), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">confusion</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coma</a> can occur. Emergency medical services should be activated (call 911) immediately if an individual is thought to have heat stroke. While waiting for help to arrive, the person should be moved to a cool place, clothes should be removed to help air circulate over the body, and cool water should be sprayed or sponged onto the body to attempt to cool it.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Prevention</a> is the key to avoiding heat cramps, or other heat-related illness. A person who has had heat cramps is more prone to developing them again. Some professions are at higher risk for heat cramps, for example, construction workers and roofers are potentially exposed not only to the heat from the sun but also from the radiant heat from the hot <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shingles</a> and liners on the roof. It may be helpful to acclimate to the hot environment over a period of days to allow the body and its muscles to adapt to its water and electrolyte needs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_heat_cramps_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of heat cramps is usually made after taking the patient's history. It is important to know about the environment where the person affected by heat cramps was working, exercising, etc...</p>.<p>Often the physical examination will be relatively normal. The cramped muscles may be sore to touch and if there hasn't been adequate fluid replacement, the muscle may cramp again when taken through its normal range of motion. The physical exam may find signs of dehydration such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a> and tongue, lack of sweat in the armpits and groin, and decreased urine output.
