Cunha, DO, FACOEP</a></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_shigellosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Shigellosis is a diarrheal disease caused by a group of bacteria called <i>Shigella</i>. <i>Shigella</i> causes about 500,000 cases of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">diarrhea</a> in the United States annually. There are four different species of <i>Shigella</i>:</p>.<p><i>S. dysenteriae</i> and <i>S. boydii</i> are rare in the United States, though they continue to be important causes of disease in the developing world. <i>Shigella dysenteriae</i> type 1 can cause deadly epidemics.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_shigella" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of shigellosis typically start 1-2 days after exposure and include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_after_infection_do_symptoms_appear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of shigellosis generally begin 1 to 2 days after becoming infected with the bacteria.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_will_symptoms_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In persons with healthy immune systems, symptoms usually last about 5 to 7 days. Persons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. Once someone has had shigellosis, they are not likely to get infected with that specific type again for at least several years. However, they can still get infected with other types of <i>Shigella</i>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_there_be_any_complications_from_shigella_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Possible complications from <i>Shigella</i> infections include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_shigella_infections_be_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many different kinds of germs can cause diarrhea, so establishing the cause will help guide treatment. Healthcare providers can order laboratory tests to identify <i>Shigella</i> in the stools of an infected person. The laboratory can also do special tests to determine which antibiotics, if any, would be best to treat the infection.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_shigella_infections_be_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diarrhea caused by <i>Shigella</i> usually resolves without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. Bismuth subsalicylate (e.g., Pepto-Bismol) may be helpful, but medications that cause the gut to slow down, such as loperamide (e.g., Imodium) or diphenoxylate with atropine (e.g., Lomotil), should be avoided. Antibiotics are useful for severe cases of shigellosis because they can reduce the duration of symptoms. However, <i>Shigella</i> is often resistant to antibiotics. If you require antibiotic treatment for shigellosis, your healthcare provider can culture your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a> and determine which antibiotics are likely to work. Tell your healthcare provider if you do not get better within a couple of days after starting antibiotics. He or she can do additional tests to learn whether your strain of <i>Shigella</i> is resistant to the antibiotic you are taking.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_antibiotic_resistance_a_problem_with_shigella" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In 2013, CDC declared antibiotic-resistant <i>Shigella</i> an urgent threat in the United States. Resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics like ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common among <i>Shigella</i> globally, and resistance to some other important antibiotics is increasing. While <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">travelers</a> to the developing world are at particular risk of acquiring antibiotic-resistant shigellosis, outbreaks of shigellosis resistant to ciprofloxacin or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azithromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">azithromycin</a> -- the two antibiotics most commonly used to treat shigellosis -- have been reported recently within the United States and other industrialized countries. About 27,000 <i>Shigella</i> infections in the United States every year are resistant to one or both of these antibiotics. When pathogens are resistant to common antibiotic medications, patients may need to be treated with medications that may be less effective, but more toxic and expensive.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_will_i_know_if_i_have_an_antibiotic-resistant_shigella_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Shigella</i> infections are diagnosed through laboratory testing of stool specimens (feces). Healthcare providers can order tests to check which antibiotics are likely to help treat a particular patient's infection. If you were treated with antibiotics for shigellosis but do not feel better within a couple of days, tell your healthcare provider. You may need additional tests to check whether your <i>Shigella</i> strain is resistant to the antibiotics.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_i_have_an_antibiotic-resistant_shigella_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Please follow the advice of your healthcare provider. If you do not feel better within a couple of days after beginning treatments, tell your healthcare provider. Protect others by washing your hands carefully with soap after using the toilet, and wait until your diarrhea has stopped before preparing food for others, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swimming/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">swimming</a>, or having sex.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_we_reduce_the_spread_of_antibiotic-resistant_shigella" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant <i>Shigella</i> requires a multi-pronged approach: preventing infections, tracking resistance, improving antibiotic use, and developing new treatments.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_shigella_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Shigella</i> germs are present in the stools of infected persons while they have diarrhea and for up to a week or two after the diarrhea has gone away. <i>Shigella</i> is very contagious; exposure to even a tiny amount of contaminated fecal matter -- too small to see-- can cause infection. Transmission of <i>Shigella</i> occurs when people put something in their mouths or swallow something that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with <i>Shigella</i>. This can happen when:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_reduce_my_risk_of_getting_shigellosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent shigellosis.

It is critical to practice good hand-washing after changing diapers, after using the toilet, and before preparing or eating food to prevent the spread of these and many other infections.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_else_can_be_done_to_prevent_shigellosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_if_an_outbreak_of_shigella_occurs_in_the_childcare_setting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="people_at_risk" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="incidence" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In 2013, the average annual incidence of shigellosis in the United States was 4.82 cases per 100,000 individuals.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
