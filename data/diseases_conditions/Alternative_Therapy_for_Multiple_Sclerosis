(integrative medicine) to 
or instead of traditional or standard medical practices. This group of therapies 
is wide-ranging, and includes:</p>.<p>Some people who seek out alternative medicine feel that conventional therapy has 
not successfully controlled their symptoms, or that the potential side effects 
associated with traditional therapy aren't acceptable. Others find that adding 
complementary medicine to their program allows improved control of symptoms. 
<i>When complementary medicine is added to traditional routes, it is referred to as 
integrative medicine.</i></p>.<p>Recent studies through the US Centers for Disease Control and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prevention</a> 
(CDC), specifically the National Health Interview Survey, suggest that as many 
as 38% of residents within the United States seek out CAM.</p>.<p>Many therapies that are considered within the group of complementary and 
alternative medicines haven't been studied extensively or investigated in 
comparison to conventional treatment options.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_of_multiple_sclerosis_ms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Multiple sclerosis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MS</a>) is a disease that causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">demyelination</a> of the brain
