<p><b><a name="superior_vena_cava_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_superior_vena_cava_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The superior vena cava is a large vein located in the upper chest, which collects blood from the head and arms and delivers it back to the right <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atrium</a> of the heart. If this vein is compressed by outside structures, or if a thrombus or clot develops within it, return blood flow to the heart is impeded. When blood flow to the heart is restricted, the increased pressure in the veins of the face and arms causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a> (fluid buildup) in these areas. This condition is referred to as superior vena cava syndrome.</p>.<p>Because the superior vena cava, like all veins, has a thin wall (there are no muscles in the walls of a vein as compared to the walls of an artery), and because there is little pressure inside the vein, it can be easily compressed by outside structures. The superior vena cava lies next to the upper lobe of the right lung and within the mediastinum [the space that contains the central structures of the chest: the heart, the trachea, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> and the great vessels (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/aorta_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">aorta</a>, vena cava)]. Abnormalities within any of these structures can cause the compression.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_superior_vena_cava_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common cause of superior vena cava syndrome is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>. Primary or metastatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> in the upper lobe of the right lung can compress the superior vena cava. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lymphoma</a> or other tumors located in the mediastinum can also cause compression of the superior vena cava.</p>.<p>Less often, the superior vena cava can become blocked with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clot</a> from within. As more invasive medical procedures are being performed on patients, this cause of superior vena cava syndrome is being seen more frequently. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_clot_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Blood clot</a> (thrombus) formation that causes superior vena cava syndrome is a complication of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pacemaker/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pacemaker</a> wires,<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dialysis</a>, and other intravenous catheters that are threaded into the superior vena cava.</p>.<p>Historically, and in other parts of the world, infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/syphilis_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">syphilis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tuberculosis</a>) is another cause of superior vena cava syndrome. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sarcoidosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sarcoidosis</a> (a disease that results in masses of inflamed tissue) may also cause this syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_superior_vena_cava_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Initially, there are few symptoms, however, over time, symptoms of superior vena cava gradually develop. As the compression becomes more severe, the patient may develop shortness of breath and swelling of the arms and face. The symptoms occur because blood cannot return to the heart. </p>.<p>Without adequate blood return, it is hard for the heart to pump newly oxygenated blood to meet the metabolic needs of the body. If blood cannot return to the heart, it starts to back up and causes swelling of the areas where the backup occurs.</p>.<p>Less common symptoms include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_superior_vena_cava_syndrome_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_superior_vena_cava_syndrome_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rarely does superior vena cava syndrome constitute a medical emergency.

With less pressure pushing against the obstructed superior vena cava, symptoms may be temporarily relieved.</p>.<p>Treatment needs to be directed to the underlying cause. </p>.<p>If the cause is a tumor or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, the treatment plan will need to be customized to the patient's condition and desires.
