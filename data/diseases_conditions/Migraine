<p><b><a name="migraine_headache_definition_meaning_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_migraine_headache" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although the term "migraine" is often used to describe any severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">headache</a>, a migraine headache is the result of specific physiologic changes that occur within the brain, and lead to the characteristic pain and associated symptoms of a migraine.</p>.<p>Migraines usually are associated with sensitivity to sound, light, and smells. This may be accompanied by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a>. This type of headache often involves only one side of the head, but in some cases, patients may have pain bilaterally or on both sides. The pain is often described as throbbing or pounding and it may be made worse with physical exertion.</p>.<p>Not all headaches represent migraines, and migraine is not the only condition that can cause severe and debilitating headaches. For example, cluster headaches are very severe headaches that affect one side of the head in a recurrent manner (occurring in a "cluster" over time). The pain is sometimes described as "drilling," and can be worse than migraine pain in some cases. Cluster headaches are less common than migraine.</p>.<p>Tension headaches are a more common cause of headache. These occur due to contraction of the muscles of the scalp, face, and neck.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_migraine_with_aura" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In some cases, people with migraines have specific warning symptoms, or an aura, prior to the onset of their headache. These warning signs can range from flashing lights or a blind spot in one eye to numbness or weakness involving one side of the body. The aura may last for several minutes, and then resolves as the head pain begins or may last until the headache resolves. For patients who have never had an aura, it can be frightening and can mimic the symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">stroke</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_migraine_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of migraine</a> are:</p>.<p>The International Headache Society defines <b>episodic migraine</b> as being unilateral (meaning on one side of the head), pulsing discomfort of moderate-to-severe intensity, which is aggravated by physical activity and associated with nausea and/or vomiting as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/photophobia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">photophobia</a> and/or phonophobia (sensitivity to light and sound).</p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tension_headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tension headache</a> is described as being bilateral and the pain is not pulsating, but feels like pressure or tightness. While severity can be mild-to-moderate, the headache is not disabling and there is no worsening of the pain with routine physical activity; additionally, there is no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.</p>.<p>A migraine headache typically lasts for several hours up to several days.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_migraine_headaches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The specific cause of migraines is not known, but there may be fluctuations in certain neurotransmitters, chemicals that send messages between brain cells.

In all cases of migraine, the use of acute pain therapies must be watched closely so that a patient does not develop medication overuse headache.</p>.<p>Overuse of many of the medications used to treat migraine headache can lead to increased headache frequency, or even daily headaches. This type of headache phenomenon is known as medication overuse headache.</p>.<p>If an individual experiences frequent headaches, or if the headaches routinely last for several days, then preventive medications may be indicated. These may be prescribed on a daily basis in an effort to decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headaches.
