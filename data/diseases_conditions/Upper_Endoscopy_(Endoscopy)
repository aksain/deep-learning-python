<p><b><a name="what_is_upper_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a 
gastroenterologist) to examine the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a> (swallowing tube), stomach, and 
duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the 
upper endoscope through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_prepare_for_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.</p>.<p>Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications 
being taken, any <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a>, and all known health problems. This information will 
help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, 
and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a>. 
The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy. </p>.<p>Knowledge whether the patient has any major health problems, such as heart or lung diseases, will alert the 
doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="why_have_you_been_scheduled_for_an_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, 
difficulty in swallowing, 
or intestinal bleeding <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a>. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than X-ray for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-ray is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether 
any abnormality is benign or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">malignant</a> (cancerous). </p>.<p><b>Biopsies are taken for many reasons and may not mean that cancer is suspected.</b> Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as 
stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, 
Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, 
retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_i_expect_during_the_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before the procedure the doctor will discuss with the patient why the 
procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and 
what possible complications may result from the endoscopy. Practices vary 
amongst physicians but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing 
solution and will probably be given a sedating and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> alleviating medication 
through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication (usually 
midazolam 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/midazolam-oral_syrup/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Versed</a>) for sedation and 
fentanyl for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> relief) and you may even go to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. This form of sedation is called 
<b>conscious sedation</b> and is usually 
administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure. You may 
also be sedated using propofol, called "deep sedation," usually administered by 
a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vitals during the 
procedure. After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible 
video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a>.  Most patients experience only minimal discomfort during the test and many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> throughout the entire procedure 
using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort 
during the entire procedure.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_after_the_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After the test the patient will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy or a recovery area until a significant portion of the medication has worn off. Occasionally a patient is left with a mild <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>, which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient. When fully recovered, 
the patient will be instructed when to resume their usual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> (probably within 
a few hours) and the patient's driver will be allowed to take the patient home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that the patient be taken by a driver and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_do_i_get_the_results_of_the_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_of_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or sedatives used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a>, bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_there_are_still_remaining_questions_about_endoscopy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If the patient has any questions about their need for this exam, the cost of this procedure and whether it is covered by the patient's insurance, methods of billing, or any concerns about this exam, speak to the doctor or his staff about them. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
