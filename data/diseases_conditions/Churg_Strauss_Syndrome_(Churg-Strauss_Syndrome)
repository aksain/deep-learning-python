<p><b><a name="churg-strauss_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_churg-strauss_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome is one of many forms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vasculitis</a>. Vasculitis diseases are characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. Churg-Strauss syndrome, in particular, occurs in patients with a history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">asthma</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergy</a> and features inflammation of blood vessels (also referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angiitis</a>) in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>, skin, nerves, and abdomen. The blood vessels involved in Churg-Strauss syndrome are small arteries and veins. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_churg-strauss_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome is rare. The cause of the syndrome is not known, but it involves an abnormal over-activation of the immune system in a person with underlying bronchospastic lung disease (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">asthma</a>). While Churg-Strauss syndrome has been reported to be associated with certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_medications/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">asthma medications</a>, called leukotriene modifiers, whether they actually cause the disease or whether the patients that take them have more severe asthma that lends a tendency toward the development of Churg-Strauss is not yet clear. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_of_churg-strauss_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>, and sinus or nasal passage inflammation in the patient with asthma. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fatigue</a> is common. Sometimes the asthma actually improves somewhat as the disease intensifies elsewhere. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cough</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a> can occur as the lungs are affected by vasculitis.</p>.<p>Skin lumps, called nodules, can appear on the extremities. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diarrhea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> in the belly occur due to blood vessel inflammation within the abdomen. The bladder and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostate gland</a> can become inflamed.</p>.<p>Numbness or weakness of the extremities is the result of nerve injury from the vasculitis.

Kidney function blood tests and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinalysis/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinalysis</a> can be abnormal when the kidneys are affected (which is not common).</p>.<p>If the lungs are inflamed, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest x-ray</a> image or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a> of the chest can demonstrate areas of inflammation.</p>.<p>The ultimate test for the diagnosis is a biopsy of involved tissue, which demonstrates a characteristic pattern of inflammation visible under a microscope.  Eosinophil are also seen accumulated in the abnormal tissue.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_churg-strauss_syndrome_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome is directed toward both immediately quieting the inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) and suppressing the immune system. Treatment usually includes high doses of cortisone-related medication (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisone</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisolone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisolone</a>) to calm the inflammation and suppression of the active immune system with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclophosphamide/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclophosphamide/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cytoxan</a>).</p>.<p>Traditionally, cyclophosphamide has been given for a year or more in patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome. In a research study, Churg-Strauss syndrome patients did equally well if treated with cyclophosphamide for 6 or for 12 months. This study suggests that doctors might now be able to recommend a shorter (and, therefore, less toxic) course of Cytoxan for patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_outlook_prognosis_for_patients_with_churg-strauss_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome is a serious disease that can be fatal. Untreated it is extremely dangerous and threatens the organs that are affected.  With aggressive treatment and monitoring it can be quieted and total inactivation of the disease (remission) is possible.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
