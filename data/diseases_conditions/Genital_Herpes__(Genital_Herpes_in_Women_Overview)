<p><b><a name="genital_herpes_in_women_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by an infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of herpes simplex virus.</p>.<p>However, both types of herpes simplex virus can infect the mouth or the genital areas, meaning that genital contact with a cold sore on the mouth can lead to genital herpes. Likewise, kissing someone with a cold sore can spread the herpes simplex virus infection.</p>.<p>After the initial outbreak of herpes, the virus travels through the nerves and resides in nerve tissue within the body. Reactivations, or repeat occurrences of the blisters, can occur throughout an individual's lifetime. Among people aged 14 to 49, an estimated 1 out of every 6 people have the infection.</p>.<p>Genital herpes is not the same thing as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genital_warts_in_women/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genital warts</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Genital warts</a> are flesh-colored growths that appear on the sexually exposed areas due to infection with certain types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">human papillomavirus</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HPV</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_early_signs_and_symptoms_of_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many people infected with genital herpes have mild symptoms or symptoms that are mistaken for another condition. It also is possible to be infected with the virus and have no symptoms. Not every woman who is infected may be aware of the infection.</p>.<p>When signs and symptoms are present, they consist of:</p>.<p>With the first outbreak of genital herpes, a person may also experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">flu-like symptoms</a> including:</p>.<p>Immediately prior to an outbreak, there may be an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a>, burning, or tingling sensation of the skin.</p>.<p>In women, genital herpes usually causes blistering lesions on the vulva and around the vaginal opening that progress to ulcer formation. The infection spreads to involve the cervix in most cases, leading to cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix). In some women, cervicitis may be the only sign of genital herpes infection. Infection and inflammation of the urethra accompanies the infection in some women, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> on urination.</p>.<p>After the initial infection, a person may or may not have outbreaks later in life.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_genital_herpes_how_is_it_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The herpes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a> enter the skin or mucous membrane through tiny, even microscopic, breaks in the tissue when there is contact with an infected person. Because an infected person may spread the disease even when he or she does not have signs or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/herpes_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of herpes</a>, avoiding sexual contact with someone with active blisters does not guarantee protection against the infection. Even normal appearing skin can spread the infection. Clothing that touches genital skin ulcers may transmit herpes simplex virus to others that wear the clothing.</p>.<p>The average incubation period (time until symptoms develop) after exposure is 4 days, but symptoms may develop anywhere from 2 to 12 days after you have been exposed to the virus.</p>.<p>Individual outbreaks of herpes vary among affected people in terms of their frequency and severity. Outbreaks can be related to the function of the immune system and are typically worse in cases in which the immune system is suppressed. For example, at times of physical oremotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>, during illness, or when taking certain medications, genital herpes outbreaks may be more likely.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_get_genital_herpes_transmission" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_cure_for_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no cure for genital herpes, and once a person is infected with genital herpes, the infection persists throughout the individual's life, with the potential for recurrent outbreaks. However, there are medications that can reduce the severity and frequency of outbreaks and treatments to manage the symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_genital_herpes_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most cases in which the characteristic signs and symptoms are present, they are sufficient to establish a diagnosis of genital herpes infection. Laboratory tests, such as viral culture and nucleic acid amplification (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">polymerase chain reaction</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a>) tests to detect the genetic material of the virus, are also available.</p>.<p>Immunologic tests to identify antibodies to genital herpes are other possible tests to establish whether infection has occurred.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_treat_and_manage_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Antiviral medications are available that can help manage the severity and duration of outbreaks, if taken immediately prior to (when there are tingling or unusual skin sensations but no blisters) or within 24 hours of an outbreak. The medications typically used are</p>.<p>These are all typically taken by mouth. In severe cases of viral infection, antiviral medications may be given intravenously, but this is not usually needed for genital herpes. Topical medications that are applied directly to the sores are also available, but these are less effective than oral medications and are not generally used.</p>.<p>All of these medications may also be given daily as suppressive therapy to decrease the number of outbreaks in people who have frequent outbreaks (more than six outbreaks per year).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_genital_herpes_managed_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Oral antiviral medications as described above may be used during pregnancy. One serious concern with genital herpes in pregnancy is transmission of the infection to the baby during delivery. In an infant, genital herpes infection can spread through the bloodstream and have serious consequences. Cesarean delivery (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/c-section_cesarean_birth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">C-section</a>) is performed for women who go into <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/early_signs_and_symptoms_of_labor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">labor</a> while there is an active outbreak of genital herpes in order to prevent infection of the baby during birth.</p>.<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes be offered oral antiviral medication at or beyond 36 weeks until delivery in order to increase the chances of being able to deliver vaginally.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_home_remedies_or_natural_treatments_effective_for_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no home or natural remedies available for genital herpes, and as mentioned above, the infection cannot be cured. Home cares such as warm baths, keeping the blisters dry after washing, and wearing loose-fitting, cotton underwear may help soothe symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_%0Aa_person_with_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As discussed previously, there is no cure for genital herpes infection, and the infection persists for life. People vary in the number and severity of outbreaks they experience. For those with frequent outbreaks, taking antiviral medications as suppressive therapy can decrease the frequency of outbreaks.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kind_of_doctors_treats_genital_herpes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Genital herpes is treated by primary care providers including internal medicine and family medicine specialists, as well as pediatricians for adolescents. For women, gynecologists are often the treating physicians. In certain circumstances, other specialists may be consulted, including urologists and infectious disease specialists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_link_between_genital_herpes_and_hiv" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> virus that causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acquired_immunodeficiency_syndrome_aids/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">AIDS</a> is not the same as the genital herpes virus.
