<p><b><a name="what_is_the_most_common_cause_of_sex_problems_among_men_and_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While they can take many forms, 
sexual problems are defined as any physical or emotional issue that prevents a couple from achieving a mutually satisfying intimate relationship. Among the most common for men include prostate problems, a decrease in the blood supply to the penis due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a>, or other health concerns, nerve damage to the spinal cord, or a decrease in the hormone testosterone. 
</p>.<p>
Common sexual problems in women common problems include a lack of desire caused by a decrease in the hormone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogen</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid disorders</a> (which can also affect some men), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> during intercourse caused by any number of vaginal problems, including a lack of lubrication. 
</p>.<p>
Some couples also find that the use of certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> can also cause sexual problems. These include alcohol, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nicotine/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nicotine</a>, narcotics, stimulants, some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> drugs, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antihistamines</a>, and certain 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antidepressant</a> medications.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_most_common_sexual_problem_in_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Studies show it is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_sex_problems_in_men/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premature ejaculation</a>, which can affect up to 75% of men. Clinically it is defined as the release of the ejaculate from the penis either before intercourse can take place, or quickly after it starts, usually within less than 15 "thrusts." While every man will experience premature ejaculation at least once in their life, for some the problem is chronic. When this is the case causes can be linked to a highly sensitive and easily stimulated nervous system, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>, or sometimes a lack of control over the body's response to excitement. A frequently overlooked cause of temporary premature ejaculation is an infection in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostate gland</a> known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostatitis_inflammation_of_the_prostate_gland/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostatitis</a>. When this is the case, a course of antibiotics often solves the problem. Temporary problems can also result from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, or from the use of certain medications including some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> pills.
</p>.<p>
Treatments for chronic premature ejaculation include the antidepressant medication <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clomipramine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Anafranil</a> taken 12 hours before sex, and use of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">condom</a> to help reduce sensation. Sometimes a prescription <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lidocaine</a> cream can also help by reducing sensation, but that can also impact the partner.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_true_definition_of_erectile_dysfunction_--_and_what_are_the_most_common_causes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Erectile dysfunction</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ED</a>), also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impotence</a>, has a far broader definition than many couples realize.

Additionally, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alcohol abuse</a> is a major contributing factor, and in some men,

As such, the most common reasons for sexual dysfunction are often based in matters of desire, sexual arousal, or sometimes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/painful_intercourse/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">painful intercourse</a>. Some women also report an inability to have an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_health_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">orgasm</a> or experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> when achieving one.
</p>.<p>
While a decrease in desire can be caused by many things, including a negative relationship with a partner, or other life stresses, physical causes are often traced to a decrease in the hormones estrogen and testosterone that occur during 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>. Not only can this put a damper on desire, it can also cause a 
decrease in vaginal lubrication making it more difficult to become aroused and causing intercourse to be painful. In addition, certain illnesses, most notably a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid</a> disorder or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, can also impact a woman's desire. The inability to achieve orgasm is seldom caused by a physical problem, but more often the result of inadequate stimulation by a woman's partner.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_pain_in_the_penis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Like in any other part of the body, pain in the penis can be the result of many things, including infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>, or disease. Excessive manipulation can sometimes lead to pain, as can simple things such as 
insect bites or

yeast or other

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cystitis</a> or
urethritis (infections of the urinary tract), or certain orthopaedic problems. In some instances, even chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> may play a role. A condition known as vulvar vestibulitis, an inflammation in a particular area of the vagina, is the most commonly overlooked cause of dyspareunia.
</p>.<p>
A specific type of dyspareunia known as vaginismus causes involuntary spasms of the muscles within the vagina. In some instances, they can be so strong, the vagina seals shut making penetration extremely painful or sometimes, impossible.

Here it mixes with urine and eventually leaves the body as a waste product. The problem isn't harmful unless the couple is 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trying to conceive</a>. Retrograde ejaculation can occur either partially or completely. In either instance the cause is frequently linked to prior prostate or urethral surgery, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, and the use of certain drugs including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">medications for high blood pressure</a>. Controlling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reasons_for_blood_sugar_swings_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood sugar</a> can help improve the problem, as can some epinephrine-like drugs.

The condition itself is known as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/priapism_penis_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">priapism</a> and it's defined, in clinical terms, as an erection that lasts four hours or more without sexual stimulation. Normally, stimulation causes blood to flow into the penis, which in turn results in an erection. After ejaculation -- or if stimulation is discontinued -- the blood drains and the erection recedes. When priapism occurs, blood that is sent to fill the penis becomes trapped, causing the erection to remain without relief. Not only can this be extremely painful, if not treated early on it can result in scarring inside the penis, and sometimes, permanent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_erectile_dysfunction_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">erectile dysfunction</a>. Priapism can occur in any male, even newborns, but most commonly develops between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and 20 and 50 years old. Treatment can be as simple as applying ice packs, or may involve injecting the penis with medications, or removing blood from the penis to reduce pain and swelling.

While no one is certain what's behind the problem, some say it may be related to the sudden change in blood flow and subsequent drop in blood pressure following orgasm.
