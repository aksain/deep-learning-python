<p><b><a name="aspergers_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Asperger's syndrome, also known as Asperger disorder or Asperger syndrome, is one of a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that have effects on an individual's behavior, use of language and communication, and pattern of social interactions. Asperger disorder was formerly characterized as one distinct <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">autism</a> spectrum disorder (others included autistic disorder, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]), although Asperger's syndrome was considered to be at the milder, or higher-functioning, range of this spectrum. There is still some controversy as to whether Asperger's syndrome should be regarded as a separate clinical entity or simply represents a high-functioning form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_spectrum_disorder_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">autism</a>. In the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published in May 2013, Asperger's syndrome and autistic disorder have been combined into one condition for diagnostic purposes, known as ASD. This change was controversial, because many experts believe that people formerly diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome will not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Also, many experts feel that Asperger's syndrome should be preserved as a separate diagnostic entity to represent a condition related to, but not the same as, autism. Those diagnosed with Asperger's disorder were felt to have a higher-functioning form of autism or autism-related condition. People with Asperger's syndrome typically have normal to above-average intelligence but typically have difficulties with social interactions and often have pervasive, absorbing interests in special topics.</p>.<p>Asperger's syndrome is named for Dr. Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, who first described the condition in 1944. Dr. Asperger described four boys who showed "a lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements." Because of their obsessive interests in and knowledge of particular subjects, he termed the boys "little professors." The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognized Asperger disorder as a specific entity and published diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) in 1994. Most recently, after significant deliberation, the APA recommended "subsuming" Asperger's Disorder into Autism Spectrum Disorders for the next edition DSM-V.</p>.<p>Today, many experts in the field <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> the particular gifts and positive aspects of Asperger syndrome and consider it to represent a different, but not necessarily defective, way of thinking. Positive characteristics of people with Asperger syndrome have been described as beneficial in many professions and include:</p>.<p>Dr. Temple Grandin, a noted engineer, author, and professor who suffers from Asperger disorder believes that her condition has been an asset in her professional life. Her life and story was featured in a film that first aired in 2010.</p>.<p>Although the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome is not possible without direct testing and observation of an individual, it has been suggested by some authors that many successful historical figures may have had Asperger's syndrome, including Mozart, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Marie Curie. Of course, definitive diagnosis of historical figures with Asperger's syndrome is not possible, and many of the traits exhibited by people with Asperger's syndrome can also occur because of intellectual giftedness or even attention deficit disorder (ADD).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If one accepts the conclusion that Asperger's syndrome is one of the autistic 
disorders, then the causes of Asperger's syndrome would be expected to be the same 
as the causes of autism. The precise causes of autistic disorders have not been 
identified, although an inherited (genetic) component is believed to be 
involved. Supporting this idea is the fact that Asperger's syndrome has been 
observed to run in families. In some cases, autistic disorders may be related to 
toxic exposures, teratogens, problems with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> or birth, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prenatal</a> 
infections. These environmental influences may act together to modify or 
potentially increase the severity of the underlying genetic defect.</p>.<p>Some authors have suggested a causal role for vaccine exposure (particularly 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">measles</a> vaccine and thimerosal, a mercury preservative used in some vaccines) in 
autism. However, the overwhelming majority of epidemiologic evidence shows no 
evidence for an association between immunizations and autism, and experts have 
discredited this theory.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Asperger's syndrome is five times more common in boys than in girls. In recent years, the number of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically in the U.S. The reason for the increase is not fully clear, but is likely due to both improvements and modifications in the diagnostic process that result in an increase in the number of children being identified, as well as some degree of true increase in the incidence of the disorders themselves. The CDC notes one out of every 59 children in the U.S. has an autism spectrum disorder.</p>.<p>Asperger's syndrome has been estimated to affect two and a half out of every 1000 children, based upon the total number of children with autistic disorders.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Social-behavioral symptoms can begin as early as infancy. Characteristic 
differences are seen in social development, but these changes are hard to 
identify in toddlers and may be attributed to another condition or not perceived 
as abnormal. Most cases of Asperger's syndrome are identified when the child is 
school-aged or older; studies have shown an average age at diagnosis of 11 
years. Some of the symptoms that may be present are:</p>.<p>Another defining characteristic of Asperger's syndrome is the presence of 
perseverative and obsessive interests in special topics (such as cars or trains, 
or even more narrow topics such as vacuum cleaners), which may be of little 
interest to others.</p>.<p>Language development in children with Asperger's syndrome is generally normal, 
in contrast to other autistic conditions. Children with Asperger's syndrome have 
normal scores on tests for language function involving vocabulary, syntax, and 
grammar. In fact, some experts believe the presence of normal language 
development distinguishes Asperger's syndrome from high-functioning autism. 
However, the use or application of language skills is altered in people with 
Asperger's syndrome: </p>.<p>In school, children with Asperger's syndrome tend to excel with the rote 
learning often required in the early grades. As they get older, they may have 
more difficulties in school due to the nature of reading comprehension and 
written assignments. Special education support is sometimes, but not always, 
necessary.</p>.<p>Sometimes, people with Asperger disorder have other associated psychiatric 
conditions or may show behaviors that are typical for other conditions. Some 
common associated conditions include the following (but these are not always 
present):</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_aspergers_syndrome_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diagnosis is based upon interviews and observation of the individual along with interviews of his/her family members and sometimes teachers or counselors. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is published by the American Psychiatric Association and includes the diagnostic criteria for all recognized psychiatric conditions.</p>.<p>The DSM-IV had specific diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome. However, revision of the DSM-IV was carried out, with a 5th edition (DSM-V) published in May 2013. In this new version, Asperger's syndrome is included in the same diagnostic group as people with autism and pervasive developmental disorders. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_or_complications_of_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned before, Asperger's syndrome may coexist with other psychiatric 
conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_children_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_children_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ADHD</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> disorder. 
Even when anxiety disorder is not present, people with Asperger's syndrome may 
suffer from anxiety or hypersensitivity to certain stimuli such as loud noises. 
In some cases, disruptive behaviors (tantrums, self-injury, and aggression) and/or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> may occur in response to the anxiety and frustration experienced by 
sufferers of Asperger's syndrome. Other behaviors that have been reported in 
people with Asperger's syndrome include 
obsessive-compulsive behaviors and 
difficulties with anger management.</p>.<p>As with any condition, the degree of severity of symptoms can vary widely 
among individuals, and not all persons with Asperger's syndrome will experience 
associated psychiatric disorders, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, or disruptive behaviors.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of Asperger's syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach.</p>.<p>Medical therapy is not effective in treating Asperger syndrome, although 
medications may be prescribed to help control troubling symptoms or symptoms of 
other psychiatric conditions that may coexist with Asperger's syndrome. In some 
cases, selective <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">serotonin</a> reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are used for 
relief of anxiety or depression. Medical treatments for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ADHD</a> may also be tried 
if there is significant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperactivity/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperactivity</a> and/or distraction.</p>.<p>A number of behavioral and educational interventions can help people with 
Asperger's syndrome, although all of these may not be necessary in a given 
individual. The type of interventions chosen must be based upon the individual's 
age and needs. Types of interventions that have been shown to be of benefit 
include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_aspergers_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An estimation of the prognosis of Asperger's syndrome is difficult, if not 
impossible, since affected individuals have variable degrees of impairment, and 
the provision of treatment can dramatically improve the long-term outlook for 
people with Asperger's syndrome. In general, when social, behavioral, and 
educational support is provided as needed, people with Asperger's syndrome can be 
expected to lead happy and productive lives.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
