<p><b><a name="primary_biliary_cirrhosis_pbc_definition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary biliary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cirrhosis</a> (PBC) is a progressive disease of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> caused 
by a buildup of bile within the liver (cholestasis) that results in damage to 
the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Over time, this pressure 
build-up destroys the bile ducts leading to liver cell damage. As the disease 
progresses and enough liver cells die, 
cirrhosis and liver failure occur.</p>.<p>Bile is manufactured in the liver and then transported through the bile ducts 
to the gallbladder and intestine where it helps digest <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat_and_fats_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fats</a> and fat soluble 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a> (A,D,E,K). When bile cannot be drained from the liver, it causes 
inflammation that leads to cell death. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Scar tissue</a> gradually replaces the areas 
of damaged liver and then the body cannot perform necessary functions.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_primary_biliary_cirrhosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of PBC is unknown. It is most likely an autoimmune disease, where 
the body's immune system attacks its own cells. In this disease, the bile ducts 
are under attack and are destroyed.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_primary_biliary_cirrhosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_for_primary_biliary_cirrhosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Up to a quarter of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are asymptomatic, 
meaning they do not have symptoms at the time of diagnosis and the disease is 
found incidentally because of 
abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_blood_tests/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver blood tests</a>.</p>.<p>The most common initial symptoms are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> or a sense of being abnormally 
tired and, skin that itches. Because of the intense <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a> and 
scratching, the skin may become darkened and discolored in some areas. The 
person may also complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dry mouth</a> and 
eyes.</p>.<p>Because there may be liver inflammation, some people may experience right 
upper quadrant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>, where the liver is located.</p>.<p>Should the liver damage progress, the symptoms of cirrhosis may develop. 
These include muscle wasting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascites/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ascites</a> (swelling of the abdomen due to fluid

and physical examination. Initially there may be few symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a> or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> to help guide further testing</p>.<p>The diagnosis may be made incidentally should abnormal liver functions be 
found on routine blood tests drawn for another reason. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Liver function</a> tests 
include AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT 
(gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Blood 
levels tend to become elevated in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a> and they may rise in specific 
patterns depending upon the underlying cause of inflammation.</p>.<p>Once the diagnosis is suspected, a blood test to check for antimitochondrial 
antibody (AMA) is usually done. This is positive in 90% to 95% of patients with PBC.</p>.<p>Other blood tests may be considered including a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">complete blood count</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CBC</a>)

diagnosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_primary_biliary_cirrhosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The only "cure" for primary biliary cirrhosis is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_transplant/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver transplant</a>, but it is 
only considered as a treatment option if other less aggressive treatments have

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/portal_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">portal hypertension</a>, gastrointestinal bleeding, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>, and vitamin 
deficiencies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_primary_biliary_cirrhosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The complications of primary biliary cirrhosis develop as the ability of the 
liver to function decreases. Cirrhosis describes liver scarring and failure. The 
liver is responsible for helping to digest food, producing proteins, blood 
clotting factors, and enzymes that help digest food. Some complications include 
the following:</p>.<p><b>Ascites: </b>Fluid collection within the abdomen that occurs because the liver 
cannot produce enough albumin, a protein that helps keep fluid within the blood 
vessels. Ascites fluid is prone to infection and a condition called spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis (peritoneum=sac that contains the abdominal organs + 
itis=inflammation)</p>.<p><b>Edema</b>: Swelling of the legs may occur, again because of decreased albumin 
levels in the body</p>.<p><b>Easy bruising or bleeding:
</b>The liver is responsible for producing blood 
clotting factors. Without an adequate supply, there is an increased risk of 
bleeding.</p>.<p><b>
Hepatic encephalopathy</b>: The liver also helps remove waste products from the 
bloodstream. Ammonia is the chemical waste product of protein <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss_boost_metabolism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a> and the 
body requires a healthy liver to metabolize it. If ammonia levels rise, 
confusion and lethargy (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">encephalopathy</a>) may occur. </p>.<p>P<b>ortal hypertension:</b> An increase in pressure within the liver can cause blood flow issues leading to 
portal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>. This may backup blood flow from other organs, causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">splenomegaly</a>, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">enlarged spleen</a>, and varices, swollen veins, especially in the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a> and stomach that can predispose to bleeding.</p>.<p><b>Osteoporosis:</b> PBC is also complicated by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>, difficulty in absorbing nutrients 
from the intestine, and increased risk of infection because of a compromised 
immune system.</p>.<p><b>Cancer:</b> Hepatocellular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">carcinoma</a> is a complication of PBC, occurring in up to 6% of 
patients.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_primary_biliary_cirrhosis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since the cause of the disease is not known, it is not possible to prevent 
PBC. However, medications may be able to slow the progression of the disease and 
control the symptoms.</p>.<p>Should a person develop PBC, all attempts should be made to prevent further 
potential damage. This may include limiting alcohol intake, avoiding the use of 
medications that contain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tylenol</a>, Panadol), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a> 
lowering agents.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_someone_with_primary_biliary_cirrhosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>PBC is a progressive disease that can be controlled but not cured. The prognosis depends upon a variety of factors including whether the patient has symptoms (especially <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>), liver function test abnormalities, and whether the patient has undergone treatment with medication or has required liver transplantation.</p>.<p>Advances in treatment have extended the life expectancy in the past many years. The average survival from diagnosis for a patient with PBC who is asymptomatic is 16 years, while that of patients with symptoms is 7 1/2 years.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
