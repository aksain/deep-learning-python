<p><b><a name="laxatives_definition_and_constipation_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_constipation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Constipation is a condition characterized by infrequent bowel movements that are painful or difficult, or stools that are hard in consistency. Infrequent bowel movements alone are not a reliable indicator of constipation because bowel frequency can vary between three times a day to once a week among normal individuals. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hard stools</a> that are difficult to pass or infrequent stools accompanied by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>,

These foods are high in fiber and 
can help get things moving, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_over-the-counter_otc_laxatives_help_cure_constipation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Laxatives are medicines that increase the frequency and ease of passing stool. Many types of laxatives are available over-the-counter (OTC) for the relief of mild, occasional constipation. If 
constipation becomes moderate to severe or does not respond to OTC products, 
consult a doctor.</p>.<p>Most OTC laxatives are safe, effective, and well tolerated. There are distinct 
types of laxatives 
that function differently and have varying degrees of  effectiveness and potential side effects. Talk to your doctor about the best laxative for your needs.  </p>.<p><b><a name="pros_and_precautions_for_using_bulk-forming_laxatives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bulk-forming laxatives are the most commonly recommended initial treatments for constipation 
as they tend to be the most gentle. Bulk-forming laxatives may work as quickly as 12 hours or take as long as three days to be effective. Some bulk-forming laxatives are derived from natural sources such as agar, psyllium, kelp (alginates), and plant gum. Others are synthetic cellulose compounds such as methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose. Natural and synthetic bulk-forming laxatives act similarly. They dissolve or swell in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a>, lubricate and soften the stool, and make the passage of stool easier and more frequent.</p>.<p>Examples of bulk-forming laxatives include:</p>.<p>Many of these agents are available as powders and are 
taken mixed with fluids. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Fruit drinks</a>, fruit juice, and soft drinks mask the gritty taste of these laxatives better than water. Some are available as wafers, which are designed to be eaten with a separate beverage.</p>.<p><b><a name="pros_and_precautions_for_using_stool_softeners_emollient_laxatives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stool softeners, called emollient laxatives, prevent hardening of the feces by adding moisture to the stool. The active ingredient in most stool softeners is a medicine called docusate. Agents containing docusate do not by themselves stimulate or increase the number of bowel movements. They are used more to prevent constipation than to treat it. </p>.<p>Stool softeners are commonly recommended for individuals who should avoid straining while defecating, including those:</p>.<p>Softening the stool in these affected individuals can help reduce pain during defecation.</p>.<p>Stool softeners available OTC include:</p>.<p>Some preparations  (for example, Peri-Colace) combine a stool softener with a stimulant laxative to activate bowel movements.</p>.<p>Stool softeners are generally safe and well tolerated. </p>.<p>They should not be combined with mineral oil, a lubricant laxative, because stool softeners may increase the absorption and toxicity of mineral oil. Mineral oil droplets absorbed into the body can deposit and cause 
inflammation in the lymph glands, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a>, and spleen.</p>.<p><b><a name="pros_and_precautions_for_using_lubricant_laxatives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mineral oil (liquid petrolatum) coats and softens stool. Like stool softeners, mineral oil is used by patients who need to avoid straining (for example, after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hernia_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hernia</a> repair, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemorrhoids_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemorrhoid</a> surgery, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attacks</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/7_childbirth_and_delivery_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">childbirth</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="pros_and_precautions_for_using_stimulant_laxatives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stimulant laxatives are fast-acting laxatives that induce bowel movements by increasing the contraction of muscles in the intestines, and are effective when used on a short-term basis. Examples of stimulant laxatives include:</p>.<p><b>Bisacodyl:</b> Bisacodyl (Dulcolax, Correctol) is available over-the-counter in oral pill form and as a suppository or enema. The oral form takes 6 to 10 hours to work. Bisacodyl is commonly used in cleansing the colon for colonoscopies, barium enemas, and intestinal surgeries. While effective for occasional constipation, bisacodyl should not be taken for more than a week, and a doctor should supervise repeated use.</p>.<p><b>Senna, cascara sagrada, and casanthranol:</b> Other stimulant laxatives include senna (Ex-Lax, Senokot), cascara sagrada (Nature's Remedy), and casanthranol. These laxatives are converted by the bacteria in the colon into active compounds, which then stimulate the contraction of colon muscles. After taking these products orally, bowel movements occur quickly, after only 8 to 24 hours. Prolonged, chronic use of these laxatives can cause the lining of the colon to become darker than normal (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanosis_coli/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">melanosis coli</a>) due to the accumulation of a pigment (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">melanin</a>).</p>.<p><b>Castor oil:</b> Castor oil (an ingredient of Purge Concentrate) is a liquid stimulant laxative that works in the small intestine. It causes the accumulation of fluid in the small intestine and promotes evacuation of the bowels. Castor oil should not be taken with food, although juice or other flavored liquids can help hide its unpleasant taste. This laxative works rather quickly, usually within 2 to 6 hours. Castor oil is usually used to cleanse the colon for surgery, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barium_enema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">barium enema</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">colonoscopy</a>. The absorption of nutrients and minerals by the small intestine can be impaired by the frequent use of castor oil. This medicine is not recommended for the repeated treatment for constipation.</p>.<p><b><a name="pros_and_precautions_for_using_saline_laxatives_and_osmotic_laxatives" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="pros_and_precautions_for_using_enemas_and_suppositories" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rectally administered enemas and suppositories are commonly used to cleanse the rectum and the sigmoid colon (the part of the colon closest to the rectum) prior to surgery, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childbirth_class_options/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">childbirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flexible_sigmoidoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flexible sigmoidoscopy</a>. Enemas and suppositories are used to relieve constipation and rectal fecal impaction (blockage of the rectum by hard, compacted stool). They can also be used in conjunction with oral laxatives in cleansing the colon in preparation for barium enema studies. Some suppositories contain stimulant laxatives.</p>.<p>Enemas and suppositories include docusate (Microenema), bisacodyl (Dulcolax Suppository), and sodium phosphate (Fleet Enema). These products are intended for occasional use and are not recommended as a chronic laxative regimen unless directed by a physician.</p>.<p>Individuals should carefully follow instructions in using enemas. The person should lie on the left side with the knees bent. The enema solution should be inserted slowly into the rectum. The person should retain the solution in the rectum until definite rectal pressure and the urge to have a bowel movement are felt. Evacuation usually occurs within minutes to an hour.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_laxatives_are_safe_for_infants_toddlers_and_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If an infant is younger than four months old and seems constipated, contact the child's pediatrician. For older children, home remedies including dietary modifications may help relieve constipation. If a child has been constipated for a short time, changing the diet may be the only treatment needed. It is common for infants to become constipated when they transition to solid foods, and often adding fiber to the diet can ease constipation.</p>.<p>The following natural treatments may be used for infants older than four months of age, or for children with constipation:</p>.<p>Parents or caregivers should contact the physician immediately if the child has severe abdominal pain, swollen or bloated abdomen, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rectal_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rectal pain</a>, or bleeding. If there are any concerns about the child's bowel habits or questions about diet, parents or caregivers should talk to their child's pediatrician.

Pressure from the uterus pushes on the bowels and can cause constipation.</p>.<p>Dietary and behavioral modifications can ease constipation during pregnancy and are considered safe. 
It's best to try these natural remedies first to treat constipation during 
pregnancy.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pregnant</a> women should talk with their doctor before using over-the-counter laxatives or stool softeners during pregnancy. Laxatives can cause fluid loss and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>, so it is important not to overuse them during pregnancy. 
Avoid cod liver oil as a treatment for constipation if you are pregnant because it may prevent the absorption of needed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a> and minerals. 
</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_a_doctor_be_consulted_for_constipation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many people have a life-long tendency toward constipation while others have occasional constipation alternating with a normal bowel pattern or even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. While mild and intermittent constipation in these individuals is usually not a cause for concern, a doctor should be consulted under the following circumstances:</p>.<p><b><a name="are_laxatives_safe_to_take_for_weight_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Laxatives are not intended as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a> supplements. It may seem as if you lost weight once a laxative has taken effect and your constipation is relieved, but by the time stool reaches the large intestine (colon), most of the fat and calories from your food has already been absorbed by the small intestines. What you do lose is water, electrolytes, minerals, and indigestible fiber. Any "water weight" you may lose comes back as soon as you drink fluids. </p>.<p>Laxative abuse occurs when people frequently take laxatives to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lose weight</a>. Often, laxatives are taken after binge eating in an attempt to purge calories. This is part of an eating disorder called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bulimia_nervosa/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bulimia</a>. There are serious health consequences to laxative abuse, including life-threatening complications. Laxatives deplete the body of needed electrolytes and minerals, which the body needs. This can lead to malfunctions of your vital organs. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dehydration</a> caused by laxative abuse can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fainting</a>, kidney damage, and even death. </p>.<p>When people use laxatives consistently, dependence can develop and the colon stops working the way it should, and it can take larger and larger doses of laxatives to result in bowel movements. Chronic abuse of laxatives can increase the risk of developing colon <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>. </p>.<p>
If you are abusing laxatives in the hope of losing weight, or if you think you may be addicted to laxatives, talk to your doctor to get help.
