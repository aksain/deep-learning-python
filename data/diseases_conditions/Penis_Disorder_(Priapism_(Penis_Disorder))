<p><b><a name="what_is_the_definition_of_priapism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Priapism is a prolonged, unwanted erection of the penis. It is usually 
painful and not related to sexual stimulation or arousal. 
<b>Most clinicians 
consider priapism a medical emergency</b> because the condition can result in 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impotence</a>, sexual dysfunction or penile infection. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_priapism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A normal erection occurs in response to sexual stimulation. Priapism occurs in several conditions that interfere with the blood flow to the penis or blood drainage from the penis. This condition is unrelated to sexual stimulation and can last for several hours. Below are some of the causes of priapism.</p>.<p>Medical conditions that can cause priapism:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Trauma</a> as a cause of priapism:</p>.<p>Medications (several <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> have priapism as a side effect):</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_priapism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Priapism results in a persistent erection. Priapism is usually divided into three categories.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_priapism_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of priapism is based on history (asking the patient questions) and the 
physical exam of the genitalia. Once a health care professional has finished this 
part of the exam a few other tests might be ordered.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_priapism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of ischemic priapism includes several modalities and will depend on how long the priapism has been present, and the results of the blood tests. These interventions are performed in a step wise fashion with surgery being the last resort. Unfortunately, some of the treatments of priapism can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_pictures_slideshow_erectile_dysfunction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">erectile dysfunction</a> in the future.</p>.<p>Treatments for priapism are as follows:</p>.<p>Ice to the area around the genitals is sometime utilized. In severe cases surgical procedures are available.</p>.<p>Non-ischemic priapism is usually not an emergency and will frequently resolve without interventions.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_priapism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ischemic priapism can cause significant complications. Due to the lack of oxygen, there can be significant damage if priapism lasts for more than four hours. The complications include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_erectile_dysfunction_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">erectile dysfunction</a> as well as disfigurement of the penis.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_to_see_a_health_care_professional" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A painful erection lasting for more than 4 hours should trigger an emergency 
department visit. If the unwanted erection resolves in less than four hours a 
nonemergent doctor's visit should be scheduled.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_priapism_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Priapism or recurrence of priapism can be prevented by treating the 
underlying medical cause that resulted in priapism or changing medications that 
have priapism as their side effects. No medications should be discontinued or 
changed until you speak with your healthcare provider.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
