<p><b><a name="bee_and_wasp_sting_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="insect_stings_overview" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bee and wasp stings are common causes of medical problems. Bees and wasps, together with fire ants, are all related insects that belong to the <i>Hymenoptera</i> order. Bee and wasp stings can cause significant reactions, ranging from localized <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> and swelling to serious and even potentially fatal conditions. At least 90 to 100 deaths occur each year in the U.S. as a result of serious anaphylactic sting reactions.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_wasps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are over 25,000 species of wasps found throughout the world. Some of the most common wasps include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_bees" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bees include the honey bee, the so-called Africanized honey bee (also known as "killer bee"), and the bumble bee. Bumble bees are large, furry-appearing bees that fulfill the beneficial role of pollinating many plants. Honeybees, also active plant pollinators, are found all over the world. While honey bees are not usually aggressive, they will sting if bothered or threatened. Because their wings flap so rapidly, their presence is associated with a buzzing sound. Although the venom of the "killer bees" found in the Western and Southern U.S. is no more potent than that of regular honeybees, their behavior may be more aggressive. Killer bees may chase victims when agitated and may also attack in greater numbers, thereby increasing the chances of a severe reaction to their stings. Overall, there are more than 20,000 species of bees found worldwide.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_of_bee_and_wasp_stings" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most stings arise because an insect perceives a threat to their colony. Bees and wasps commonly sting because an intruder has neared the hive or nest. Loud noises (such as lawn mowers), bright or dark colors, and certain perfumes or perfumed body products may also encourage stings. Some types of insect venom contain pheromones, which attract other members of the colony and induce them to sting.</p>.<p>When bees or wasps sting an individual, they inject venom under the skin of their victim. </p>.<p>Bee and wasp venoms vary according to species but typically contain toxic components as well as antigens that stimulate an immune response.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_bee_or_wasp_sting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Insect stings may produce four types of reactions, each with characteristic symptoms as below:</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_a_doctor_about_a_bee_or_wasp_sting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most bee and wasp stings can be treated at home, but some require medical attention. If there is any suspicion at all that a person is having a systemic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic reaction</a>, seek immediate emergency medical assistance. Signs that a person may be having a systemic reaction include widespread hives or rash, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wheezing/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wheezing</a>, difficulty breathing, and swelling in the mouth and throat areas. If a person is stung by an insect whose sting has previously caused an anaphylactic reaction, he or she should also access emergency medical care even if no symptoms are present.</p>.<p>You should also seek medical care if any of the following conditions are present:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_bee_or_wasp_sting_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most cases the victim or an observer will have witnessed the sting. Depending upon the type of insect, the stinging apparatus may be found embedded in the skin, but this is not the case with wasps and some types of bees. The characteristic symptoms for each type of reaction along with the history of a sting are typically sufficient to establish a diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_bee_or_wasp_sting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for a mild allergic reaction (such as a rash without any breathing difficulty) usually involves the administration of antihistamine medications and sometimes steroid medications to reduce inflammation.</p>.<p>The treatment of choice for life-threatening anaphylactic reactions is epinephrine. Emergency medical treatments may also include steroid and antihistamine medications and insertion of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endotracheal_intubation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breathing tube</a>. Intravenous fluids and medications to support <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardiovascular</a> function may also be required. Treatment may be begun at the scene by emergency medical personnel and continued in the hospital.</p>.<p>Doctors can prescribe an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> kit containing self-administered epinephrine (Epi-Pen) for persons at risk for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anaphylaxis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">severe allergic reaction</a>, including those with known <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergy</a> to bee or wasp stings. These self-administered injectable epinephrine treatments can be life-saving in many cases. It is important to have kits readily available at home, in the car, at work, etc. and to know how to use them properly.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy_shots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Immunotherapy</a> is sometimes recommended for those with a history of severe allergic reactions to stings. In this treatment, a series of shots ("<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy_shots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">allergy shots</a>") are used to provide low-dose exposure to venom.
