Anyone experiencing symptoms of meningitis should see a doctor immediately.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_encephalomyelitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Encephalomyelitis is inflammation of both the brain and spinal cord. Encephalomyelitis can be caused by a variety of conditions that lead to irritation of the brain and spinal cord. Among the common causes of encephalomyelitis are viruses that infect the nervous tissues (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">herpes zoster</a> virus). People with encephalomyelitis can exhibit combinations of the various symptoms of either encephalitis or meningitis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_encephalitis_and_meningitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients with a suppressed immune system, either because of medications (organ transplant recipients, etc.) or from a disease that suppresses the immune system (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a>, for example), are at increased risk for encephalitis and meningitis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialties_of_doctors_treat_encephalitis_and_meningitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Encephalitis and meningitis usually needs to be treated in the hospital. A family practice or general internal-medicine physician or an infectious-disease specialist will usually be treating those with meningitis or encephalitis.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_encephalitis_and_meningitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Encephalitis or meningitis is suggested when the symptoms described above are present. The doctor diagnoses encephalitis or meningitis after a completing a thorough history (asking the patient questions) and examination. The examination includes special maneuvers to detect signs of inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges). These signs and symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stiff_neck/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">neck stiffness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">headache</a>, and fever. Based on the history and examination, the doctor suggests specific tests to further help in determining the diagnosis.</p>.<p>Tests that are used in the evaluation of individuals suspected of having encephalitis or meningitis include evaluation of the blood for signs of infection and possible presence of bacteria, brain scanning (such as CT scan or MRI scan), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.</p>.<p>A lumbar puncture is the most common method of obtaining a sample of the fluid in the spinal canal (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) for examination. A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the fluid within the spinal canal. It is termed a "lumbar puncture" because the needle goes into the lumbar portion of the back (the lower portion of the back). The needle passes between the bony parts of the spine until it reaches the cerebral spinal fluid. A small amount of fluid is then collected and sent to the laboratory for examination. The evaluation of the spinal fluid is usually necessary for the definitive diagnosis and to help make optimal treatment decisions (such as the appropriate choice of antibiotics in the case of bacterial meningitis).</p>.<p>The diagnosis is confirmed by abnormal spinal fluid results and, in the case of an infection, by identifying the organism causing the infection. In patients with meningitis, the CSF fluid often has a low glucose (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sugar</a>) level and increased white blood cell count. In addition, the fluid can be used to identify some viral causes of meningitis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">polymerase chain reaction</a>) or be used to culture bacterial organisms causing the meningitis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_of_encephalitis_and_meningitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Antibiotic and/or antiviral medications need to be considered urgently when the diagnosis of encephalitis or meningitis is suggested. In some situations, anticonvulsants are used to prevent or treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epilepsy_and_seizures_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">seizures</a> (a possible side effect of inflammation of the brain). Sometimes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroids</a> are administered to reduce brain swelling and inflammation. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypnotics_drug_class_side_effects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sedatives</a> may be needed for irritability or restlessness. Additional medications might be used to decrease the fever or treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a>. The need for hospitalization usually depends on the type of meningitis the patient has and the severity of symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_outlook_and_what_are_the_complications_for_patients_with_encephalitis_or_meningitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for encephalitis or meningitis varies. Some cases are mild, short, and relatively benign and patients have full recovery. Other cases are severe, and permanent impairment, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">brain damage</a>, or death is possible. This is usually determined by the type of infection present and how quickly treatment can be started. Meningitis can lead to permanent damage to the nervous system and can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocephalus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hydrocephalus</a>. The acute phase of encephalitis may last for one to two weeks, with gradual or sudden resolution of fever and neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms may require many months before full recovery occurs. Some patients will not fully recover.</p>.<p>With early diagnosis and prompt treatment, many patients recover from meningitis. Viral meningitis can be self-limited to 10 days or less. However, in some cases, the disease progresses so rapidly that death occurs during the first 48 hours, despite early treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_meningitis_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, some forms of bacterial meningitis are contagious. The bacteria are spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions (for example, coughing, kissing, sharing of utensils). Sometimes the bacteria that cause meningitis can spread to other people who have had close or prolonged contact with a patient with meningitis. Meningitis caused by <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> (also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">meningococcal meningitis</a>) is the most important example. People in the same household, dormitory, or day care center, or anyone with direct contact with a patient's oral secretions would be considered at increased risk of acquiring the infection. This also holds true for health care professionals involved in direct, prolonged contact, especially during procedures such as intubations (placing a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endotracheal_intubation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breathing tube</a>). People who qualify as close contacts of a person with meningitis caused by <i>N. meningitidis</i> should receive antibiotics to prevent them from getting the disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_meningitis_is_there_a_meningitis_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Basic steps to avoid spread of organisms, such a hand washing and covering one's mouth when coughing, will also help in decreasing the risk of spreading meningitis. There are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> against Hib (<i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type B) and against some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strains</a> of <i>N. meningitidis</i> and many types of <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/streptococcal_infections/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Streptococcus</a> pneumoniae</i>.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> against Hib are considered very safe and highly effective. By 6 months of age, every infant should receive at least three doses of a Hib <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a>. A fourth dose ("booster") should be given to children between 12 and 18 months of age.</p>.<p>There are several <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> available to prevent <i>N. meningitides</i> (meningococcal) infections in the U.S.</p>.<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine committee has expanded its recommendation for immunization against meningitis B. The previous recommendation was limited to people at high risk of getting the disease, such as lab workers and students at colleges with outbreaks. Now the advisory committee urges all people between the ages of 16 and 23 to discuss this vaccine with their health care professionals and to consider the vaccine.</p>.<p>The CDC recommends meningococcal conjugate vaccine for preteens and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a>, including a booster shot. This is especially important for those intending to attend college as living in the large college environment is a risk factor for developing meningococcal meningitis.</p>.<p>Although large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis do not occur in the United States, some countries experience large, periodic epidemics. Overseas <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">travelers</a> should check to see if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">meningococcal vaccine</a> is recommended for their destination. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Travelers</a> should receive the vaccine at least one week before departure if possible.</p>.<p>A vaccine to prevent meningitis due to <i>S. pneumoniae</i> (also called pneumococcal meningitis) can also prevent other forms of infection due to <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumococcal_vaccine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">pneumococcal vaccine</a> is not effective in children under 2 years of age, but it is recommended for all people over 65 years of age and younger people with certain chronic medical problems.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
