daily routines and activities, or reduces the ability to function, it is called 
"problem sleepiness." A person can be sleepy without realizing it. For example, 
a person may not feel sleepy during activities such as talking and listening to 
music at a party, but the same person can fall asleep while driving home 
afterward.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_problem_sleepiness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may have problem sleepiness if you:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_problem_sleepiness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleepiness can be due to the body's natural daily sleep-wake cycles, 
inadequate sleep, sleep disorders, or certain drugs.</p>.<p><b><a name="sleep-wake_cycle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Each day there are two periods when the body experiences a natural tendency 
toward sleepiness; during the late night hours (generally between midnight and 7 
a.m.) and again during the midafternoon (generally between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.). 
If people are awake during these times, they have a higher risk of falling 
asleep unintentionally, especially if they haven't been getting enough sleep.</p>.<p><b><a name="inadequate_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The amount of sleep needed each night varies among people. Each person needs 
a particular amount of sleep in order to be fully alert throughout the day. 
Research has shown that when healthy adults are allowed to sleep unrestricted, 
the average time slept is 8 to 8.5 hours. Some people need more than that to 
avoid problem sleepiness; others need less.</p>.<p>If a person does not get enough sleep, even on one night, a "sleep debt" 
begins to build and increases until enough sleep is obtained. Problem sleepiness 
occurs as the debt accumulates. Many people do not get enough sleep during the 
work week and then sleep longer on the weekends or days off to reduce their 
sleep debt. If too much sleep has been lost, sleeping in on the weekend may not 
completely reverse the effects of not getting enough sleep during the week.</p>.<p><b><a name="sleep_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/restless_legs_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">restless legs syndrome</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_tips_avoid_insomnia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insomnia</a> can cause problem sleepiness. <i>
Sleep apnea</i> is a serious disorder in which a person's 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a> is interrupted during sleep, causing the 
individual to awaken many times during the night and experience problem 
sleepiness during the day. People with <i>
narcolepsy</i> have excessive 
sleepiness during the day, even after sleeping enough at night. They may fall 
asleep at inappropriate times and places. <i>
Restless legs syndrome (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/restless_leg_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">RLS</a>)</i> 
causes a person to experience unpleasant sensations in the legs, often described 
as creeping, crawling, pulling, or painful. These sensations frequently occur in 
the evening, making it difficult for people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/restless_legs_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">RLS</a> to fall asleep, leading to 
problem sleepiness during the day. <i>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Insomnia</a></i> is the perception of 
poor-quality sleep due to difficulty falling asleep, waking up during the night 
with difficulty returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, or 
unrefreshing sleep. Any of these sleep disorders can cause problem sleepiness. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="medical_conditions/drugs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Certain medical conditions and drugs, including 
prescription medications, can 
also disrupt sleep and cause problem sleepiness. Examples include:</p>.<p><b><a name="problem_sleepiness_and_adolescents" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many U.S. high school and college students have signs of problem sleepiness, 
such as:</p>.<p>The need for sleep may be 9 hours or more per night as a person goes through 
adolescence. At the same time, many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teens</a> begin to show a preference for a later 
bed time, which may be due to a biological change. Teens tend to stay up later 
but have to get up early for school, resulting in their getting much less sleep 
than they need.</p>.<p>Many factors contribute to problem sleepiness in teens and young adults, but 
the main causes are not getting enough sleep and irregular sleep schedules. Some 
of the factors that influence adolescent sleep include:</p>.<p>Teens and young adults who do not get enough sleep are at risk for problems 
such as:</p>.<p>Many adolescents have part-time jobs in addition to their classes and other 
activities. High school students who work more than 20 hours per week have more 
problem sleepiness and may use more caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol than those 
who work less than 20 hours per week or not at all.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="shift_work_and_problem_sleepiness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>About 20 million Americans (20 to 25 percent of workers) perform shift work. 
Most shift workers get less sleep over 24 hours than day workers. Sleep loss is 
greatest for night shift workers, those who work early morning shifts, and 
female shift workers with children at home. About 60 to 70 percent of shift 
workers have difficulty sleeping and/or problem sleepiness.</p>.<p>The human sleep-wake system is designed to prepare the body and mind for 
sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. These natural rhythms make it 
difficult to sleep during daylight hours and to stay awake during the night 
hours, even in people who are well rested. It is possible that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_body_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">human body</a> 
never completely adjusts to nighttime activity and daytime sleep, even in those 
who work permanent night shifts.</p>.<p>In addition to the sleep-wake system, environmental 
factors can influence sleepiness in shift workers. Because our society is 
strongly day-oriented, shift workers who try to sleep during the day are often 
interrupted by noise, light, telephones, family members, and other distractions. 
In contrast, the nighttime 
sleep of day workers is largely protected by social customs that keep noises and 
interruptions to a minimum.</p>.<p>Problem sleepiness in shift workers may result in:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatments_and_remedies_can_help_problem__sleepiness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Sleep-There is no substitute!</b></p>.<p>Many people simply do not allow enough time for sleep on a regular basis. A 
first step may be to evaluate daily activities and sleep-wake patterns to 
determine how much sleep is obtained. If you are consistently getting less than 
8 hours of sleep per night, more sleep may be needed. A good approach is to 
gradually move to an earlier bedtime. For example, if an extra hour of sleep in 
needed, try going to bed 15 minutes earlier each night for four nights and then 
keep the last bedtime. This method will increase the amount of time in bed 
without causing a sudden change in schedule. However, if work or family 
schedules do not permit the earlier bedtime, a 30 to 60 minute daily nap may 
help.</p>.<p><b>Medications/drugs</b></p>.<p>In general, medications do not help problem sleepiness, and some make it 
worse. Caffeine can reduce sleepiness and increase alertness, but only 
temporarily. It can also cause problem sleepiness to become worse by 
interrupting sleep.</p>.<p>While alcohol may shorten the time it takes to fall asleep, it can disrupt 
sleep later in the night, and therefore add to the problem sleepiness.</p>.<p>Medications may be prescribed for patients in certain 
situations. For example, the short-term use of sleeping pills has been shown to 
be helpful in patients diagnosed with acute insomnia. Long-term use of sleep 
medication is 
recommended only for the treatment of specific sleep disorders.</p>.<p><b>If you're sleepy—don't drive!</b></p>.<p>A person who is sleepy and drives is at high risk for an automobile crash. 
Planning ahead may help reduce that risk. For example, the following tips may

day, check with your doctor to be sure your sleepiness is not due to a sleep 
disorder.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
