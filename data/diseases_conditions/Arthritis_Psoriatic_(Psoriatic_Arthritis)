<p><b><a name="psoriatic_arthritis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a form of inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (inflammatory arthritis). Psoriasis is a common skin condition affecting 2% of the Caucasian population in the United States. Signs and symptoms include patchy, raised, red areas of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin inflammation</a> with scaling. Psoriasis often affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">scalp</a> and ears, the navel, and around the genital areas or anus. Approximately 15%-25% of patients who have psoriasis also develop an associated inflammation of their joints. Patients who have inflammatory arthritis and psoriasis are diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis.</p>.<p>The onset of psoriatic arthritis generally occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Males and females are affected equally. The skin disease (psoriasis) and the joint disease (arthritis) often appear separately. In fact, the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of people. However, the arthritis may precede the psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. In some patients, the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can be difficult if the arthritis precedes psoriasis by many years. In fact, some patients have had arthritis for over 20 years before psoriasis eventually appears! Conversely, patients can have psoriasis for over 20 years prior to the development of arthritis, leading to the ultimate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.</p>.<p>Psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that also can cause inflammation in body tissues away from the joints other than the skin, such as in the eyes, heart, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, and kidneys. Psoriatic arthritis shares many symptoms with several other arthritic conditions, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ankylosing_spondylitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reactive_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">reactive arthritis</a>, and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ulcerative colitis</a>. All of these health conditions can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints, and the eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine, these health conditions are collectively referred to as "spondyloarthropathies."<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause of psoriatic arthritis is currently unknown. A combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors is likely involved. In patients with psoriatic arthritis who have arthritis of the spine, a blood test gene marker called HLA-B27 is found in about 50%. Several other genes have also been found to be more common in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Certain changes in the immune system may also be important in the development of psoriatic arthritis. For example, the decline in the number of immune cells called helper T cells in people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acquired_immunodeficiency_syndrome_aids/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">AIDS</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> infection) may play a role in the development and progression of psoriasis in these patients. The importance of infectious agents and other environmental factors in the cause of psoriatic arthritis is being investigated by researchers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_developing_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The major risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis is having a family member with psoriasis. This relationship has been recognized as so significant that it is used as a helpful part of the health history for the doctor to aid in the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. It might be that stressful life situations could affect the immune system, allowing for the expression and/or exacerbation of psoriatic arthritis. However, precisely how these emotional issues are related to psoriatic arthritis has not been established.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The type of psoriatic arthritis depends on the distribution of the joints affected. Accordingly, there are five types of psoriatic arthritis: symmetrical polyarthritis (both sides of the body), asymmetric oligoarticular, spondylitis, distal interphalangeal joints, and arthritis mutilans.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_psoriatic_arthritis_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most patients, the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. There can be tiny pitting nail changes of the finger and toenails. The type of psoriatic arthritis depends on the distribution of the joints affected. Accordingly, there are five types of psoriatic arthritis: symmetrical, asymmetric and few joints, spondylitis, distal interphalangeal joints, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">arthritis mutilans</a>.</p>.<p>The arthritis frequently involves the knees, ankles, and joints in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>. Usually, only a few joints are inflamed at a time. The inflamed joints become painful, stiff, swollen, hot, tender, and red. There is usually loss of range of motion of the involved joints. Sometimes, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">joint inflammation</a> in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit (dactylitis), giving them a sausage-like appearance. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_stiffness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Joint stiffness</a> is a common symptom and is typically worse early in the morning. Less commonly, psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion, mimicking the pattern seen in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sacrum</a> (sacroiliitis), causing other symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pain</a> and stiffness in the low back, buttocks, neck, and upper back. Occasionally, psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. A very destructive, though less common, form of arthritis called "mutilans" can cause rapid joint damage. Fortunately, this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis.</p>.<p>Patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis), tendon insertion points on bone (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enthesitis_and_enthesopathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enthesitis</a>, inflammation of the entheses), and around cartilage. Inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes Achilles tendinitis, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">walking</a> and climbing stairs. Inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a>, as seen in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/costochondritis_and_tietze_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">costochondritis</a>.</p>.<p>Aside from arthritis and spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis can cause symptoms likeÂ <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a> and inflammation in other organs, such as the eyes, lungs, and aorta. Inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">iris</a>) causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">iritis</a>, a painful health condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Corticosteroids</a> injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a>.

Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">aortic</a> valves, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a> and shortness of breath.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Acne</a> and nail changes are symptoms commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. Pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Onycholysis, or separation of the nail bed, may also occur. Interestingly, these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_visual_dictionary_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Acne</a> has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. In fact, a syndrome exists that features inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">acne</a>, pustules on the feet or palms, thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis), and bone inflammation (osteitis). This syndrome is, therefore, named by the eponym <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sapho_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">SAPHO syndrome</a>.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_treat_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psoriatic arthritis is generally treated by rheumatologists, health specialists in diagnosing and treating arthritis and autoimmune diseases. Other doctors who may be involved in the care of patients with psoriatic arthritis include dermatologists and primary-care doctors, including family and general practitioners and internal medicine specialists. When surgical treatment is needed for severe joint disease, orthopedic surgeons can be consulted. Other health care givers can include occupational and physical therapists.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_a_health_care_professional_diagnose_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psoriatic arthritis is a diagnosis made mainly on clinical grounds, based on the finding of psoriasis and the typical inflammatory arthritis of the spine and/or other joints. There is no laboratory test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Blood tests such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sedimentation rate</a> may show an abnormal elevated result and merely reflect presence of inflammation in the joints and other organs of the body. Other blood tests, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_factor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">rheumatoid factor</a>, are obtained to exclude <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. When one or two large joints (such a knees) are inflamed, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_aspiration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">arthrocentesis</a> can be performed. Arthrocentesis is an office procedure whereby a sterile needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) fluid from the inflamed joints. The fluid is then analyzed for inflammation, infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gout</a> crystals, and other inflammatory conditions. X-rays may show changes of cartilage or bone injury indicative of arthritis of the spine, sacroiliac joints, and/or joints of the hands. Typical X-ray findings include bony erosions resulting from arthritis, but these may not be present in early disease. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> scanning is sometimes used to identify early erosion of joints. The blood test for the genetic marker HLA-B27, mentioned above, is often performed. This marker can be found in over 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have spine inflammation.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The medical treatment of the arthritis aspects of psoriatic arthritis is described below. The treatment of psoriasis and the other involved organs is beyond the scope of this article.</p>.<p>Generally, the treatment of arthritis in psoriatic arthritis involves a combination of anti-inflammatory medications (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a>. If progressive inflammation and joint destruction occur despite NSAIDs treatment, more potent medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">methotrexate</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Rheumatrex</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Trexall</a>), corticosteroids, and antimalarial medications (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxychloroquine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">hydroxychloroquine</a> [Plaquenil]) are used.</p>.<p>Exercise programs can be done at home or with a physical therapist and are customized according to the disease and physical capabilities of each patient. Warm-up stretching, or other techniques, such as a hot shower or heat applications are helpful to relax muscles prior to exercise. Ice application after the routine can help minimize post-exercise soreness and inflammation. In general, exercises for arthritis are performed for the purpose of strengthening and maintaining or improving joint range of motion. They should be done on a regular basis for best results.</p>.<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> (NSAIDs) are a group of medications that are helpful in reducing joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness.

Newer NSAIDs called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cox-2_inhibitors/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">COX-2 inhibitors</a> (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/celecoxib/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">celecoxib</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/celecoxib/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Celebrex</a>]) cause gastrointestinal problems less frequently.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="disease-modifying_antirheumatic_drugs_dmards_for_psoriatic_arthritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients who experience progressive joint destruction in spite of NSAIDs are candidates for more aggressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Disease-modifying medications are important to prevent progressive joint destruction and deformity. These drugs include methotrexate, which is used orally or can be given by injection on a weekly basis for psoriatic arthritis as well as for psoriasis alone. It can cause bone-marrow suppression, as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> damage with long-term use. Regular monitoring of blood counts and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_blood_tests/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">liver blood tests</a> should be performed during therapy with methotrexate.</p>.<p>Antimalarial medication, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), is also used for persistent psoriatic arthritis. Its potential side effects include injury to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">retina</a> of the eye.

Patients with psoriasis can benefit by direct sunlight exposure and are often treated with direct ultraviolet light therapy.</p>.<p>Finally, patients who have severe destruction of the joints may be candidates for orthopedic surgical repair. Total hip joint replacement and total <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/knee_joint_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">knee joint</a> replacement surgery are now commonplace in community hospitals throughout the United States.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_psoriatic_arthritis_complications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psoriatic arthritis can be complicated by issues within the skin or the joints. The skin of psoriasis can become infected and require antibiotic treatments. The joints can become destroyed, deformed, and functionless. With aggressive medical treatment, however, these complications are generally avoidable. Psoriatic arthritis with eye, bowel, lung, or heart-valve inflammation can be complicated by disease in these areas.
