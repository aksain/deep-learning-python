peripheral arteries (blood vessels outside your heart) also may develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerosis</a>, the build-up of fat and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a> deposits, called plaque, on the inside walls. Over time, the build-up narrows the artery. Eventually the narrowed artery causes less blood to flow and a condition called "ischemia" can occur. Ischemia is inadequate blood flow to the body's tissue.</p>.<p><b><a name="aneurysm" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel.

atherosclerosis of the renal arteries (see above). It occurs in people with generalized vascular disease. Less often, renal artery disease can be caused by a congenital (present at birth) abnormal development of the tissue that makes up the renal arteries.

Certain occupational exposures bring on Raynaud's. The episodes produce temporary lack of blood supply to the area, causing the skin to appear white or bluish and cold or numb. In some cases, the symptoms of Raynaud's may be related to underlying diseases (ie, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lupus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scleroderma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scleroderma</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="buergers_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Buerger's disease most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves.

When your muscles contract, the valves open and blood moves through the veins. When your muscles relax, the valves close, keeping blood flowing in one direction through the veins.</p>.<p>If the valves inside your veins become damaged, the valves may not close completely. This allows blood to flow in both directions. When your muscles relax, the valves inside the damaged vein(s) will not be able to hold the blood. This can cause pooling of blood or swelling in the veins. The veins bulge and appear as ropes under the skin.
