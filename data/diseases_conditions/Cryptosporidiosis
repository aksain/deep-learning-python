Davis, MD, PhD</a></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_cryptosporidiosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease caused by microscopic parasites, <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, that can live in the intestine of humans and animals and is passed in the stool of an infected person or animal. Both the disease and the parasite are commonly known as "Crypto." The parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it very resistant to chlorine-based disinfectants. During the past 2 decades, Crypto has become recognized as one of the most common causes of waterborne disease (recreational water and drinking water) in humans in the United States. The parasite is found in every region of the United States and throughout the world.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_cryptosporidiosis_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> lives in the intestine of infected humans or animals. An infected person or animal sheds Crypto parasites in the stool. Millions of Crypto germs can be released in a bowel movement from an infected human or animal. Shedding of Crypto in the stool begins when the symptoms begin and can last for weeks after the symptoms (e.g., <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>) stop. You can become infected after accidentally swallowing the parasite. <i>Cryptosporidium</i> may be found in soil, food, water, or surfaces that have been contaminated with the feces from infected humans or animals. Crypto is not spread by contact with blood.</p>.<p>Crypto can be spread:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_cryptosporidiosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common symptom of cryptosporidiosis is watery <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a>. Other symptoms include:</p>.<p>Some people with Crypto will have no symptoms at all. While the small intestine is the site most commonly affected, Crypto infections could possibly affect other areas of the digestive tract or the respiratory tract.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_after_infection_do_symptoms_appear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of cryptosporidiosis generally begin 2 to 10 days (average 7 days) after becoming infected with the parasite.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_will_symptoms_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In persons with healthy immune systems, symptoms usually last about 1 to 2 weeks. The symptoms may go in cycles in which you may seem to get better for a few days, then feel worse again before the illness ends.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_most_at_risk_for_cryptosporidiosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who are most likely to become infected with <i>Cryptosporidium</i> include:</p>.<p>Contaminated water may include water that has not been boiled or filtered, as well as contaminated recreational water sources (e.g., swimming pools, lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams). Several community-wide outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been linked to drinking municipal water or recreational water contaminated with <i>Cryptosporidium</i>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_most_at_risk_for_getting_seriously_ill_with_cryptosporidiosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have a severely weakened immune system, talk to your health care provider for additional guidance.</p>.<p>Although Crypto can infect all people, some groups are likely to develop more serious illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_i_think_i_may_have_cryptosporidiosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you suspect that you have cryptosporidiosis, see your health care provider.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_cryptosporidiosis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your health care provider will ask you to submit stool samples to see if you are infected. Because testing for Crypto can be difficult, you may be asked to submit several stool specimens over several days. Tests for Crypto are not routinely done in most laboratories. Therefore, your health care provider should specifically request testing for the parasite.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_cryptosporidiosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitazoxanide-oral_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Nitazoxanide</a> has been FDA-approved for treatment of diarrhea caused by <i>Cryptosporidium</i> in people with healthy immune systems and is available by prescription. Consult with your health care provider for more information. Most people who have healthy immune systems will recover without treatment. Diarrhea can be managed by drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Young children and pregnant women may be more susceptible to dehydration. Rapid loss of fluids from diarrhea may be especially life threatening to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a>. Therefore, parents should talk to their health care provider about fluid replacement therapy options for infants. Anti-diarrheal medicine may help slow down diarrhea, but a health care provider should be consulted before such medicine is taken.</p>.<p>People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems are at higher risk for more severe and more prolonged illness. The effectiveness of nitazoxanide in immunosuppressed individuals is unclear. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a>-positive individuals who suspect they have Crypto should contact their health care provider. For persons with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">AIDS</a>, anti-retroviral therapy that improves immune status will also decrease or eliminate symptoms of Crypto. However, even if symptoms disappear, cryptosporidiosis is often not curable and the symptoms may return if the immune status worsens.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="i_have_been_diagnosed_with_cryptosporidiosis_should_i_worry_about_spreading_the_infection_to_others" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, <i>Cryptosporidium</i> can be very <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a>.
