<p>Itch is an irritation in the skin that elicits an urge to scratch. Itchiness is a problem that everyone experiences, and the symptom can be localized (limited to one area of the body) or generalized (occurring all over the body or in several different areas). Sometimes, depending upon the underlying cause, itching may be worse at night. In medical terminology, itching is known as <i>pruritus</i>.</p>.<p>Generalized itch that occurs all over the body is often more difficult to treat than localized itch. Itches can also occur with or without skin lesions (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>, redness, or abnormalities that can be seen on the skin). An itch that is accompanied by a visible skin abnormality should be evaluated by a physician and, in some cases, by a dermatologist since the problem is likely to be a condition that requires specialized medical treatment (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scabies/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scabies</a>, etc.).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Depending upon the underlying cause, itchiness may be associated with other symptoms and signs. Most commonly, these associated findings include skin lesions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blisters</a>, bumps, or redness of the affected area. Dryness of the skin is a common cause of itch. Itching of skin can lead to tears in the skin (excoriations) from scratching. Less commonly, generalized itching all over the body can be a sign of chronic medical conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver disease</a>. In these situations, there may be no changes to the appearance of the skin.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Pruritus can be caused by many conditions. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Stress</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a>, or other emotional problems can cause itching. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Stress</a> also can aggravate itch from other causes. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_skin_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Dry skin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/xerosis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">xerosis</a>) is perhaps the most frequent cause of itch without a rash.

Some common causes like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dry skin</a> or sunburn may be obvious, while causes such as chronic systemic diseases or conditions may require blood or imaging tests to identify.

Nevertheless, many common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rashes</a> and skin ailments have a characteristic symptom or appearance that may suggest the correct diagnosis.</p>.<p>Because the causes of itchy skin are so varied, many different medical practitioners can be involved in treating itching. Itching is commonly treated by specialists in family medicine, internal medicine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pediatrics</a>, or dermatology. Itching related to allergy may be treated by an allergist or immunologist. Itching related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">STDs</a> may be managed by a gynecologist or urologist. An obstetrician-gynecologist may treat women suffering from itching during pregnancy or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginitis_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vaginitis</a>. People with itching due to chronic diseases may be treated by the specialists who manage these conditions, such as endocrinologists, gastorenterologists, nephrologists, oncologists, hematologists, neurologists, and infectious-disease specialists. Some causes of itching are treated by emergency-medicine specialists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Itching usually prompts scratching, which can sometimes lead to a vicious itch-scratch cycle. Scratching can initially feel satisfying, but prolonged scratching just leaves you with irritated skin that can still itch and often worsens the itching itself. Since scratching provides only temporary relief and doesn't promote healing of the underlying problem, it is best to avoid scratching if at all possible. If scratching breaks open the skin, bacterial infection can set in. This is known as secondary infection. And if scratching continues for many months or years, the area that is scratched may develop thickened skin (lichenification) or pigmentation that darkens the area.</p>.<p>The best way to allow irritated skin to heal is to stop scratching it. However, willpower often is not enough since the urge to scratch can be compelling. The following sections discuss some general measures and home remedies to help to stop scratching and control itch, regardless of the cause.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Topical itch treatments, those used on the skin, include cold applications, creams, and lotions.</p>.<p><b>Cold applications</b>: Because cold and itch travel along the same nerve fibers, the use of cold can "jam the circuits" and deaden itch. Methods of applying cold include the following:</p>.<p><b>Hot water</b> (in the shower, for instance) feels good temporarily, but it can leave you feeling even itchier later. Therefore, the use of hot water is not recommended.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>You can apply these products over and over, every few minutes if needed. These preparations help numb the nerve endings and stop you from a frenzy of scratching, which leaves the skin raw, sore, and even itchier.</p>.<p>Although hydrocortisone-containing creams and lotions are often promoted as itch reducers, this ingredient only helps an itch that is caused by a rash responsive to cortisone, such as the skin diseases <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_atopic_dermatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eczema</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seborrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seborrhea</a>. Since OTC <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocortisone_valerate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">hydrocortisone</a>-containing creams and lotions are weak (even so-called "maximum-strength" products contain only 1%), they aren't too helpful for itch even in responsive conditions. When pruritus is caused by irritations of other sorts (insect bites, for instance), hydrocortisone doesn't help much at all. If you use hydrocortisone for 10 days and experience no improvement, you should go see a physician to help determine the cause of your itch.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Traditionally, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a> are used to treat itch. Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">hydroxyzine</a> (Atarax), and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton and others). These medicines can induce drowsiness in many people and must be used with care before driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Although antihistamines may help relieve itchy skin, they seem to do so mainly by helping people fall asleep and avoid scratching at night. If falling or staying asleep is not your main problem, you may want to try one of the nonsedating antihistamines. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loratadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Loratadine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loratadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Claritin</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fexofenadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">fexofenadine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fexofenadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Allegra</a> and others) are examples of newer second-generation antihistamines that are available without a prescription. The second-generation antihistamines do not have the sedating effects of the older first-generation antihistamines but they are not very effective in quelling the itch.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Itching can be prevented only to the extent that the underlying cause(s) of the itching sensation can be prevented. For example, careful use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunscreen</a> products can prevent the itching associated with sunburn. Keeping well hydrated and using moisturizers can prevent the itch associated with dry skin. It is also possible to take preventive measures to avoid contagious conditions that may be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact like sexually transmitted diseases, or tick or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bug_bites_and_stings/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bug bites</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_lice/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lice</a> infestations that may be the sources of itching. Itching associated with serious conditions like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin cancers</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> or kidney disease cannot typically be prevented.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>If home treatment isn't helping, scratching is affecting the skin being scratched (infection, lichenification [thickening and scarring], or pigmentation), or the itch is disturbing one's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>, consult a doctor to ascertain what's causing the itching. A doctor can also prescribe stronger cortisone-based creams (for eczemas and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergies</a>) and prescription-grade antihistamines, if necessary, or treat the underlying condition that is causing the itch.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>As mentioned previously, a secondary bacterial infection of the skin is perhaps the most common complication of itching. This occurs not as a result of the itch but as a result of the scratching and associated skin damage. Antibiotics may be required to treat a bacterial infection of the skin. Itching itself is unlikely to lead to other complications, although some of the underlying diseases that cause itching (see above) are associated with complications specific to the disease itself.</p>.<p>Itching itself is not associated with long-term skin problems or harm, and most cases of itch are temporary and resolve on their own or with topical or oral treatments. Itching that is associated with a serious condition may persist if the condition worsens or it may be managed with medications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
