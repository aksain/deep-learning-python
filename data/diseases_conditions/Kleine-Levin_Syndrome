<p><b><a name="what_is_kleine-levin_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disorder that primarily affects adolescent 
males (approximately 70 percent of those with Kleine-Levin syndrome are male). 
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_kleine-levin_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is characterized by recurring but reversible periods of excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> (up 
to 20 hours per day). Symptoms occur as "episodes," typically lasting a few days 
to a few weeks. </p>.<p>Episode onset is often abrupt, and may be associated with 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu</a>-like symptoms. Excessive food intake, irritability, childishness, 
disorientation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hallucinations</a>, and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive may be 
observed during episodes. Mood can be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depressed</a> as a consequence, but not a 
cause, of the disorder. Affected individuals are completely normal between 
episodes, although they may not be able to remember afterwards everything that 
happened during the episode. It may be weeks or more before symptoms reappear. 
Symptoms may be related to malfunction of the hypothalamus and thalamus, parts 
of the brain that govern appetite and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_treatment_for_kleine-levin_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no definitive treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome and watchful 
waiting at home, rather than pharmacotherapy, is most often advised. Stimulant 
pills, including amphetamines, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">methylphenidate</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/modafinil/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">modafinil</a>, are used to treat 
sleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitive 
abnormalities. Because of similarities between Kleine-Levin syndrome and certain 
mood disorders, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lithium/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lithium</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/carbamazepine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">carbamazepine</a> may be prescribed and, in some cases, 
have been shown to prevent further episodes. This disorder should be 
differentiated from cyclic re-occurrence of sleepiness during the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premenstrual</a> 
period in teen-aged girls, which may be controlled with 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth control pills</a>. It 
also should be differentiated from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">encephalopathy</a>, recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, or 
psychosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_kleine-levin_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Episodes eventually decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of
