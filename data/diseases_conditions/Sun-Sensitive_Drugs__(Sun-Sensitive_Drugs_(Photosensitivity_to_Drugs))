<p><b><a name="sun-sensitizing_drugs_photosensitivity_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_photosensitivity_sun_sensitivity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Photosensitivity (or sun sensitivity) is inflammation of the skin induced by the combination of sunlight and certain medications or substances. This causes redness of the skin and may look similar to sunburn. Both the photosensitizing medication or chemical and light source have to be present in order for a photosensitivity reaction to occur.</p>.<p>Generally, these reactions can be divided into two mechanisms:</p>.<p>Phototoxic drugs are much more common than photoallergic drugs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_difference_between_a_photoallergic_and_a_phototoxic_reaction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In phototoxic reactions, the drug may become activated by exposure to sunlight and cause damage to the skin. The skin's appearance resembles sunburn, and the process is generally acute (has a fast onset). Ultraviolet A (UVA) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a> is most commonly associated with phototoxicity, but ultraviolet B (UVB) and visible light may also contribute to this reaction.</p>.<p>Rash from a phototoxic reaction is mainly confined to the sun-exposed area of the skin. A phototoxic reaction typically clears up once the drug is discontinued and has been cleared from the body, even after re-exposure to light.</p>.<p>In photoallergic reactions, the ultraviolet exposure changes the structure of the drug so that is seen by the body's immune system as an invader (antigen). The immune system initiates an allergic response and cause inflammation of the skin in the sun-exposed areas. These usually resemble <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_atopic_dermatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eczema</a> and are generally chronic (long-lasting). Many drugs in this family are topical drugs.</p>.<p>This type of photosensitivity may recur after sun exposure even after the drug has cleared from the system and can sometimes spread to areas of the skin unexposed to the sun.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_sun_sensitivity_photosensitivity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Symptoms of phototoxic reaction</b></p>.<p>Individuals with phototoxic reactions may initially complain of a burning and stinging sensation. Redness typically occurs within 24 hours of the exposure to sun in the exposed areas of the body such as the forehead, nose, hands, arms, and lips. In severe cases, sun protected areas of skin may be also be involved.</p>.<p>The range of skin damage may vary from mild redness to swelling to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blister</a> formation in more severe cases. The rash from this photosensitivity reaction usually resolves with peeling and sloughing of (shedding) skin in the affected area within several days.</p>.<p>Individuals with photoallergic reactions may initially complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a>. This is then followed by redness and possibly swelling and eruption in the involved area. Because this is considered type of an allergic reaction, there may be no symptoms for many days when the drug is taken for the first time. Subsequent exposure to the drug and the sun may cause a more rapid response in 1-2 days.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/phytophotodermatitis_hyperpigmentation_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Hyperpigmentation</a> (darkening) of the affected area of the skin may develop after the resolution of a phototoxicity reaction, but it is rare in a photoallergic reaction. In phototoxic reactions, high doses of the drug and long exposures to light may be required to cause the reaction.</p>.<p>Yes. Ultraviolet (UV) light is radiation energy in the form of invisible light waves. UV light is emitted by the sun and by tanning lamps. The sun discharges three types of ultraviolet radiation,</p>.<p>Only UVA and UVB rays reach earth. (UVC does not penetrate the earth's upper atmosphere.) Tanning lamps also produce UVA and/or UVB. These artificial rays affect the skin in the same way as do UVA and UVB from the sun.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="photoallergic_and_phototoxic_reaction_pictures" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="list_of_examples_of_medications_that_cause_phototoxicitcy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Common <b>phototoxic drugs</b> include:</p>.<p>For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/terbinafine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">terbinafine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/terbinafine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lamisil</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itraconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">itraconazole</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itraconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sporanox</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/voriconazole-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">voriconazole</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/voriconazole-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Vfend</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/griseofulvin-oral_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">griseofulvin</a> (Gris-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/percutaneous_endoscopic_gastrostomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PEG</a>)</p>.<p><b><a name="list_of_examples_of_drugs_that_cause_photoallergic_reactions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Examples of some of the common photoallergic drugs include:</p>.<p>These are only some of the common sun-sensitizing drugs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_foods_and_plants_cause_sun_sensitivity_photosensitivity_reactions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some vegetables and plants may cause sun sensitivity if they come into contact with the skin.

It is important to ask when the medication was started and for how long the symptoms persisted.</p>.<p>There are no diagnostic tests available, although a photo-patch test may be performed. This test is typically performed by a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the skin) by shining light onto different areas of the skin to see how long it will take for the light to cause redness. This test may be useful in evaluating photosensitivity to topical medications causing a photoallergic response. In cases of phototoxicity reactions, this test is generally not useful.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_photosensitizing_drug_reaction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recognizing and discontinuing the photosensitizing drug is the most important step in treatment. In general, the usual sunburn prevention methods such as the use of sunscreens and avoidance of prolonged exposure to sun are important steps to take. Keeping the area of skin eruption moist and applying wet dressings may help relieve the symptoms. The reaction may last up to a few weeks.</p>.<p>Topical steroid creams may be helpful in treating the redness, and antihistamines are generally helpful in minimizing the itching. In severe cases, a short course (10-14 days) of oral steroids, under the direction of a doctor, may be used.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_anyone_taking_these_drugs_at_risk_for_developing_sunburn" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Not everyone taking any of these drugs will develop photosensitivity reactions.

Briefly, this treatment takes advantage of activating a photosensitizing drug (such as 5-aminolevulinic acid) by shining light directly onto it for a short time. The drug is first applied to the area of the skin where the cancer or pre-cancer is found. With light-induced activation of the drug, the abnormal cells (cancer or pre-cancer) are destroyed preferentially.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
