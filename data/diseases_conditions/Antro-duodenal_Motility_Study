Such abnormal function usually is suspected when there are symptoms and signs of obstruction to or delayed flow of food through the stomach and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a>. These symptoms usually are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, and intestinal distention (enlargement). The obstruction is a direct result of the inability of the abnormally functioning muscles to propel food through the stomach and intestines. One common cause of motility disorders of the stomach and intestines is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes mellitus</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_an_antro-duodenal_motility_study_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_results_of_an_antro-duodenal_motility_study_evaluated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p> Normally, there are characteristic patterns of contraction of the stomach and duodenum during fasting periods and after meals. In patients with motility problems of the stomach and/or small intestine, the characteristic patterns are abnormal or completely absent. Such patients may be treated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> to stimulate contraction, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metoclopramide/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metoclopramide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metoclopramide/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Reglan</a>). </p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_any_side_effects_to_an_antro-duodenal_motility_study" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no important side effects; however, the tube can become quite irritating after several hours, giving the patient a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>. Occasionally, the tube also causes nasal irritation.  Within 24 hours after the tube is removed, the irritation disappears.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_any_alternatives_to_an_antro-duodenal_motility_study" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Other tests can help with the evaluation of motility disorders, including upper gastrointestinal X-rays, gastric emptying studies, and electrogastrograms. The most recent device for determining gastrointestinal motility is a radiotelemetry capsule (Smartpill) that senses the pressure generated when the stomach or intestinal muscles contract around it.  The capsule is swallowed, and it then travels through the stomach and intestines.  While it is traveling, it continually senses the pressure around it and transmits this information wirelessly to a receiver worn on the outside of the body.  Later, the data is downloaded from the recorder and analyzed.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
