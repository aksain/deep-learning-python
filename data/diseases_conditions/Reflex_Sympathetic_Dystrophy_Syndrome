RSD is also referred to as "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complex_regional_pain_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">complex regional pain syndrome</a>," "the shoulder-hand syndrome," "causalgia," and "Sudeck's atrophy."<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_rsd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact mechanism of how RSD develops is poorly understood. The theories include irritation and abnormal excitation of nervous tissue, leading to abnormal impulses along nerves that affect blood vessels and skin. The involuntary nervous system, peripheral nerves, and brain seem to be involved.</p>.<p>A variety of events can trigger the RSD, including:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_rsd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The onset of RSD symptoms may be rapid or gradual. The condition may not display all features. It is bilateral (involving both sides of the body) in up to half of people with RSD. There are several stages of RSD with symptoms that include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_rsd_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>RSD is diagnosed based on the clinical features described previously. Blood tests are not abnormal because of RSD, though the associated triggering events mentioned previously may lead to abnormalities in laboratory testing. Plain film X-ray testing and MRI scanning can show patchy thinning or significant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">osteoporosis</a>. Nuclear bone scanning can show characteristic uptake patterns.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_rsd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Response to treatment of RSD is greater in the earlier stages of the condition than in the later stages. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_rsd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (outlook) and response to treatment in patients with RSD is unpredictable. As previously mentioned, instituting treatment early in the course of the condition leads to better outcomes.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_rsd_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is some evidence that early immobilization of patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attack</a> can help decrease the chances of developing RSD. Also, there have been studies demonstrating a decrease in the risk of developing RSD in patients with bony fractures using daily <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascorbic_acid-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Vitamin C</a> supplementation. <span id="cntid"></span></p>
