<p><b><a name="intro" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>So you want to improve the appearance of your lips? You've got your reasons. Plumping your pucker often improves self-confidence and sexual confidence.</p>.<p>The good news is that you have many options to improve the appearance of your lips. The methods we discuss here also reduce fine lines and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wrinkles/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wrinkles</a> around your lips. It's important to be realistic, too. Injections or implants can enhance and improve your natural look, but they're not about performing miracles. </p>.<p><b><a name="who" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You must be in good general health overall. You are not a good candidate for lip augmentation if you have: 
</p>.<p>Like any other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic_surgery_cosmetic_surgery/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cosmetic surgery</a>, lip augmentation requires a lot of responsibility. You can only determine for yourself if you're ready. We've included the most popular injections and implants here. This information should serve as a general overview only and should not replace your doctor's advice. Once you've selected a doctor, you will communicate with him or her and decide together which option best suits your needs. </p>.<p> As with any medical procedure, you should tell your doctor of any <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a> or any medications that you are taking and you will be required to discuss your medical history. Certain diseases 
such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> can increase your chances of complications. If you are a 
smoker, this may also be a complicating factor.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="injections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your surgeon will most likely use topical anesthesia (painkiller applied directly to the lips) for injections. These are performed on an outpatient basis in your doctor's office or an outpatient center and you will be sent home the same day.</p>.<p> Here are the options: 
</p>.<p><b><a name="surgeries" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
You will most likely receive local anesthesia if you get a lip implant or have lip augmentation surgery. A procedure can take up to two hours at your doctor's office or outpatient center, depending on the complexity, and you will be sent home the same day.</p>.<p>Here are the options:</p>.<p>Your surgeon may also be able to make an incision along the upper line of your lip.</p>.<p><b><a name="recovery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
It's important that you have someone with you who can drive you home after a lip augmentation procedure.</p>.<p>If you are having surgical implants or grafts, your recovery can take up to two weeks after the surgery.</p>.<p>It's important that you know yourself. Discuss how much time you think you'll need for recovery with your doctor. It may be necessary to take some time off work. You will need at least three days off from work, at minimum. If you are physically active, you will not be able to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> for a few days after injections and perhaps for a few weeks after surgical implants. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="prepare" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's important that you have someone with you who can drive you home from the operation.</p>.<p>If you are a smoker, you may be required to stop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> for a period before the procedure. You should follow your doctor's instructions carefully on this.</p>.<p>Make sure you wear loose, comfortable clothing. Be especially mindful of the shirt or blouse you choose to wear that day. It should be button down, if possible, so you do not have to pull it over your face.</p>.<p>You should not take <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a> or painkillers like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ibuprofen</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Motrin</a> before having the procedure.</p>.<p><b>Before Your Procedure, Establish a Home Recovery Area With the Following:</b></p>.<p><b><a name="risks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As with any surgery, there are risks and complications. You can have allergic reactions to implants as we've described above or 
an allergic reaction to anesthesia.</p>.<p>You can experience bleeding or an implant that hardens, which may require removal. You also risk infection or perhaps even nerve damage in some cases. It's very important that you discuss any concerns with your doctor prior to surgery and that you make your doctor aware of any existing medical conditions which may cause further complications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="doctor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="insurance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Insurance may cover lip augmentation if the procedure is being completed for reconstructive purposes, such as a congenital defect or as reconstruction after an injury or accident. However, if you are undergoing this procedure purely for cosmetic purposes, you're most likely on your own to pay the bill. Make sure you understand all of your doctor's charges, including anesthesia, follow-up care and hospital fees, if applicable. Obtain an estimate of the charges beforehand and work out a payment plan if necessary.</p>.<p>It's also very important that you realize elective <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_surgery_before_after_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cosmetic surgery</a> may impact your current insurance. Your carrier can increase your premiums and it can affect future coverage. Ask your insurance carrier about its policy on elective, cosmetic surgery so you're not surprised in the future.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
