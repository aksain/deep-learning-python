It can also harm healthy cells that divide quickly, such as those that line your mouth and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a> or cause your hair to grow. Damage to healthy cells may cause side effects. Often, side effects get better or go away after chemotherapy is over.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_chemotherapy_do" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, chemotherapy can:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_chemotherapy_used" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sometimes, chemotherapy is used as the only cancer treatment. More often, you will get chemotherapy along with surgery, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation therapy</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/biological_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">biological therapy</a>.

No matter where you go for chemotherapy, your doctor and nurse will watch for side effects and make any needed drug changes.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_often_will_i_receive_chemotherapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment schedules for chemotherapy vary widely. How often and how long you get chemotherapy depends on:</p>.<p>You may receive chemotherapy in cycles. A cycle is a period of chemotherapy treatment followed by a period of rest. For instance, you might receive 1 week of chemotherapy followed by 3 weeks of rest. These 4 weeks make up one cycle. The rest period gives your body a chance to build new healthy cells.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_i_miss_a_dose_of_chemotherapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is not good to skip a chemotherapy treatment. Sometimes your doctor or nurse may change your chemotherapy schedule. This can be due to side effects you are having. If this happens, your doctor or nurse will explain what to do and when to start treatment again.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_chemotherapy_given" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chemotherapy may be given in many ways.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is often given through a thin needle that is placed in a vein on your hand or lower arm. Your nurse will put the needle in at the start of each treatment and remove it when treatment is over. Let your doctor or nurse know right away if you feel <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or burning while you are getting IV chemotherapy.</p>.<p>IV chemotherapy is often given through catheters or ports, sometimes with the help of a pump.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_will_i_feel_during_chemotherapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chemotherapy affects people in different ways. How you feel depends on how healthy you are before treatment, your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the kind of chemotherapy you are getting, and the dose. Doctors and nurses cannot know for certain how you will feel during chemotherapy.</p>.<p>Some people do not feel well right after chemotherapy. The most common side effect is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, feeling exhausted and worn out.

Whether or not you can work may depend on what kind of work you do. If your job allows, you may want to see if you can work part-time or work from home on days you do not feel well.</p>.<p>Many employers are required by law to change your work schedule to meet your needs during cancer treatment. Talk with your employer about ways to adjust your work during chemotherapy. You can learn more about these laws by talking with a social worker.</p>.<p>Sometimes your doctor may advise you not to work from a period of time, such 
as when your immune system is low during chemotherapy.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_i_take_over-the-counter_and_prescription_drugs_while_i_get_chemotherapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This depends on the type of chemotherapy you get and the other types of drugs you plan to take. Take only drugs that are approved by your doctor or nurse. Tell your doctor or nurse about all the over-the-counter and prescription drugs you take, including laxatives, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergy</a> medicines, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> medicines, pain relievers, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ibuprofen</a>.</p>.<p>One way to let your doctor or nurse know about these drugs is by bringing in all your pill bottles. Your doctor or nurse needs to know:</p>.<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you take any over-the-counter or prescription drugs, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">minerals</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dietary supplements</a>, or herbs.</p>.<p>Some of these products can change how chemotherapy works. For this reason, it is important to tell your doctor or nurse about all the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamins</a>, minerals, dietary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a>, and herbs that you take before you start chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, talk with your doctor before you take any of these products.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_will_i_know_if_my_chemotherapy_is_working" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor will give you physical exams and medical tests (such as blood tests and x-rays). He or she will also ask you how you feel.</p>.<p>You cannot tell if chemotherapy is working based on its side effects. Some people think that severe side effects mean that chemotherapy is working well. Or that no side effects mean that chemotherapy is not working. The truth is that side effects have nothing to do with how well chemotherapy is fighting your cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_much_does_chemotherapy_cost" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is hard to say how much chemotherapy will cost. It depends on:</p>.<p>Talk with your health insurance plan about what costs it will pay for. Questions to ask include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_clinical_trials_and_are_they_an_option_for_me" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer clinical trials (also called cancer treatment studies or research studies) test new treatments for people with cancer. These can be studies of new types of chemotherapy, other types of treatment, or new ways to combine treatments. The goal of all these clinical trials is to find better ways to help people with cancer.</p>.<p>Your doctor or nurse may suggest you take part in a clinical trial. You can also suggest the idea. Before you agree to be in a clinical trial, learn about:</p>.<p><b><a name="tips_for_meeting_with_your_doctor_or_nurse" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="your_feelings_during_chemotherapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>At some point during chemotherapy, you may feel:</p>.<p>It is normal to have a wide range of feelings while going through chemotherapy. After all, living with cancer and getting treatment can be stressful. You may also feel fatigue, which can make it harder to cope with your feelings.</p>.<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse about things that worry or upset you. You may want to ask about seeing a counselor. Your doctor may also suggest that you take medication if you find it very hard to cope with your feelings.</p>.<p>It is normal to have a wide range of feelings while going through chemotherapy. After all, living with cancer and getting treatment can be stressful.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="chemotherapy_side_effects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Side effects are problems caused by cancer treatment. Some common side effects from chemotherapy are fatigue, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, decreased blood cell counts, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hair loss</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/canker_sores/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mouth sores</a>, and pain.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is designed to kill fast-growing cancer cells. But it can also affect healthy cells that grow quickly. These include cells that line your mouth and intestines, cells in your bone marrow that make blood cells, and cells that make your hair grow. Chemotherapy causes side effects when it harms these healthy cells.</p>.<p>You may have a lot of side effects, some, or none at all. This depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts. Before you start chemotherapy, talk with your doctor or nurse about which side effects to expect.</p>.<p>How long side effects last depends on your health and the kind of chemotherapy you get. Most side effects go away after chemotherapy is over. But sometimes it can take months or even years for them to go away.</p>.<p>Sometimes, chemotherapy causes long-term side effects that do not go away. These may include damage to your heart, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>, nerves, kidneys, or reproductive organs. Some types of chemotherapy may cause a second cancer years later. Ask your doctor or nurse about your chance of having long-term side effects.</p>.<p>Doctors have many ways to prevent or treat chemotherapy side effects and help you heal after each treatment session. Talk with your doctor or nurse about which ones to expect and what to do about them. Make sure to let your doctor or nurse know about any changes you notice - they may be signs of a side effect.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
