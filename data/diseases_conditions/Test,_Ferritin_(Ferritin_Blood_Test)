<p>Ferritin is the major iron storage protein of the body. Ferritin levels can be used to indirectly measure the iron levels in the body. Ferritin has the shape of a hollow sphere that permits the entry of a variable amount of iron for storage (as ferric hydroxide phosphate complexes).</p>.<p>The ferritin test uses venous blood to measure ferritin levels. The test is sometimes ordered together with other tests to help evaluate the body's iron stores, such as an iron level or a total iron binding capacity test.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The ferritin test uses venous blood that is withdrawn as for any routine blood test. No special preparation for the test is necessary. Fasting is not necessary.</p>.<p>A needle attached to a vacuum collection device is inserted into a vein, often a vein in the antecubital fossa (crease of the elbow), after the area has been cleaned. Venous blood can also be taken from other sites.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The ferritin blood test is a routine blood test and typically does not cause side effects. Mild <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a> at the venipuncture site can occur infrequently.</p>.<p>The results may vary slightly among laboratories, but in general, normal ferritin levels range from 12 to 300 nanograms per milliliter of blood (ng/mL) for males and 12 to 150 ng/mL for females.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>High levels of ferritin can be indicative of an iron storage disorder such as hemochromatosis.</p>.<p>Hereditary hemochromatosis is an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> (genetic) disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iron_overload/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">iron overload</a>). In individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, the daily absorption of iron from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> is greater than the amount needed to replace losses. Since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body.</p>.<p>People with hereditary hemochromatosis may have no symptoms or signs (and have normal longevity), or they can have severe symptoms and signs of iron overload that include:</p>.<p>The symptoms arise because iron accumulates in the organs and leads to destruction and loss of normal function.</p>.<p>Other causes of a high ferritin level are chronic inflammatory conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver disease</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, or some types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Low levels of ferritin are seen in iron deficiency. Without enough iron, the body cannot produce sufficient levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemoglobin</a>, a component of red blood cells that allows them to carry oxygen. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Iron deficiency anemia</a> is the result.

More serious cases of anemia can produce symptoms such as:</p>
