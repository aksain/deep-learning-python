<p><b><a name="being_prepared_for_an_earthquake" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While California has been the state most 
	prone to serious earthquakes in recent years, there are many other fault 
	zones in other areas of the United States. For example, geologists and 
	seismologists have predicted a 97 percent chance of a major earthquake in 
	the New Madrid seismic zone of the central United States (including 
	Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky) between now and the year 2035. 
	While earthquakes with the power of the one that hit the greater Los Angeles 
	area in January 1994 are fairly rare, less severe earthquakes can interrupt 
	your normal living patterns and cause substantial injury. </p>.<p>During a major earthquake, you may hear a roaring or rumbling sound that 
	gradually grows louder. You may feel a rolling sensation that starts out 
	gently and, within a second or two, grows violent. </p>.<p>Or, you may first be jarred by a violent jolt. A second or two later, you may 
feel shaking and find it difficult to stand up or move from one room to another.
</p>.<p>The real key to surviving an earthquake and reducing your risk of injury lies 
in planning, preparing, and practicing what you and your family will do if it 
happens.</p>.<p><b><a name="earthquake_practice_drills" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>By planning and practicing what to do if an 
earthquake strikes, you and your family can learn to react correctly and 
automatically when the shaking begins. During an earthquake, most deaths and 
injuries are caused by collapsing building materials and heavy falling objects, 
such as bookcases, cabinets, and heating units. Learn the safe spots in each 
room of your home. If you have children, get the entire family to practice going 
to these locations. Participating in an earthquake drill will help children 
understand what to do in case you are not with them during an earthquake.</p>.<p>Make sure you and your child also understand the school's emergency 
procedures for disasters. This will help you coordinate where, when, and how to 
reunite with your child after an earthquake.</p>.<p>During your earthquake drill:</p>.<p><b><a name="earthquake_evacuation_plans" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If an earthquake occurs, you may 
need to evacuate a damaged area afterward. By planning and practicing for 
evacuation, you will be better prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently 
to signs of danger or to directions by civil authorities.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_to_establish__priorities_and_personal_documentation_paperwork" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Take time before an earthquake strikes to write an emergency priority list, 
including:</p>.<p>Make a list of important information and put it in a secure location. Include 
on your list:</p>.<p>Gather and Store Important Documents in a Fire-Proof Safe</p>.<p><b><a name="indoor_safety" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are actions you can take, even while an earthquake is happening, that 
will reduce your chances of being hurt. Lights may be out, and hallways, stairs, 
and room exits may be blocked by fallen furniture, ceiling tiles, and other 
debris. Planning for these situations will help you to take action quickly.</p>.<p><b>High-Rise Buildings</b> </p>.<p>Get under a desk and stay away from windows and outside walls. Stay in the 
building. The electricity may go out, and the sprinkler systems may come on. <b>DO 
NOT use the elevators. </b> </p>.<p>If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others 
will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that 
may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face 
from falling debris and glass.</p>.<p><b>Crowded Indoor Public Places</b> </p>.<p>If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others

from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls. Once in 
the open, stay there until the shaking stops. </p>.<p><b><a name="automobiles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you are in a moving automobile, stop as quickly and safely as possible and 
move over to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and 
under- or overpasses. Stay in the vehicle, set the parking brake, and turn on 
the radio for emergency broadcast information. A car may jiggle violently on its 
springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. If you are in a 
life-threatening situation, you may be able to reach someone with either a 
cellular or an emergency roadside assistance phone. </p>.<p>When you drive on, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as 
breaks in the pavement, downed utility poles and wires, a fallen overpasses and
