<p><b><a name="introduction_to_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids (short for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroids</a>) are synthetic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone that your body produces naturally. Steroids work by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system. They are used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases and conditions.</p>.<p>Corticosteroids are different from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anabolic_steroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">anabolic steroids</a>, which some athletes use to build bigger muscles. Examples of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroid</a> medications include triamcinolone, cortisone, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">prednisone</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylprednisolone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">methylprednisolone</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_steroids_given" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids can be given topically (cream or ointment), by mouth (orally), or by injection. When injected, they can be given into a vein or muscle, directly into a joint or bursa (lubricating sac between certain tendons and the bones beneath them) or around tendons and other soft tissue areas.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_steroids_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids decrease inflammation and reduce the activity of the immune system. Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and chemicals protect the body against infection and foreign organisms such as bacteria and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a>.</p>.<p>In certain diseases, however, the body's defense system (immune system) doesn't function properly and is overactive. This may cause inflammation to work against the body's own tissues and cause tissue damage. Inflammation is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>.</p>.<p>Steroids reduce the production of inflammatory chemicals in order to minimize tissue damage. Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system by affecting the function of white blood cells. <span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_are_treated_with_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids are used to treat a variety of conditions in which the body's defense system malfunctions and causes tissue damage. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as systemic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vasculitis</a> (inflammation of blood vessels) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polymyositis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myositis</a> (inflammation of muscle). They may also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lupus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sjogrens_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gout</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_benefits_of_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When inflammation threatens to damage critical body organs, steroids can be organ saving and, in many instances, life-saving. For example, they may help prevent the progression of kidney inflammation, which can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a> in people who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lupus_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lupus</a> or vasculitis. For these people, steroid therapy may eliminate the need for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemodialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">kidney dialysis</a> or transplant.</p>.<p>Low doses of steroids may provide significant relief from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> and stiffness for people with conditions including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. Temporary use of higher doses of steroids may help a person recover from a severe flare-up of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_are_steroids_injected" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Injecting steroids into one or two areas of inflammation allows doctors to deliver a high dose of the drug directly to the problem area. When doctors give steroids by mouth or IV, they cannot be sure an adequate amount will eventually reach the problem area. In addition, the risk of side effects is much higher with oral or IV steroids. <span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_are_treated_with_steroid_injections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids often are injected directly into joints to treat conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">gout</a>, or other inflammatory diseases. They also can be injected into an inflamed bursa or around tendons near most joints in the body.</p>.<p>Some people report relief from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a> when steroids are injected directly into swollen or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">painful joints</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_expected_benefits_of_steroid_injections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroid injections into a specific area are generally well tolerated and are less likely than other forms of steroid drugs to produce serious side effects. Also, the injections may help avoid the need for oral steroids or increased doses of oral steroids, which could have greater side effects.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_role_do_steroid_injections_play_in_an_overall_treatment_program" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroid injections can be added to a treatment program that may already include anti-inflammatory pain medications (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a>), physical therapy, occupational therapy, or supportive devices such as canes and braces. Whether one or more of these treatment methods are used depends on the nature of the problem.</p>.<p>For example, in an otherwise healthy person, tendinitis may be adequately treated with only a steroid injection into the inflamed area. However, in a person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_ra_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, injections are generally a small part of a multifaceted treatment approach.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_steroid_injections_not_be_used" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids should not be injected when there is infection in the area to be targeted or even elsewhere in the body because they could inhibit the natural infection-fighting immune response. Also, if a joint is already severely destroyed, injections are not likely to provide any benefit.</p>.<p>If someone has a potential bleeding problem or is taking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anticoagulants_drug_class_of_blood_thinners/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">anticoagulants</a> (often referred to as blood thinners), steroid injections may cause bleeding at the site. For these people, injections are given with caution.</p>.<p>Frequent steroid injections, more often than every three or four months, are not recommended because of an increased risk of weakening tissues in the treated area. <span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_side_effects_of_steroid_injections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroid injections are one of the most effective ways to decrease pain and improve function, yet they generally do not cure the illness.</p>.<p>In rare instances, the following side effects might occur:</p>.<p>Not everyone will develop side effects and side effects vary from person to person. If steroid injections are infrequent (less than every three to four months), it is possible that none of the listed side effects will occur.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_possible_side_effects_of_oral_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Side effects are more common with a higher dose and longer treatment. Side effects are much more common with oral drugs. Some side effects are more serious than others.

If steroid use is brief (from a few days to a few weeks), it is possible that none of the listed side effects will occur. The side effects listed generally do not occur when occasional steroid injections are given for arthritis, tendinitis, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bursitis</a>.</p>.<p>However, if steroid use involves high doses and is prolonged (for a few months to several years), an increase in the number of side effects may occur.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_steroid_side_effects_be_minimized" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To minimize the side effects of steroids, doctors follow these guidelines:</p>.<p><b><a name="who_should_not_take_steroids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Steroids, as with other drugs, are not recommended for everyone.

Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>
