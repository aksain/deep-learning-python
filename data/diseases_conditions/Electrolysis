Hair growth is the result of heredity and hormonal levels. Also, some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>,
temporary methods of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_removal/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hair removal</a>, and some illnesses can stimulate hair
growth. Usually, hair growth is desirable. But when the hair is the wrong part
of your <nobr>body -- a</nobr> woman's upper lip or chin or bikini line, for <nobr>example -- you</nobr> may be
considering electrolysis.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatments" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since many factors influence hair growth, you will need to return for
several electrolysis visits. The total number of sessions needed to remove hair permanently
from a particular area will vary from person to person. Most clients return
once a week or every other week, as necessary. But the unwanted hair will be
gone forever once the series of treatments have been completed. Each treatment
lasts between 15 minutes and one hour.</p>.<p><b><a name="myths" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Electrolysis is painful. The truth is, electrolysis usually does not cause
much discomfort. Modern electrolysis methods have reduced the discomfort to a
mere tingling. A topical anesthetic may be used in some cases.</p>.<p>
The electric tweezer method is permanent. The truth is, the Food and Drug
Administration and the American Medical Association recognize only electrolysis
as a permanent method of removing hair. In fact, some states prohibit those who
use the electric <nobr>tweezer -- which</nobr> can also be purchased for consumer <nobr>use -- from</nobr>
claiming it provides permanent hair removal.</p>.<p>
Temporary methods of hair removal can be better. Chemical
depilatories (liquids or creams) are often used to remove body hair. These
products contain irritating chemicals, and can be time-consuming and messy.
Likewise, bleaches contain harsh chemicals and do little to disguise dark hair.
They may also discolor the skin. Waxing is another temporary method of hair
removal and is usually done in salons. A hot wax is applied to the skin and
removed once it has dried over the hair. The hair is stripped off when the wax
is removed. Waxing can be painful and costly. Home waxing kits are available,
but they can be difficult to use and messy. There are electrical electrolysis
devices available for home use that try to copy the devices used by
professionals. These devices are often unsafe for use by anyone who is not
trained in electrolysis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="choose" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Electrologists are people who have undergone training to professionally
administer the electrolysis procedure. If you are considering undergoing
electrolysis, it is very important that you do your research before committing
to an appointment. The wrong decision can mean extra sessions and cost and
unnecessary discomfort. By following the guidelines listed below, you can take
comfort in knowing that you will be making an educated and informed decision
when choosing an electrologist.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
