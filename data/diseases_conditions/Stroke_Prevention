<p><b><a name="introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you're like most Americans, you plan for your future. When you take a job, 
you examine its benefit plan. When you buy a home, you consider its location and 
condition so that your investment is safe. Today, more and more Americans are 
protecting their most important asset--their health. Are you?</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Stroke</a> ranks as the third leading killer in the United 
States. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> can be devastating to individuals and their families, robbing 
them of their independence. It is the most common cause of adult disability. 
Each year more than 700,000 Americans have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, with about 160,000 dying 
from stroke-related causes. Officials at the National Institute of Neurological 
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) are committed to reducing that burden through 
biomedical research.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A stroke, or "brain attack," occurs when blood circulation 
to the brain fails. Brain cells can die from decreased blood flow and the 
resulting lack of oxygen. There are two broad categories of stroke: </p>.<p><b>Blockage of Blood Flow</b></p>.<p>While not usually 
fatal, a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain or neck, called an ischemic stroke, is the most 
frequent cause of stroke and is responsible for about 80 percent of strokes. 
These blockages stem from three conditions: </p>.<p><b>Bleeding</b></p>.<p>Bleeding into 
the brain or the spaces surrounding the brain causes the second type of stroke, 
called hemorrhagic stroke.</p>.<p>Two key steps you can take will lower your risk of death or disability from 
stroke: know stroke's warning signs and control stroke's risk factors. 
Scientific research conducted by the NINDS has identified warning signs and a 
large number of risk factors.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_warning_signs_of_a_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Warning signs are clues your body sends that your brain is not receiving 
enough oxygen. <b>If you observe one or more of these signs of a stroke or "brain 
attack," don't wait, call a doctor or 911 right away!</b></p>.<p>Other danger signs that may occur include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/double_vision/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">double vision</a>, 
drowsiness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>. Sometimes the warning signs may last only a few moments and 
then disappear. These brief episodes, known as 
transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are sometimes called "mini-strokes." Although brief, they identify an 
underlying serious condition that isn't going away without medical help. 
Unfortunately, since they clear up, many people ignore them. Don't. Heeding them 
can save your life.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_a_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A risk factor is a condition or behavior that occurs more frequently in those 
who have, or are at greater risk of getting, a disease than in those who don't. 
Having a risk factor for stroke doesn't mean you'll have a stroke. On the other 
hand, not having a risk factor doesn't mean you'll avoid a stroke. But your risk 
of stroke grows as the number and severity of risk factors increases.</p>.<p>Stroke occurs in all age groups, in both sexes, and in all races in every 
country. It can even occur before birth, when the fetus is still in the womb. In 
African-Americans, stroke is more common and more deadly--even in young and 
middle-aged adults--than for any ethnic or other racial group in the United 
States. Scientists have found more and more severe risk factors in some minority 
groups and continue to look for patterns of stroke in these groups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatable_risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the most important treatable risk factors for stroke are:</p>.<p><b><a name="do_you_know_your_stroke_risk" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the most important risk factors for stroke can be determined during a 
physical exam at your doctor's office. If you are over 55 years old, the 
worksheet below can help you estimate your risk of stroke and show the benefit 
of risk-factor control.</p>.<p>The worksheet was developed from NINDS-supported work in the well-known 
Framingham Study. Working with your doctor, you can develop a strategy to lower 
your risk to average or even below average for your age.</p>.<p><b>Key:</b> </p>.<p>

Risk Profile: The Framingham Study." Stroke, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 40-43, January 
1994. </p>.<p>Many risk factors for stroke can be managed, some very 
successfully. Although risk is never zero at any age, by starting early and 
controlling your risk factors you can lower your risk of death or disability 
from stroke. With good control, the risk of stroke in most age groups can be 
kept below that for accidental injury or death. </p>.<p>Americans have shown that stroke is preventable and treatable. In recent 
years, a better understanding of the causes of stroke has helped Americans make 
lifestyle changes that have cut the stroke <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/grief_bereavement_mourning_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">death rate</a> nearly in half. </p>.<p>Scientists at the NINDS predict that, with continued attention to reducing 
the risks of stroke and by using currently available therapies and developing 
new ones, Americans should be able to prevent 80 percent of all strokes. </p>.<p class="credits">SOURCE: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; "Brain
