Your vision gradually regresses, mostly during the first three months following LTK laser eye surgery. To compensate, the doctor will intentionally overcorrect, so you end up with your desired vision.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_advantages_of_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The advantages of LTK laser eye surgery include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_disadvantages_of_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The disadvantages of LTK laser eye surgery include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_potential_side_effects_of_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Other than nearsightedness, you may also feel as if you have a foreign object in your eye. But this sensation should go away after the first day with the help of eye drops given to you by your doctor. You may also experience sensitivity to light the first day or so following LTK laser eye surgery, but <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or other discomfort is rarely associated with this procedure.</p>.<p><b><a name="whos_a_candidate_for_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Due to its non-permanent effects, LTK laser eye surgery is only performed in people over the age of 40 who are mildly farsighted. Other than age, the qualifications for this surgery are the same as the  qualifications for any refractive surgery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_should_i_prepare_for_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before your LTK laser eye surgery you will meet with a coordinator who will discuss what you should expect during and after the surgery. During this session your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be tested. Likely tests include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through your evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any further questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the procedure.</p>.<p>If you wear rigid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gas</a> permeable <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contact lenses</a>, you should not wear them for three weeks before your surgery. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to surgery. Be sure to bring your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eyeglasses_sunglasses_and_magnifiers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eyeglasses</a> to the surgeon so your prescription can be reviewed.</p>.<p>On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beauty_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">makeup</a> or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you do not feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_the_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>LTK laser eye surgery is done under a local anesthesia. During LTK laser eye surgery, a laser beam uses heat to shrink and reshape the cornea. Vision is corrected in a matter of seconds, without any cutting or removal of tissue.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_expect_after_ltk_laser_eye_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After LTK laser eye surgery, most doctors will schedule follow-up appointments for the next day as well as for one week, one month, and 3-6 months after LTK laser eye surgery. To prevent infection or any irritation that may occur, you will be given antibiotic drops as well as anti-inflammatory drops to take for one week after LTK laser eye surgery.</p>.<p>As previously mentioned, for the first week after LTK laser eye surgery it is common to experience nearsightedness, however as the regression slows your distance vision will improve considerably. From the end of the first week to 3 months following LTK laser eye surgery, you should expect some fluctuations of vision.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p class="credits">Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.
