<p>Impetigo (pronounced im-puh-TIE-go) is a contagious, superficial infection of the skin caused by <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Staphylococcus</a></i> (staph) and <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/streptococcal_infections/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Streptococcus</a></i> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/strep_streptococcal_throat_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">strep</a>) bacteria. Impetigo is more common in children (especially 2- to 5-year-olds) than in adults. Impetigo is most likely to occur in warm and humid environments and is most commonly spread by close contact (such as between family members). Many years ago the formal name for this disease was "impetigo contageosum."</p>.<p>A rarely used <em>ecthyma</em> is the term for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a> similar to impetigo, but the infection penetrates the skin more deeply. (Its therapy is similar to impetigo.)</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are two forms of impetigo:</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Impetigo is contagious, primarily from direct contact with someone who has it, but sometimes from towels, toys, clothing, or household items. After starting in one location, impetigo often spreads to other parts of the body. This is particularly common with impetigo in children. There may be mini epidemics in day care centers. Bacteria that cause impetigo may enter through a break in the skin, such as that which comes from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scrapes</a>. A common child impetigo experience is the development of impetigo lesions at the nasal openings inflamed by the prominent nasal drainage associated with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold</a>. In this situation, skin integrity is often disrupted by the continuous covering of purulent nasal discharge. Adults often develop impetigo from close contact with infected children. Heat, humidity, and the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a> predispose a person to developing impetigo. Recurrent impetigo infections may be associated with staph or strep bacteria residing in the nose and spreading from to other parts of the skin.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Diagnosing an impetigo infection is generally straightforward and based on the clinical appearance. Occasionally, other conditions may look something like impetigo. Skin infections such as tinea ("<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ringworm</a>") or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scabies/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scabies</a> (mites) may be confused with impetigo. It is important to note that not every sore or blister means an impetigo infection. At times, other infected and noninfected skin diseases produce blister-like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin inflammation</a>. Such conditions include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">herpes</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/herpes_simplex_infections_non-genital/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold sores</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chickenpox</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/poison_ivy_oak_and_sumac/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">poison ivy</a>, skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_atopic_dermatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eczema</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bug_bites_and_stings/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">insect bites</a>. Secondary skin infections may sometimes occur. Medical evaluation and occasionally culture tests are used to decide whether topical antibacterial creams will suffice or whether oral antibiotics will be necessary.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>An impetigo infection is not serious and is very treatable. Mild impetigo can be handled by gentle cleansing of the sores, removing crusts from the infected person, and applying the prescription-strength antibiotic ointment <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mupirocin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">mupirocin</a> (Bactroban). Nonprescription topical antibiotic ointments (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neomycinbacitracinpolymyxin-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Neosporin</a>) generally are not effective. More severe or widespread impetigo, especially of bullous impetigo, may require oral antibiotic medication. In recent years, more staph germs have developed resistance to standard antibiotics. Bacterial culture tests can help a doctor to guide the use of proper oral therapy if needed. Antibiotics which can be helpful include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/penicillins-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">penicillin</a> derivatives (such as <span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_32"></span><span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_32">amoxicillin</span>-clavulanic acid [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amoxicillin_and_clavulanic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Augmentin</a>]) and cephalosporins such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cephalexin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">cephalexin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cephalexin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Keflex</a>). If clinical suspicion supported by culture results show other bacteria, such as drug-resistant staph (methicillin-resistant <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Staphylococcus aureus</a></i> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mrsa_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">MRSA</a>), other antibiotics such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clindamycin-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">clindamycin</a> or <span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_39"><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trimethoprim/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">trimethoprim</a>-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfamethoxazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sulfamethoxazole</a></span><span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_40"> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfamethoxazole_and_trimethoprim/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Bactrim</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfamethoxazole_and_trimethoprim/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Septra</a>) may be necessary. Treatment is guided by laboratory results (culture and sensitivity tests).<span id="cntid"></span></span></p>.<p>An excellent prognosis of complete cure and recovery of the infected area is anticipated when impetigo is treated. In fact, many specialists in infectious diseases would propose that a poor response to appropriate antibiotic therapy should raise concerns regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis. A potentially serious but rare complication of impetigo caused by strep bacteria is glomerulonephritis, a condition producing kidney inflammation. Many specialists are not convinced that treating impetigo will prevent glomerulonephritis from occurring.</p>.<p>Because the crusts and blisters of impetigo are superficial, impetigo generally does not leave <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scars</a>. Affected skin looks red for a while after the crusts go away, but this redness fades in a matter of days to weeks. Once the skin has healed, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunscreen</a> application is indicated.</p>.<p></p>.<p>Routine hand washing with soap and warm water is an important and effective mechanism to prevent the spread of impetigo. Impetigo is generally felt to be contagious during the first 24 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy. A bandage covering the infected area should be applied during this time. The incubation period (the time between exposure to the bacteria and the first development of symptoms) depends on the infective bacteria. Strep-caused impetigo has a shorter incubation period (one to three days) than staph-caused impetigo (four to 10 days).</p>.<p>A primary care doctor -- pediatrician, family practice doctor, or internist -- can routinely manage evaluation and treatment of impetigo. If there are unusual health issues or no response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, a specialist in infectious diseases could be consulted.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
