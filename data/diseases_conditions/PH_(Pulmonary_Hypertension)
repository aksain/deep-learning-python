<p><b><a name="pulmonary_hypertension_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_pulmonary_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pulmonary hypertension occurs when the pressure in the pulmonary arteries increases abnormally. To help explain this condition further, here is how the pulmonary arteries work.</p>.<p>The human body has two major sets of blood vessels that distribute blood from the heart to the body. One set pumps blood from the right heart to the lungs, and the other from the left heart to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). When a doctor or a nurse measures the blood pressure on a person's arm, he/she is measuring the pressures in the systemic circulation. When these pressures are abnormally high, the person is diagnosed as having high blood pressure (systemic hypertension).</p>.<p>The portion of the circulation that distributes the blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and back to the left side of the heart is referred to as the pulmonary (lung) circulation.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">right ventricle</a> pumps blood returning from the body into the pulmonary arteries to the lungs to receive oxygen. The pressures in the lung arteries (pulmonary arteries) are normally significantly lower than the pressures in the systemic circulation. When pressure in the pulmonary circulation becomes abnormally elevated, it is referred to as pulmonary hypertension. This most commonly occurs when the pulmonary venous pressure is elevated, so called pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH). This pressure is transmitted back to the right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries. The result is elevated pulmonary pressure throughout the pulmonary circulation. Some of this is a direct pressure transmission from the venous system backward and some can result from a reactive constriction of the pulmonary arteries.</p>.<p>Less commonly, pulmonary hypertension results from constriction, or stiffening, of the pulmonary arteries that supply blood to the lungs, so called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).</p>.<p>Whether it is pulmonary venous or pulmonary arterial hypertension, it becomes more difficult for the heart to pump blood forward through the lungs. This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> on the heart leads to enlargement of the right heart and eventually fluid can build up in the liver and other tissues, such as the in the legs.</p>.<p>When the heart pumps blood it is referred to as systole, and when the heart fills with blood it is referred to as diastole. Normal pulmonary artery pressures range from an upper pressure (systolic) of 15-30 mmHg and a lower pressure (diastolic) of 4-12 mmHg. These values can be obtained approximately by and ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram), and more accurately using a catheter to measure the pressures in the pulmonary circulation (right heart catheterization).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_pulmonary_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many people with pulmonary hypertension may have no symptoms at all, especially if the disease is mild or in the early stages.</p>.<p>Pulmonary hypertension symptoms may include:</p>.<p>Signs of pulmonary hypertension may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="which_diseases_are_common_in_people_with_the_condition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no clear statistical data on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension. Since pulmonary hypertension is seen in multiple different conditions, it is perhaps better to look at the prevalence in each condition. It is fairly common in patients with heart failure, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">COPD</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep apnea</a>. It occurs in 7% to 12% of patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/connective_tissue_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">collagen vascular disease</a>, and in less than 5% of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV</a> patients.</p>.<p><b><a name="classification_of_primary_and_secondary_pulmonary_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The conventional classification, primary (idiopathic) and secondary pulmonary hypertension, which also is called pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been reclassified and is now is based on the main underlying cause, characteristics, and treatments of pulmonary hypertension. These terms were updated in 2013.This system classifies the condition based on five classes.</p>.<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension including idiopathic previously referred to as primary pulmonary arterial hypertension), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> pulmonary arterial hypertension, drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension</p>.<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the following:</p>.<p>Pulmonary hypertension due to left <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">heart disease</a>; an elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure because of increased pulmonary venous pressure, backing up into the lungs. This includes heart failure, valvular heart disease, and some congenital heart disease.</p>.<p>Pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (low oxygen levels). This includes:</p>.<p>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (chronic blood clots to the lungs that don't dissolve).</p>.<p>Pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_pulmonary_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many causes of pulmonary hypertension. Often more than one mechanism is involved in a specific disease process. This can also change as the disease progresses.</p>.<p>Primary pulmonary hypertension has no identifiable underlying cause. This term is mainly a historical name and no longer used. The current term used to describe this condition is idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is more common in young people and more common in females than males.</p>.<p>Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension unusually is an aggressive and often fatal form of pulmonary hypertension. Whereas it is known that the arterial obstruction is caused by a building up of the smooth muscle cells that line the arteries, the underlying cause of the disease has long been a mystery.</p>.<p>A genetic cause of the familial form of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, now referred to as Heritable PAH, has been discovered. It is caused by mutations in a gene called BMPR2. BMPR2 encodes a receptor (a transforming growth factor beta type II receptor) that sits on the surface of cells and binds molecules of the TGF-beta superfamily. Binding triggers conformational changes that are shunted down into the cell's interior where a series of biochemical reactions occur, ultimately affecting the cell's behavior. The mutations block this process. This discovery may provide a means of genetic diagnosis and a potential target for the therapy of people with familial (and possibly also sporadic) primary pulmonary hypertension.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_pulmonary_hypertension_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first step in diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is to clinically suspect it. This may be done as part of an evaluation of another disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension (such as scleroderma or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>), or based on patients and signs and symptoms as described above.</p>.<p>Pulmonary hypertension is defined as the mean pulmonary artery blood pressure greater than 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) measured by right heart catheterization. The pressures can be much higher than 25 mmHg in some people. Therefore, the pulmonary hypertension can be labeled as mild, moderate, or severe based on the pressures. Mean arterial pressure calculated by multiplying the diagnostic pressure two times, and adding the systolic pressure to that number, and then divide by three (systolic is the upper number and diastolic is the lower number in measuring blood pressure). Normally, the pulmonary blood pressure is much lower pressure system than the systemic blood pressure (which is usually measured with a blood pressure cuff).</p>.<p>Other tests available for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrocardiogram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ECG</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EKG</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a>, and echocardiogram. An ECG may show some abnormalities that may be suggestive of right heart failure. Chest x-ray may also show enlargement of the chambers of the right heart. And echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) shows ultrasound images of the heart and can detect evidence of right heart failure and with the use of Doppler (as described previously) can estimate pressures in the pulmonary artery. These tests, in the right clinical setting, are very useful in diagnosing and managing pulmonary hypertension.</p>.<p>Other tests may be useful in evaluating the conditions leading to secondary pulmonary hypertension. For example, a ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan) can suggest blood clots in the pulmonary arteries or sometimes a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> of the chest can be used. The chest CT scan can detect pulmonary arterial clots, but also can show abnormalities of the lung tissue and surrounding structures that can contribute to pulmonary hypertension.</p>.<p>Pulmonary function testing can be useful in diagnosing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (COPD), and other lung diseases, and monitor disease progression. This test can be used to detect many aspects of lung function including airflow and evidence of obstruction, lung volumes, and the capacity for the lung to extract oxygen from the air.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Sleep</a> studies can confirm the diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> apnea and its severity and management options such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">CPAP</a> therapy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_pulmonary_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for pulmonary hypertension depends on the underlying cause.</p>.<p><b><a name="medications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are three major classes of drugs used to treat idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with collagen vascular diseases: 1) prostaglandins; 2) phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor; and 3) endothelium-receptor antagonists.</p>.<p>Currently, research is investigating the best ways to combine these medications for the optimal clinical outcomes. It should be noted that these medications are extremely expensive, costing of dollars per year. The companies that manufacture these medications often have programs to assist in funding. These more advanced therapies have also been used for other forms of pulmonary hypertension, however, no clinical studies have yet confirmed benefits in these situations.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_cure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Despite advances in various treatments, there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_life_expectancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generally, the prognosis of pulmonary varies depending on the underlying condition that is causing it. For idiopathic or familial pulmonary hypertension, the overall prognosis depends on the severity and whether treatment was instituted. The statistics show a survival of about 3 years in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension without any therapy. Some of the other factors may indicate even poorer prognosis which include severe symptoms, age of onset greater than 45 years, evidence of right sided heart failure, and failure to respond to treatment. For patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension who get started on treatment and respond to it, the prognosis is better. Studies are underway to determine optimal treatment regimens.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_types_of_doctors_treat_pulmonary_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generally, pulmonary physicians (pulmonologists) and cardiologists treat pulmonary hypertension. Depending on the cause, other physicians also may be involved such as sleep medicine doctors, rheumatologists, and perhaps even infectious disease specialists. Today, more health-care professionals in the community are becoming adept at managing pulmonary hypertension. However, it is reasonable to get a second opinion regarding management at a tertiary, university setting because the field of management of pulmonary artery hypertension is evolving rapidly.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
