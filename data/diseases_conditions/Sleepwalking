<p><b><a name="sleepwalking_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleepwalking is characterized by a complex action behavior (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">walking</a>) during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>. Occasionally, the person may talk, but it does not make sense. The person's eyes are commonly open, but have a characteristic glassy "look right through you" character.</p>.<p>Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during early childhood and less commonly during adolescence.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_you_do_when_someone_is_sleepwalking_should_you_wake_them_up" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>One common misconception is that a person sleepwalking should not be awakened. It is not dangerous to awaken a sleepwalker, although it is common for the person to be confused or disoriented for a short time when awake. Another misconception is that a person cannot be injured while sleepwalking. Injuries caused by sleepwalking, for example, tripping and loss of balance, are common.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_do_people_walk_in_their_sleep" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleepwalking has been described in medical literature dating before Hippocrates (460 BC-370 BC). In Shakespeare's tragic play, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth's famous sleepwalking scene ("out, damned spot") is ascribed to her guilt and resulting insanity as a consequence of her involvement in the murder of her father-in-law.</p>.<p>Parasomnias are a group of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> behaviors common in in children, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a>, and occasionally adults. To understand parasomnias, it is helpful to understand the physiology of sleep.</p>.<p>Sleep occurs in two broad categories defined by characteristic changes during an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eeg_-_electroencephalogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EEG</a> (electro encephalogram, “brain wave test”). The two categories are REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep cycles. Non-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">REM sleep</a> has four “levels” characterized by unique patterns of the EEG.</p>.<p>An entire sleep cycle from Stage I (non-REM) thru REM sleep lasts between 90 and-120 minutes and repeats 4 to 5 times during the sleep experience. Each “level” of non-REM and REM sleep last between 5 to 15 minutes. A large Canadian study reviewed sleep patterns of children aged 2.5 to 6 years and discovered approximately 88% of them experienced parasomnias, and 15% were sleepwalkers. Other signs and symptoms associated with sleepwalking were: (1) sleep terrors (40%), (2) sleep <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encopresis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enuresis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bedwetting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bedwetting</a>, 25%), (3) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teeth_grinding_bruxism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruxism</a> (grinding of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">teeth</a>, 46%), and rhythmic movements (such as head banging, 9%).</p>.<p>Sleepwalking characteristically occurs during the first or second sleep cycles, specifically, during stages III and IV, otherwise known as deep sleep. Due the short time frame involved, sleepwalking tends not to occur during naps.</p>.<p>Sleepwalking activity may include simply sitting up and appearing awake while remaining asleep, getting up and walking around, or complex activities such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, dressing and undressing, and similar activities. Some people even drive a car while actually asleep. The episode can be very brief (a few seconds or minutes) or can last for 30 minutes or longer.</p>.<p>Upon waking, the sleepwalker has no memory of his or her behaviors.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleepwalking seems to be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> (genetic), environmental, physiologic, and medical factors.</p>.<p>One study documented that sleepwalking is ten times more likely to occur if a first-degree relative has a history of sleepwalking.</p>.<p>Sleep deprivation, chaotic sleep schedules, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>, magnesium deficiency, and alcohol intoxication can trigger sleepwalking. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Drugs</a>, for example, sedative/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypnotics_drug_class_side_effects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">hypnotics</a> (drugs that promote sleep), neuroleptics (drugs used to treat psychosis), minor tranquilizers (drugs that produce a calming effect), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a> (drugs that increase activity), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a> (drugs used to treat symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a>) associated with an increased likelihood of sleepwalking.</p>.<p>Physiologic factors that may contribute to sleepwalking include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_of_sleepwalking_how_can_you_tell_if_they_are_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Following are examples of symptoms of sleepwalking.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Usually, no exams and tests are necessary.

To help prevent sleepwalking, underlying medical condition should be treated.</p>.<p>Medications for the treatment of sleepwalking disorder may be necessary in the following situations:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benzodiazepines_sleep-inducing-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Benzodiazepines</a>, such as estazolam (ProSom), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tricyclic_antidepressants-oral_injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tricyclic antidepressants</a>, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trazodone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">trazodone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trazodone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Desyrel</a>), have been shown to be useful. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonazepam/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Clonazepam</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonazepam/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Klonopin</a>) in low doses before bedtime and continued for three to 6 weeks is usually effective.</p>.<p>Medication can often be discontinued after three to 5 weeks without recurrence of symptoms. Occasionally, the frequency of episodes increases briefly after discontinuing the medication.</p>.<p>Relaxation techniques, mental imagery, and anticipatory awakenings are preferred for long-term treatment of persons with sleepwalking disorder.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_sleep_conditions_have_similar_symptoms_of_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleepwalking, night terrors, and confusional arousals are all related, common non-REM <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep disorders</a> that tend to overlap in some of their symptoms. Approximately 15%-20% of young children through mid-adolescence will experience some or all of these behaviors. Moreover, seizures occurring during sleep (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria_pnh/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nocturnal</a> seizures) can cause movement disorder during sleeping.</p>.<p><b>Night terrors:</b> Like sleepwalking night terrors tend to occur during the first half of a night's sleep - often within 30 to 90 minutes from falling asleep. Also like sleepwalking, they occur during stage III of non-REM sleep. However, unlike sleepwalking, an individual with night terrors will portray a sudden and often agitated arousal that may appear to parents as violent and terrified behaviors. During such an episode, the child characteristically will not be comforted by an embrace from a parent or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caregiving/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">caregiver</a>.</p>.<p>Night terrors often start during the toddler years with peak incidence between five and seven years of age. During these times evidence of a surge in autonomic nervous system activity is evident. Accelerated heart and respiratory rates, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dilated_pupils_mydriasis/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dilated pupils</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a> are characteristic.</p>.<p>Triggers for night terrors may include sleep deprivation, stress, and medications (stimulants, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypnotics_drug_class_side_effects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sedatives</a>, antihistamines, etc). Unlike sleepwalking, episodes of night terrors may recur for several weeks in a row, abate completely, and later return.</p>.<p><b>Confusional arousals:</b> Similar to night terrors, confusional arousals are characterized by a sudden and violent arousal from sleep with behaviors described as agitated and semi-purposeful in pattern. Speech is generally coherent (unlike sleepwalking). A distinguishing point between night terrors and confusional arousals is the lack of autonomic nervous system (accelerated heart/respiratory rates, dilated pupils, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sweating_perspiration_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sweating</a>) phenomena in the latter. Confusional arousals tend to occur during the first half of a night's sleep (during stage II non-REM sleep). They are characteristically short-lived, lasting 5 to 15 minutes but can last up to 30 minutes in duration. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Amnesia</a> for the event is characteristic.</p>.<p><b>Nocturnal seizures:</b> Several important differential points help delineate the above three sleep behaviors from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizure</a> activity. Seizures by their nature are very brief, often lasting only a few minutes. In addition, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">seizure</a> events are likely to be confused with the above; and are characterized by a series of repeated, stereotypical, and frequent behaviors occurring in clusters. Moreover, seizures more commonly occur in the second half of the night's sleep. Patients often will have postictal (symptoms after the seizure) complications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, extreme grogginess, hard to arouse, as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence_in_women_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">incontinence of urine</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a>. To assist in establishing a correct diagnosis a neurologist may perform a video-EEG study to help clarify the issue. Home videos taken on a smart phone are often very helpful in establishing the diagnosis.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A common complication is injury sustained during sleepwalking activities.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_you_prevent_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_sleepwalking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sleepwalking may or may not reduce with age, as described above.
