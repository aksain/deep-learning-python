<p><b><a name="sjogren#39s_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_sjogren#39s_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes. Autoimmune diseases feature the abnormal production of extra antibodies in the blood that are directed against various tissues of the body. The misdirected immune system in autoimmunity tends to lead to inflammation of tissues. This particular autoimmune illness features inflammation and dysfunction in glands of the body that are responsible for producing tears and saliva. Inflammation of the glands that produce tears (lacrimal glands) leads to decreased water production for tears and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eyes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry eyes</a>. Inflammation of the glands that produce the saliva in the mouth (salivary glands, including the parotid glands) leads to decreased saliva production and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a> and dry lips.</p>.<p>Sjögren's syndrome with gland inflammation (resulting in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eye/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dry eyes</a> and mouth, etc.) that is not associated with another connective tissue disease is referred to as primary Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome that is also associated with a connective tissue disease, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scleroderma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scleroderma</a>, is referred to as secondary Sjögren's syndrome. Dryness of eyes and mouth, in patients with or without Sjögren's syndrome, is sometimes referred to as sicca syndrome.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_sjogren#39s_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the exact cause of Sjögren's syndrome is not known, there is growing scientific support for genetic (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>) factors. The genetic background of Sjögren's syndrome patients is an active area of research. The illness is sometimes found in other family members. It is also found more commonly in families that have members with other autoimmune illnesses, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, autoimmune <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thyroid disease</a>, type I <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, etc. Most patients with Sjögren's syndrome are female.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_developing_sjogren#39s_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The main risk factor for the development of Sjögren's syndrome is being a member of a family that is already characterized as having autoimmune illnesses. This does not mean that it is predictable that a member of a family with known autoimmunity will develop the disease, only that is more likely than if there were no family members with known autoimmunity. Accordingly, it is likely that certain genes that are inherited from ancestors can predispose one to the development of Sjögren's syndrome. It should also be noted that Sjögren's syndrome can also be sporadic and occur in a person from a family with no known autoimmunity.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_sjogren#39s_syndrome_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome can involve the glands, as above, but there are also possible effects of the illness involving other organs of the body (extraglandular manifestations).</p>.<p>When the tear gland (lacrimal gland) is inflamed from Sjögren's, the resulting eye dryness can progressively lead to symptoms such as eye irritation, decreased tear production, a "gritty" sensation, eye infection, and serious <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abrasion</a> of the dome of the eye (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cornea</a>).

Significant dryness of the eyes can be determined in the doctor's office by testing the eye's ability to wet a small testing paper strip placed under the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> (Schirmer's test using Schirmer tear test strips). More sophisticated testing can be done by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).</p>.<p>Sjögren's syndrome salivary glands can become larger and harden or become tender. Salivary-gland inflammation can be detected by radiologic nuclear medicine salivary scans. Also, the diminished ability of the salivary glands to produce saliva can be measured with salivary flow testing. The diagnosis is strongly supported by abnormal findings of a biopsy of salivary-gland tissue.</p>.<p>The glands of the lower lip are occasionally used for a biopsy sample of the salivary-gland tissue in the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. The lower lip salivary-gland biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia with the surgeon making a tiny incision on the inner part of the lower lip to expose and remove a sample of the tiny salivary glands within.</p>.<p>Patients with Sjögren's syndrome typically produce a variety of extra antibodies against body tissues (autoantibodies). These can be detected through blood testing and include antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which are present in nearly all patients. Typical antibodies that are found in most, but not all patients, are SS-A and SS-B antibodies (Sjögren's syndrome A and B antibodies, also known as anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_factor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">rheumatoid factor</a>, thyroid antibodies, and others. Low red blood count (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>) and abnormal blood levels of markers of inflammation (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sedimentation rate</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/c-reactive_protein_test_crp/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">C-reactive protein</a>) are seen.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_sjogren#39s_syndrome_will_changes_to_one#39s_diet_improve_sjogren#39s_syndrome_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of patients with Sjögren's syndrome is directed toward the particular areas of the body that are involved and prevention of complications such as infection. There is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome.</p>.<p>Dryness of the eyes can be helped by artificial tears, using eye-lubricant ointments at night, and minimizing the use of hair dryers. When dryness becomes more significant, the ophthalmologist can plug the tear duct closed so that tears cover the eye longer. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine-oral_capsule/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cyclosporine</a> eyedrops (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Restasis</a>) are approved medicated eyedrops that can reduce the inflammation of the tear glands, thereby improving their function. Signs of eye infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">conjunctivitis</a>), such as pus or excessive redness or pain, should be evaluated by the doctor. Dietary addition of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flaxseed_linum_usitatissimum-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">flaxseed</a> oil may also benefit eye dryness. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Vitamin D</a> supplementation may be beneficial, especially in those who have insufficient <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutritional_health_vitamin_d_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">vitamin D</a> blood levels.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dry mouth</a> can be helped by drinking plenty of fluids, humidifying air, and good dental care to avoid dental decay.
