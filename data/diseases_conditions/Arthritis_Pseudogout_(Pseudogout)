<p><b><a name="pseudogout_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_pseudogout" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pseudogout is a type of inflammation of joints (arthritis) that is caused by deposits of crystals, called calcium pyrophosphate, in and around the joints. Pseudogout literally means "false <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gout</a>." It derives its name from its similarity to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">gout</a>.</p>.<p></p>.<p>Pseudogout has many similarities to true <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">gout</a>, which also can cause arthritis. However, the crystal that incites the inflammation of gout is monosodium urate. The crystals that cause pseudogout and gout each have distinct appearances when joint fluid containing them is viewed under a microscope. This makes it possible to precisely identify the cause of the joint inflammation when joint fluid is available.</p>.<p>Pseudogout has been reported to occasionally coexist with gout. This means that the two types of crystals can sometimes be found in the same joint fluid. Researchers have also noted that the cartilage of patients who had both forms of crystals in their joint fluid was often visibly calcified, as seen on X-ray images.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_of_pseudogout" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pseudogout is primarily caused by the precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals developing within a joint space. Pseudogout has sometimes been referred to as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or CPPD.</p>.<p>Pseudogout is clearly related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> as it is more common in the elderly and is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">degenerative arthritis</a>. Acute attacks of the arthritis of pseudogout can be caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a>. This is particularly common in hospitalized patients and those recovering from operations, especially when associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a>. Pseudogout can also be caused by the hormonal effects on calcium metabolism from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperparathyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hyperparathyroidism</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_pseudogout" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Older age and a history of joint <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> (either due to an accident or surgery) are risk factors for pseudogout.</p>.<p>Additional risk factors for pseudogout include hyperparathyroidism, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amyloidosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">amyloidosis</a>, gout, and degenerative arthritis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_pseudogout_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pseudogout can result in arthritis of a number of joints. The most common joint affected is the knee, but it can also involve the wrists, shoulders, hips, and/or ankles. Pseudogout usually affects only one or a few joints at a time. The "attacks" of joint inflammation, characterized by acute joint swelling, warmth, stiffness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>, may last for days to weeks and can resolve spontaneously. The inflammation leads to loss of range of motion and function of the involved joint.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_a_doctor_diagnose_pseudogout" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pseudogout is suggested when abnormal calcifications are seen in the cartilage of joints on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a>. These calcifications are referred to as chondrocalcinosis and very suggestive of a diagnosis of pseudogout when there is also inflammation of the involved joint.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of pseudogout is ultimately made when fluid from a joint is extracted and is examined under a special microscope called a polarizing microscope. With this microscope, the calcium pyrophosphate crystals are clearly identified by their characteristic shape and color (medically term weakly positively birefringent rhomboid crystals).</p>.<p>The arthritis of pseudogout is common in older adults, particularly in the context of dehydration such as occurs with hospitalization or surgery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatments_for_pseudogout" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of pseudogout is directed toward stopping the inflammation in the joints.
