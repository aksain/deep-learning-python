the whites of the eyes (sclerae) caused by elevated levels of bilirubin in the 
blood (hyperbilirubinemia). The term <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jaundice/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">jaundice</a> is derived from the French word 
jaune, which means yellow. 
Jaundice is not technically a disease, but 
rather it is a visible sign of an underlying condition causing increased levels 
of bilirubin in the blood. </p>.<p><b><a name="jaundice_in_newborns_neonatal_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Neonatal</a> jaundice is the most common condition requiring medical evaluation 
in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">newborn</a>. Though it is often a normal and transient physiologic 
consequence of the newborn's immature <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a>, there are a variety of other 
medical conditions which can cause severe neonatal jaundice. Jaundice in the 
newborn must be carefully monitored, as excessively elevated levels of bilirubin 
that go untreated for too long, can lead to permanent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain damage</a> (a condition 
termed kernicterus). </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_jaundice_in_newborns" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, typically 
from an increased production of bilirubin or a decreased ability to metabolize 
and excrete it. Bilirubin is formed when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a> break down and is 
normally metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces. </p>.<p>Neonatal jaundice can be caused by several different conditions, and it is 
very commonly seen in newborns. The most common cause in newborns is physiologic 
jaundice, which affects most newborns and is usually benign. However, 
there are many other causes of neonatal jaundice that can be more serious, and 
require further medical evaluation and intervention. A newborn that develops jaundice within the first 24 hours of life requires immediate medical attention. The following are some 
of the causes of neonatal jaundice. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="physiologic_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This form of jaundice is usually evident on the second or third day of life. 
It is the most common cause of newborn jaundice and it is usually a transient 
and harmless condition. Physiologic jaundice is caused by the inability of the 
newborn's immature liver to metabolize (conjugate) and thus excrete bilirubin, 
which accumulates due to the breakdown of red blood cells which have a shorter 
life-span (70 to 90 days) than adult red blood cells (120 days). This increase in 
red blood cell breakdown and decreased ability to metabolize bilirubin 
overwhelms the newborns ability to properly process and excrete bilirubin. As 
the newborn's liver matures, however, the jaundice eventually disappears after 
1 to 2 weeks.</p>.<p><b><a name="maternal-fetal_blood_group_incompatibility_rh_abo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This form of jaundice occurs when there is incompatibility between the blood 
types of the mother and the fetus. This leads to increased bilirubin levels from 
the breakdown of the fetus' red blood cells (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemolysis/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemolysis</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="breast_milk_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This form of jaundice occurs in breastfed newborns and often appears at the 
end of the first week of life. Certain chemicals in breast milk are thought to 
be responsible. It is usually a harmless condition that resolves spontaneously. 
Mothers typically do not have to discontinue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breastfeeding</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="breastfeeding_jaundice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This form of jaundice occurs when the 
breastfed newborn does NOT receive 
adequate breast milk intake. This may occur because of delayed or insufficient 
milk production by the mother or because of poor feeding  by the newborn. This 
inadequate intake results in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a> and 
fewer bowel movements for the newborn, which results in decreased bilirubin 
excretion from the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="cephalohematoma_a_collection_of_blood_under_the_scalp" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sometimes during the birthing process, the newborn may sustain a 
bruise or 
injury to the head, resulting in a blood collection/blood 
clot under the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a>. As this blood is naturally broken down, sudden 
elevated levels of bilirubin may overwhelm the processing capability of the 
newborn's immature liver, resulting in jaundice.</p>.<p><b><a name="red_blood_cell_enzyme_defects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Inherited genetic enzyme disorders, such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glucose</a>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
deficiency (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/g6pd_deficiency/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">G6PD deficiency</a>) or pyruvate kinase deficiency, for example, can lead to increased 
hemolysis and subsequent elevation in bilirubin levels. </p>.<p><b><a name="red_blood_cell_membrane_defects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Abnormalities in the membrane and shape of red blood cells (for example, 
spherocytosis) can lead to increased hemolysis.</p>.<p>Other causes of neonatal jaundice include prematurity,

degree of elevation in bilirubin levels as well as the exact cause of the 
jaundice. The  yellow discoloration of the skin will begin on the face and 
forehead and extend toward the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> as the levels of bilirubin increase. This 
characteristic progression of jaundice in infants can sometimes allow your 
health care professional to estimate the bilirubin level based on the location and 
extent of the jaundice, though this assessment can often be inaccurate. </p>.<p>The signs and symptoms associated with neonatal jaundice may include the 
following:</p>.<p>Kernicterus, which is caused by prolonged excessively elevated levels of 
bilirubin affecting the central nervous system, must be recognized and promptly 
treated as it can lead to permanent brain damage. Kernicterus is an irreversible 
and chronic condition which can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cerebral_palsy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cerebral palsy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing loss</a>, and 
intellectual impairment. Kernicterus has likely started to develop if the infant 
begins to exhibit extreme lethargy, changes in muscle tone, and a high-pitched 
cry.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_jaundice_in_newborns" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Approximately 60% of all newborns develop jaundice; however newborns with 
certain risk factors are at higher risk for developing neonatal jaundice. Risks 
factors include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_jaundice_in_newborns_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Neonatal jaundice can be diagnosed by examining the newborn and obtaining a 
blood test to check the total serum bilirubin level. Your health care 
professional 
should closely follow your newborn for the development of jaundice, and many 
hospitals routinely check total bilirubin levels on newborns prior to hospital 
discharge. Though the blood test is the most accurate, in certain instances, a 
transcutaneous bilirubin reading can be obtained by placing a handheld sensor 
against the newborns skin. If this reading is high, a blood test may be ordered 
to confirm the total bilirubin level. Bilirubin levels are usually highest at 
3 of 5 days of life. Additional blood tests may be ordered for those newborns who 
require treatment and monitoring, or for those who may have other underlying 
conditions thought to be causing neonatal jaundice. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_jaundice_in_newborns" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The need to treat jaundice in newborns is determined by interpreting the 
total bilirubin level in relation to the newborns age in hours. If the level is 
deemed to be too high, or if it is rising too quickly, treatment is necessary. 
Sometimes, all that is needed for treatment is close monitoring of the bilirubin 
levels, and no further interventions may be necessary. In certain instances, 
treatment for neonatal jaundice can occur at home, while in other cases, 
admission to a hospital is necessary. </p>.<p>Based on the total bilirubin level, the underlying cause leading to jaundice, 
and the newborns clinical condition, various treatment modalities are available 
to treat jaundice in newborns. These include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_jaundice_in_newborns" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The complications associated with neonatal jaundice occur when bilirubin 
levels reach toxic levels, and the bilirubin gets into the central nervous 
system and damages the brain. The brain toxicity can either be reversible (early 
acute bilirubin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">encephalopathy</a>) or the damage may be permanent and irreversible 
(kernicterus). Permanent damage may lead to cerebral palsy, deafness, and 
intellectual impairment. </p>.<p><b><a name="can_jaundice_in_newborns_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some degree of jaundice in newborns is normal and not entirely preventable. 
However, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> of significant hyperbilirubinemia and its complications 
is possible through proper screening (obtaining bilirubin levels), identifying 
newborns at high-risk, close surveillance and monitoring of those infants with 
hyperbilirubinemia, parent education, and prompt treatment when deemed medically 
indicated. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_jaundice_in_newborns" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generally speaking, the prognosis for newborns with jaundice is excellent if 
they receive the appropriate monitoring and treatment, and the vast majority of 
infants with neonatal jaundice will improve with no adverse effects. However, 
health care professionals need to remain vigilant and parents need be informed and 
educated about the potential dangers of severe hyperbilirubinemia in order to 
prevent the devastating consequences of kernicterus. <span id="cntid"></span></p>
