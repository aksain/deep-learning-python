<p>Swelling of the ankle and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a> is relatively frequent symptom in most people. In itself it does not represent a disease but rather the symptom of an underlying disease.</p>.<p>The symptoms of swollen feet and swollen ankles depend on the underlying causes mentioned above.</p>.<p>Swollen ankles and swollen feet have numerous causes. Medically, the word "swollen" means protuberant or abnormally distended. Thus, if an ankle or foot is swollen, means it is increased in size. In most common situations, when the word swollen is used in reference to feet and ankles, the user implies the distention or size increase is due to an increase of fluid in the tissues (also termed edema). However, the broad definition includes any factors that increase ankle or foot size (for example increased fluids, increased inflammatory cells or both). Because the majority of factors that cause foot swelling also may cause ankle swelling, this article will discuss swelling as a general topic to cover both foot and ankle swelling. Some of the few exceptions where only foot or ankle swelling occur without both being involved will be discussed. Swollen feet and ankles usually are a symptom or sign of some underlying problem, the majority of which are not a major cause for concern. However, in some instances, foot, ankle, and toes swelling may warn a person that an underlying problem needs immediate medical attention.</p>.<p>The causes of swollen feet and ankles are numerous; examples of the most of the major causes include:</p>.<p>Picture of pitting edema</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--><!--END IMAGETAG--></p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>A large number of people are at risk for swollen ankles and feet. Below are listed the causes and those people at risk:</p>.<p>Occasionally, <b>specific medical problems</b> will show additional or relatively unique symptoms, for example:</p>.<p><b>Injury or infection</b> of the ankle is usually unilateral, but can be bilateral. Injury or infection is often, in the early stages, limited to either the foot or the ankle, but may spread to each other. Swelling due to trauma usually is localized to the injured area (for example, ankle sprain or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plantar_fasciitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">plantar fasciitis</a> in the foot); in some instances, the swollen skin area may be damaged by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abrasion</a>, laceration, or bruised. Pain usually accompanies traumatic foot or ankle injury. Some infections of the foot or ankle may show localized swelling due to abscess formation (tight smooth skin, warm, and sometimes oozing pus) while other infections (cellulitis) show generalized swelling and warm skin, often with redness of the skin. Pain often is present where infection is located.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Clinical observation and examination is the way swollen feet and ankles are diagnosed. A health care professional will likely ask questions about the swelling to obtain specific information and gain insight into the underlying cause of the swelling; once the cause is determined, treatments can be designed to help the patient. Simple observation and a patient's verbal description of the swollen area may be enough to presumptively diagnose the cause. For example:</p>.<p>Laboratory tests are usually not used to diagnose feet and ankle swelling; however, they may be needed to be ordered in some patients to help diagnose underlying causes of the swelling. X-rays may be used to determine underlying fractures while CT’s or MRI’s may reveal the extent of tissue damage.</p>.<p>Some mild hand and/or foot swelling can resolve without treatment, while other patients can be treated by their primary care doctors. Depending on the underlying cause of the swelling, such specialists as internal medicine, orthopedics, sports medicine, infectious disease, OB/GYN and cardiologists are some examples of specialists that may be consulted.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The treatment for swollen feet and ankles depends on the underlying cause(s). For many people, simply raising their feet above their heart or simply getting off their feet regularly during the day will reduce or eliminate the swelling. However, for many other people, treatment of the underlying cause of the swelling may include antibiotics for infections, a splint or wrap for a sprain, taking appropriate medications for CHF or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">gout</a>.</p>.<p>Emergent and urgent treatment is infrequent for foot or ankle swelling itself, but does occur for certain underlying causes where feet and ankle swelling or localized swelling is an important symptom and sometimes the major symptom. Examples include:</p>.<p><b>Anytime the swelling is accompanied by other major symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or fever, a health-care professional (emergency department or EMS) should be contacted immediately.</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>One of the best home remedies for swollen ankles, feet, and toes is to elevate the swollen extremity slightly above the level of the heart. This is easily done by having the person lie down face up on a bed or couch, and then place pillows under the heels so the feet and ankles so they are higher than the person's chest.</p>.<p>Sitting on a plane seat or on the office chair (or for hours at a time anywhere!) may cause lower extremity swelling. Periodic leg muscle movement by extension and contraction by simply by occasionally walking will help. Some physicians also recommend wearing support hose. Other suggestions are listed in the prevention section below.</p>.<p>Swollen feet and ankles can lead to discomfort and pain when walking or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">running</a> is attempted. Chronic swelling can lead to skin color changes and skin ulcers. The skin ulcers can occasionally become infected. The skin infections can be further complicated by abscess formation, cellulitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/necrotizing_fasciitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">necrotizing fasciitis</a>, and death. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>In many situations, the swelling in feet and ankles can be reduced or prevented. The following is a list of ways to reduce or prevent ankle and feet swelling:</p>.<p>Because there are so many underlying causes of feet and ankle swelling, there are numerous ways to avoid or reduce the chances for their development. The reader is urged to follow up on this article by reading about ways to prevent underlying causes of swelling.</p>.<p>The majority of people with swollen feet and ankles have a good to excellent outcome because the swelling is usually reversible and has no lasting complications. However, a significant number of patients who have underlying causes that are chronic and refractory to treatment have a wider range of prognosis (good to poor) depending on how well the patient responds to both lifestyle changes and medications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
