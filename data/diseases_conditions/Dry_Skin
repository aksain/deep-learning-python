<p><b><a name="dry_skin_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_dry_skin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dry skin is a very common skin condition characterized by a lack of the appropriate amount of water in the most superficial layer of the skin, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">epidermis</a>. While dry skin tends to affect males and females equally, older individuals are typically much more prone to dry skin. The skin in elderly individuals tends to have diminished amounts of natural skin oils and lubricants. Areas such as the arms, hands, and particularly lower legs tend to be more affected by dry skin. Environmental factors, such as humidity and temperature, have a profound effect on the amount of water retained within the skin. For example, cold, dry air when heated by a furnace will produce dry skin by evaporating moisture on the skin. Frequent hand-washing and sanitizing causes evaporation and dryness. Dry skin may also be a side effect of some medications as well as a byproduct of certain skin diseases.</p>.<p>The epidermis is normally composed of fat (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipid</a>) and protein. The lipid portion of the epidermis along with specific epidermal proteins (for example, filaggrin) help prevent skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a>. When there deficient proteins and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipids</a> the skin moisture evaporates more easily. As skin becomes dry, it also may become more sensitive and prone to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rashes</a> and skin breakdown. The medical term for dry skin is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/xerosis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">xerosis</a>. Simple <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prevention</a> and treatment measures are very effective in the treatment of dry skin. Basic dry skin prevention steps include avoidance of harsh soaps and chemical cleansers. Treatment generally requires more frequent and regular applications of bland emollients and moisturizers. Untreated, dry skin may result in complications, including, eczematous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dermatitis</a>, secondary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bacterial infections</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cellulitis</a>, and skin discoloration. Fortunately, dry skin is usually mild and can be easily remedied.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_dry_skin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no single cause of dry skin. Dry skin causes can be classified as external and internal. External factors are the most common underlying cause and are the easiest to address. External factors include cold temperatures and low humidity, especially during the winter when central heaters are used. Internal factors include overall health, age, genetics, family history, and a personal history of other medical conditions like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atopic_dermatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atopic dermatitis</a>. In particular those with certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thyroid diseases</a> are more prone to developing dry skin.</p>.<p>External factors that cause dry skin include</p>.<p>Although bathing and showering adds water to skin, it is the evaporation of this water after the completion of the immersion that results in dry skin. Skin that feels overly tight after bathing may indicate excess removal of water and natural skin oils.</p>.<p>One of the most common factors causing dry skin is frequent application of harsh soaps. The type of soap may have a large impact on dry skin. Soap is an emulsifier that removes oils on the skin. The more often skin is scrubbed with soap, the more oil is removed, ultimately resulting in dryer skin. Excessive use of soaps can worsen dry skin.</p>.<p>Moreover, dry skin may persist or worsen if using moisturizers improperly or choosing an inadequate moisturizer. Sometimes, the material of different clothing can also affect dry skin. Some materials such as wool or synthetic fibers tend to irritate the skin and worsen dry skin.</p>.<p>Dry skin condition may be caused by taking some medicines, as well. Some examples are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_frequently_asked_questions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high cholesterol</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acne</a> medications. Occasionally, a dry skin problem can be a sign of an internal medical condition. For instance, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> may inherently make people more prone to dry skin. In addition, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypothyroidism</a>, and malnutrition are all associated with dry skin.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_signs_and_symptoms_of_dry_skin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The key symptom of dry skin is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>. People who have dry skin can often find rough, dry, red patches on their skin, and these patches are often <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itchy</a>. Typical skin areas affected include arms, hands, lower legs, abdomen, and areas of friction such as ankles and soles.

Itching can lead to the development of the "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itch</a>-scratch" cycle. That is, as a person feels itchy, he or she scratches in response, which exacerbates the itch, and so on. The itch-scratch cycle is often seen when conscious control of scratching is low or absent, for instance during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>.</p>.<p>Most common dry skin areas are</p>.<p>Constantly scratching and rubbing the skin may cause the skin to become thick and leathery. For others, small, red, raised <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bumps</a> may appear on their skin, and these bumpy spots can be irritated, opened, and infected if scratched.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_dry_skin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Generally, dry skin can be easily diagnosed when the physician visually inspects the skin. While dry skin can appear on any type of skin at any age, the elderly and individuals who frequently expose their skin to soaps or detergents are more prone to developing this condition. In addition, a thorough medical history and review of the family history can help support the diagnosis of dry skin. Based on the medical history, other medical conditions may be ruled out or considered. In more difficult cases, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">skin biopsy</a> may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and direct the treatment plan.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="does_dry_skin_cause_winter_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Winter itch is a common name for the skin symptom of generalized itching in the winter.
