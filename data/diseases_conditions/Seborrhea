<p><b><a name="dandruff_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Those unpleasant white flakes on the collar of your dark shirt or blouse are dandruff. Dandruff is a sign that the skin of the scalp is peeling off (exfoliating). It is perfectly normal for the skin to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_and_beauty_antiaging_tips_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">exfoliate</a>. The problem arises when the amount of dandruff becomes an eyesore. There are basically two reasons for this. Too much production or not effective removal. In the too much production category are inflammatory diseases of the scalp. In the ineffective removal category is inadequate scalp hygienic efforts.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialties_of_doctors_treat_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary-care providers and nurse practitioners are be able to diagnose and treat most cases of dandruff. Dermatologists are experts in skin diseases.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_dandruff_what_are_dandruff_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dandruff itself produces no symptoms. However, the most common cause of dandruff, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seborrheic_dermatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seborrheic dermatitis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dandruff_seborrhea_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">seborrhea</a>), is an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itchy</a> red <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> that tends to occur on the scalp, ears, face, mid-chest, and mid-back. The cause of seborrhea is unknown, although a yeast that often lives on the skin, <i>Malassezia furfur</i>, may play a role.</p>.<p>The most common secondary manifestation of seborrhea of the scalp is dandruff. Seborrhea produces plaques of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itchy</a> red skin with scaling. It is the accumulated scale that we call dandruff. Reddish, scaly plaques may also appear in the eyebrows, on the forehead, in the ear canal, on the folds of skin that extend from the nostril to the commissure of the lips. Although skin affected by seborrhea may feel and look dry, this is not the case; moisturizers are of little help in its control.</p>.<p>Scalp seborrhea may slow hair growth but does not cause permanent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hair loss</a>. Often, scalp seborrhea doesn't even itch significantly. Seborrhea can appear during infancy, starting shortly after birth and lasting several months. It may affect the scalp ("<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/cradle_cap_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">cradle cap</a>") or produce scaly plaques on the body. Seborrhea may occur at any age.</p>.<p>Some people who have weakened immune systems, such as those on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> or those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> disease or certain neurological disorders, may have very severe seborrhea. It is important to emphasize, however, that seborrhea is a very common condition, affecting perhaps 5% of the population (with men predominating). The vast majority of those who have it are completely healthy and have no internal or immune problems.</p>.<p>There are a variety of other inflammatory diseases that can produce excessive scaling and therefore dandruff, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a>, fungal infection of the scalp skin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tinea capitis</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/allergic_contact_dermatitis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">allergic contact dermatitis</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_doctors_diagnose_the_cause_of_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After a thorough scalp examination, the cause of most cases of dandruff is usually apparent. Occasionally, physicians may find it necessary to perform a scalp biopsy where a small amount of scalp skin is removed under local anesthesia and submitted for examination under a microscope.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatments_are_available_for_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of seborrhea (dandruff) is directed at fighting the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin inflammation</a>. This is done either directly, by using cortisone-based creams and lotions (which reduce inflammation), or by using topical anti-yeast lotions and shampoos. Treatment should be directed at the cause of the dandruff.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_doesn#39t_help_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_home_remedies_for_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As with shampoos, creams should be applied until the seborrhea subsides. When the seborrhea comes back (and it will, sooner or later), the creams should be used again.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="if_over-the-counter_products_don#39t_work_what_can_the_doctor_prescribe_for_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A primary-care physician or dermatologist can recommend prescription-strength shampoos or antifungal and corticosteroid creams that are stronger than those available over the counter, yet are not too strong to use on the face. There also are corticosteroid-based liquids, gels, and foams that one can apply to the scalp that won't leave the hair limp and matted. Nonsteroid preparations like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tacrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tacrolimus</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tacrolimus_ointment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Protopic</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pimecrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">pimecrolimus</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pimecrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Elidel</a>) may also help.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most simple uncomplicated dandruff responds to frequent shampooing. As with all seborrhea (dandruff) treatments, medicated shampoos and cortisone creams calm down the skin or scalp sensitivity, but they can't permanently stop the seborrhea (dandruff) from coming back. Most people, however, only have to treat their condition from time to time when it becomes itchy or noticeable.</p>.<p>Dandruff (seborrhea) of the eyelashes can be both annoying and hard to treat. Eye doctors like to recommend scrubbing the lashes with baby shampoo on a cotton swab. Corticosteroid-based lotions should be used close to the eye only under medical supervision since continuous exposure of the eye to these products can lead to serious <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eye problems</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_dandruff" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Frequent shampooing will prevent most cases of dandruff.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
