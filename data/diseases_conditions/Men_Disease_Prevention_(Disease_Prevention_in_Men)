Additionally, there is no agreement on the effectiveness of screening or that the potential benefits of screening tests outweigh the risks.</p>.<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer_screening/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostate cancer screening</a> in men younger than age 75 years and that screening should not be carried out in men age 75 years or older.</p>.<p>The purpose of the screening is to detect early, tiny, or even microscopic cancers that are confined to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostate gland</a>. Early treatment of these malignancies (cancers) can stop the growth, prevent the spread, and possibly cure the cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive that screening and treatment of early and localized prostate cancer is beneficial; some elderly men may live with prostate cancer for many years and die from other conditions rather than from the prostate cancer, and the measures undertaken for diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (surgery, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation therapy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a>, or hormones) can have side effects and serious complications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> associated with the biopsy procedure, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">erectile dysfunction</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary incontinence</a>, bowel dysfunction, and death.
