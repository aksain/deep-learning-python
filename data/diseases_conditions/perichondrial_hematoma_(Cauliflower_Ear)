<p><b><a name="what_is_cauliflower_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_cauliflower_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The ear is vulnerable to blunt trauma. When the ear is struck and a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clot</a> develops under the skin, or the skin is sheared from the cartilage, the connection of the skin to the cartilage is disrupted, causing cauliflower ear. </p>.<p>The cartilage of the ear has no other blood supply except that supplied by the overlying skin. When the skin is pulled from the cartilage, and/or separated from the cartilage by blood (as with accumulated blood from injury or inflammation, or infection), the cartilage is deprived of important nutrients. Ultimately, the cartilage dies and the risk of infection is increased.</p>.<p>Untreated, the ear cartilage contracts on itself forming a shriveled up outer ear, known as the cauliflower ear deformity. Once cartilage death and scarring (fibrosis) 
occurs, the resulting deformity is generally permanent. The ear may also appear pale, due to loss of blood supply. In some cases, cosmetic procedures may improve the appearance of the ear. </p>.<p>Cartilage damage may also result from piercing the upper ear in the cartilage. Piercing can lead to a type of ear cartilage infection called auricular perichondritis, which can result in cauliflower ear.  An even more rare cause of cauliflower ear is from the inflammation of cartilage in relapsing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/relapsing_polychondritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">polychondritis</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_cauliflower_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because cauliflower ear is usually due to trauma, the symptoms depend on the severity of the trauma to the ear.<br><br>Common symptoms of acute cauliflower ear</p>.<p>Severe symptoms of cauliflower ear</p>.<p>If the damage from the trauma is severe and medical attention should be sought immediately. Once scarring and deformity of the cartilage occurs, there may be no symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_cauliflower_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The goals of treatment are to prevent permanent damage to the cartilage by draining blood from the hematoma, treating any infection, and reducing inflammation in order to re-establish the connection of the skin to the underlying cartilage. 
Antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection.</p>.<p>Patients may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat doctor (otolaryngologist) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> surgeon to treat this deformity and assure proper healing.</p>.<p>
Cauliflower ear repair consists of draining accumulated blood (the hematoma) through an incision in the ear and applying a compressive dressing to sandwich the two sides of the skin against the cartilage. 
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_cauliflower_ear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When treated aggressively and promptly, cauliflower ear deformity is unlikely. Any delay in diagnosis leads to more difficulty in managing the problem, increased chances for insufficient blood supply to the ear cartilage, and escalated risk of deformity.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_cauliflower_ear_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Protective headgear and helmets worn during sporting activities can help prevent this condition.
