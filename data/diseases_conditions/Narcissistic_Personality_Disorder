<p><b><a name="narcissistic_personality_disorder_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_narcissistic_personality_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In order to understand narcissistic personality disorder, the concept of 
personality is important. As with normal personality, that of the person with 
narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has a pervasive way of thinking, feeling, 
and interacting with others that tends to be fairly established and fixed by the 
time the individual reaches adulthood. A narcissist is someone who has therefore 
established a pattern of being fixated on him- or herself that permeates their 
thoughts, feelings, actions, and relationships.</p>.<p>The word <i>narcissism</i> comes from the story of Narcissus, a hunter in Greek 
mythology, who was well known for his <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beauty_and_body_image/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">beauty</a> and for being completely in love 
with himself. His all-consuming self-love resulted in his eventual death, caused 
by his becoming so attracted to his own reflection in a pool that he was unable 
to stop staring at his image.</p>.<p>People with narcissistic personality disorder tend to interact with others 
and the world in general by distorting things such that they alternate between 
feeling omnipotent or devalued. Narcissistic personality disorder has an average 
occurrence rate of about 1% of the population but has been found to 
occur as often as in 6% of adults.</p>.<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is diagnosed more often in men than in 
women. It is also more often found in people who are involved with the court 
system compared to the general public. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antisocial_personality_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Antisocial personality disorder</a> is an 
illness that commonly co-occurs with narcissistic personality 
disorder.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_narcissistic_personality_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As with most mental-health disorders, narcissistic personality disorder does 
not have one single definitive cause. Rather, people with this illness tend to 
have biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to 
its development. Biologically, narcissists are thought to have a tendency to 
have a smaller part of the brain that is related to having empathy for others.</p>.<p>Psychologically, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder tend to 
have trouble having opposing self-images of excessive admiration and devaluing 
in their minds and in their relationships. 
They are thought to be excessively emotionally sensitive.</p>.<p>Early psychoanalytic theory on the emotional motivations for the development 
of narcissistic personality disorder focused on the relationship between mothers 
and sons. Specifically, it was thought that men develop this disorder as the 
result of having an excessively close relationship with their mother that is 
contingent upon always doing what she wants, with a resulting paranoid fear of 
being retaliated against by their father and humiliated or abandoned by their 
mother. Since those early theories, the social risk 
factors for developing NPD have been expanded to include excessive admiration or 
neglect by either parent.</p>.<p>In addition to receiving excessive, unrealistic admiration, praise, and 
overindulgence, or excessive criticism for misbehavior during childhood, 
theories about other social risk factors of narcissistic personality disorder 
include emotional abuse, unpredictable parental care, and learning manipulation 
from caregivers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_narcissistic_personality_disorder_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In order to be assessed with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality 
disorder, an individual must demonstrate a pervasive pattern of significantly 
inflated self esteem (grandiosity), a need to be admired and lack of empathy for 
others that begins by early adulthood and is present in a number of different 
aspects of their life. Specific symptoms and signs of this illness can include 
the following:
</p>.<p>Individuals who have some symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder but 
not enough for the diagnosis to be assigned are often described as having 
narcissistic traits.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_narcissistic_personality_disorder_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many providers of health 
care may help make the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, including 
pediatricians, primary-care 
providers, licensed mental-health therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers. 
As part of this examination, the sufferer will likely be referred for a full 
physical examination and laboratory tests in an attempt to rule out any medical 
condition that may contribute to the symptoms described. The person with NPD may 
be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to 
help assess the presence of the illness. Thorough exploration for any history or 
presence of mental-health symptoms will be conducted such that narcissistic 
personality disorder can be distinguished from other personality disorders like 
histrionic personality disorder, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/borderline_personality_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">borderline personality disorder</a>, or antisocial 
personality disorder. The mental-health professional will also explore whether 
other forms of mental illness are present, since narcissism is often also 
associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> or perfectionism. In addition to demonstrating a 
pattern of grandiose thoughts or behaviors, need for admiration, and lack of 
empathy for others characterized by at least five of the previously described 
symptoms, other diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder 
include the sufferer's pattern of such behaviors being pervasive throughout the 
person's life, as well as stable, longstanding symptoms that are not better 
explained by another mental illness, the effects of a substance, or a medical 
condition.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_narcissistic_personality_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The primary treatment for narcissistic personality disorder is talk therapy 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psychotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">psychotherapy</a>) rather than medication. However, medication may be appropriate 
to address some co-occurring mental-health symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, 
irritability, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>. Psychotherapy tends to focus on how the person with the 
disorder interacts with the therapist during therapy, examining and changing 
grandiose and excessively vulnerable thinking, teaching the sufferer ways to 
regulate their emotions, and correcting self-centered behaviors to more 
prosocial ways of interacting with others.
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_narcissistic_personality_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>How well or 
poorly people with narcissistic personality disorder progress over time seems to 
be influenced by how severe the disorder is at the time that treatment starts, 
the state of the individual's current personal relationships, whether or not the 
sufferer has a history of being abused as a child, as well as whether or not the 
person receives appropriate treatment. Simultaneously suffering from other 
mental-health problems has been found to be associated with a lower likelihood 
of symptoms of NPD being alleviated with treatment. One of the major obstacles 
to treatment and therefore to a good prognosis for narcissistic individuals is 
the perception by these individuals that their problems are caused by others 
rather than by their own self-centered tendencies.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_narcissistic_personality_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Societal interventions like
