Patrick, MD, PhD</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency_aatd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a disorder that causes a deficiency or absence of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein in the blood. AAT is made in the liver and sent through the bloodstream to the lungs, to protect the lungs from damage. Having low levels of ATT (or no ATT) can allow the lungs to become damaged, making <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> hard. Age of onset and severity of AATD can vary based on how much ATT an affected person is missing. In adults, symptoms may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shortness of breath</a>; reduced ability to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wheezing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">wheezing</a>; respiratory infections; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>; vision problems; and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>. Some people have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">COPD</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a>. Liver disease (cirrhosis) may occur in affected children or adults. Rarely, AATD can cause a skin condition called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erythema_nodosum/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">panniculitis</a>.[1] AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene and is inherited in a codominant manner.[2] Treatment is based on each person's symptoms and may include bronchodilators; antibiotics for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/upper_respiratory_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">upper respiratory tract infections</a>; intravenous therapy of AAT; and/or lung transplantation in severe cases.[1][3]</p>.<p><b><a name="chart_of_signs_and_symptoms_of_lung_and_liver_disease_caused_by_aatd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by population. This disorder affects about 1 in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals with European ancestry. It is uncommon in people of Asian descent. Many individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are likely undiagnosed, particularly people with a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD can be caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; however, the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is often never diagnosed. Some people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are misdiagnosed with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthma</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_gene_mutations_cause_alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.</p>.<p>The SERPINA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin. This protein protects the body from being damaged by a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues (such as lung tissue) if not carefully controlled by alpha-1 antitrypsin. Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein or an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase. Uncontrolled, neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli, which can lead to emphysema. The abnormal form of alpha-1 antitrypsin can also accumulate in the liver and may damage this organ.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_aatd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>AATD may first be suspected in people with evidence of liver disease at any age, or lung disease (such as emphysema), especially when there is no obvious cause or it is diagnosed at a younger age.</p>.<p>Confirming the diagnosis involves a blood test showing a low serum concentration of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, and either:</p>.<p>Specialists involved in the diagnosis may include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and/or hepatologists (liver specialists).[4]</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency_treatment_and_management_guidelines" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) depends on the symptoms and severity in each person. COPD and other related lung diseases are typically treated with standard therapy.[3][4] Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids can help open the airways and make breathing easier.[4]</p>.<p>Intravenous augmentation therapy (regular infusion of purified, human AAT to increase AAT concentrations) has been recommended for people with established fixed airflow obstruction (determined by a specific lung function test).[3] This therapy raises the level of the AAT protein in the blood and lungs.[4]</p>.<p>Lung transplantation may be an appropriate option for people with end-stage lung disease. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for advanced liver disease.[3]</p>.<p>When present, panniculitis may resolve on its own or after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dapsone_dds-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dapsone</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxycycline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">doxycycline</a> therapy. When this therapy does not help, it has responded to intravenous augmentation therapy in higher than usual doses.[3]</p>.<p>All people with severe AATD should have pulmonary function tests every 6 to 12 months. Those with ATT serum concentrations 10% to 20% of normal should have periodic evaluation of liver function to detect liver disease. People with established liver disease should have periodic ultrasounds of the liver to monitor for fibrotic changes and liver <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> (hepatocellular carcinoma).[3]</p>.<p>Yearly vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus are recommended to lessen the progression of lung disease. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is recommended to lessen the risk of liver disease. People with AATD should avoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">smoking</a> and occupations with exposure to environmental pollutants.[3]</p>.<p>Parents, older and younger siblings, and children of a person with severe AATD should be evaluated to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and preventive measures.[3]</p>.<p><b><a name="fda_approved_treatment_medications_for_aatd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition.</p>.<p><strong>Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human) (Brand name: Prolastin)</strong> - Manufactured by Grifols United States: FDA-approved indication: For chronic replacement therapy of individuals having congenital deficiency of alpha1- proteinase inhibitor with clinically demonstrable panacinar emphysema.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="whats_the_prognosis_and_life_expectancy_for_a_person_with_aatd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of a genetic condition includes its likely course, duration, and outcome. When health professionals refer to the prognosis of a disease, they may also mean the chance of recovery; however, most genetic conditions are life-long and are managed rather than cured.</p>.<p>Disease prognosis has multiple aspects, including:</p>.<p>The prognosis of a genetic condition depends on many factors, including the specific diagnosis and an individual's particular signs and symptoms. Sometimes the associated genetic change, if known, can also give clues to the prognosis. Additionally, the course and outcome of a condition depends on the availability and effectiveness of treatment and management approaches. The prognosis of very rare diseases can be difficult to predict because so few affected individuals have been identified. Prognosis may also be difficult or impossible to establish if a person's diagnosis is unknown.</p>.<p>The prognoses of genetic disorders vary widely, often even among people with the same condition. Some genetic disorders cause physical and developmental problems that are so severe they are incompatible with life. These conditions may cause a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">miscarriage</a> of an affected embryo or fetus, or an affected infant may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. People with less severe genetic conditions may live into childhood or adulthood but have a shortened lifespan due to health problems related to their disorder. Genetic conditions with a milder course may be associated with a normal lifespan and few related health issues.</p>.<p>The prognosis of a disease is based on probability, which means that it is likely but not certain that the disorder will follow a particular course. Your healthcare provider is the best resource for information about the prognosis of your specific genetic condition. He or she can assess your medical history and signs and symptoms to give you the most accurate estimate of your prognosis.</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_information_about_treatment_for_alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These resources address the management of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and may include treatment providers.</p>
