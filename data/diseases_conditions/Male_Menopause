<p><b><a name="male_menopause_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women may not be the only ones who suffer the effects of changing hormones. Some doctors are noticing that their male patients are reporting some of the same symptoms that women experience in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">perimenopause</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>.
</p>.<p>
The medical community is currently debating whether or not men really do go through a well-defined <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause_and_perimenopause_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>. Doctors say that male patients receiving <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hormone therapy</a> with testosterone have reported relief of some of the symptoms associated with so-called male <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_male_menopause" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because men do not go through a well-defined period referred to as menopause, some doctors refer to this problem as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_testosterone_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">androgen</a> (testosterone) decline in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> male, or what some people call <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_testosterone_low_t/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low testosterone</a>. Men do experience a decline in the production of the male hormone testosterone with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a>, but this also occurs with conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>. Along with the decline in testosterone, some men experience symptoms that include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, and sexual problems. The relationship of these symptoms to decreased testosterone levels is still controversial.
</p>.<p>
Unlike menopause in women, when hormone production stops completely, testosterone decline in men is a slower process. The testes, unlike the ovaries, do not run out of the substance it needs to make testosterone. A healthy male may be able to make sperm well into his eighties or longer.
</p>.<p>
However, as a result of disease, subtle changes in the function of the testes may occur as early as 45 to 50 years of age, and more dramatically after the age of 70 in some men.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_male_menopause_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To make the diagnosis of male menopause, the doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. He or she may order other diagnostic tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the condition. The doctor will then order a series of blood tests, which may include measuring testosterone level.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_male_menopause_be_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If testosterone levels are low, testosterone replacement therapy may help relieve such symptoms as loss of interest in sex (decreased libido), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>. But, as with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hormone replacement therapy</a> in women, testosterone replacement therapy has potential risks and side effects. Replacing testosterone may worsen <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostate cancer</a>, for example.
</p>.<p>
If you or a loved one is considering androgen replacement therapy, talk to a doctor to learn more. Your doctor may also recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as a new <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> program, or other medications, such as an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antidepressant</a>, to help with some of the symptoms of male menopause.
