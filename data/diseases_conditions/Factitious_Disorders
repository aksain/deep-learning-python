There are four main types of factitious disorders, including:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_factitious_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Possible warning signs of factitious disorders include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_factitious_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
The exact cause of factitious disorders is not known, but researchers are 
looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in the development 
of these disorders. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as 
a child, or a history of frequent illnesses that required hospitalization might 
be factors in the development of the disorder. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_are_factitious_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in 
		the U.S. who suffer from factitious disorders. Obtaining accurate 
		statistics is difficult because dishonesty is common with this 
		condition. In addition, people with factitious disorders tend to seek 
		treatment at many different health care facilities, which can lead to 
		statistics that are misleading. </p>.<p>In general, factitious disorders are more common in men than in 
		women. However, factitious disorder by proxy tends to be more common in 
		women than in men. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_factitious_disorders_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diagnosing factitious disorders is very difficult because of, again, 
		the dishonesty that is involved. Doctors must rule out other possible 
		physical and mental illnesses before a diagnosis of factitious disorder 
		can be considered. </p>.<p>If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, he or she 
		may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mental health</a> 
		professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental 
		illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed 
		interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a factitious 
		disorder. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on the exclusion of 
		actual physical or mental illness, and his or her observation of the 
		person's attitude and behavior. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_factitious_disorders_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p> The first goal of treatment for a factitious disorder is to modify the 
person's behavior and reduce his or her misuse or overuse of medical resources. 
In the case of factitious disorder by proxy, the main goal is to ensure the 
safety and protection of any real or potential victims. Once the initial goal is 
met, treatment aims to work out any underlying psychological issues that may be 
causing the person's behavior. 
		</p>.<p>The primary treatment for factitious disorders is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psychotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">psychotherapy</a> (a 
		type of counseling). Treatment likely will focus on changing the 
		thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder 
		(cognitive-behavioral therapy). Family therapy may also be helpful in 
		teaching family members not to reward or reinforce the behavior of the 
		person with the disorder. </p>.<p>There are no medications to treat factitious disorders themselves. 
		Medication may be used, however, to treat any related disorder -- such 
		as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>, or a personality disorder. The use of 
		medications must be carefully monitored in people with factitious 
		disorders due to the risk that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> may be used in a harmful way.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_outlook_for_people_with_factitious_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with factitious disorders are at risk for health problems (or 
		even death) associated with hurting themselves or otherwise causing 
		symptoms. In addition, they may suffer from reactions or health problems 
		related to multiple tests, procedures, and treatments; and are at high 
		risk for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">substance abuse</a> and attempts at <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">suicide</a>. A complication of 
		factitious disorder by proxy is the abuse and potential death of the 
		victims. </p>.<p>Because many people with factitious disorders deny they are faking 
		symptoms and will not seek or follow treatment, recovery is dependent on 
		a doctor or loved one identifying or suspecting the condition in the 
		person and encouraging them to receive proper medical care for their 
		disorder and stick with it. </p>.<p>Some people with factitious disorders suffer one or two brief 
		episodes of symptoms and then get better. In most cases, however, the 
		factitious disorder is a chronic, or long-term, condition that can be 
		very difficult to treat. </p>.<p><b><a name="can_factitious_disorders_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
