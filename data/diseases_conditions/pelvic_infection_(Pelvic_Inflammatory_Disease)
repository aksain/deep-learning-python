Most of the time, at least two antibiotics are used that work against many different types of bacteria. <b>You must take all of your antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away.</b> This helps to make sure the infection is fully cured. See your doctor or nurse again two to three days after starting the antibiotics to make sure they are working.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_i_think_i_have_an_sti_sexually_transmitted_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>If you think you may have an STI, see a doctor right away.</b> You may feel scared or shy about asking for information or help.

And the sooner you tell your sex partner(s) that you have an STI, the less likely they are to infect you again or spread the disease to others.

The American Social Health Association (ASHA) keeps lists of clinics and doctors who provide treatment for STIs. Call ASHA at 800-227-8922.

You can also prevent STIs by not having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps: </p>
