<p><b><a name="salmonella_food_poisoning_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_salmonella_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Salmonella</i> infection, or salmonellosis, is another name for <i>Salmonella</i> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">food poisoning</a>. <i>Salmonella</i> are a type of bacteria 
known to cause food-borne illness for over 125 years. The organism is named for 
a scientist named Daniel Elmer Salmon, who discovered the bacteria. 
Salmonellosis is a food-borne infection typically caused by consumption of 
contaminated foods. <i>Salmonella</i> causes an estimated 1 million food-borne illnesses every year in the U.S. and about 19,000 hospitalizations.</p>.<p>Different types (called serotypes 
or serovars) of the <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria can cause the illness. The two most common serotypes in the U.S. are <i>S. typhimurium</i> and <i>S. enteritidis</i>. Specific strains of the bacteria can be responsible for outbreaks of the disease. For example, an outbreak in 2013-2014 was linked to multidrug-resistant serotype <i>Salmonella </i>Heidelberg. This strain and some other strains have become resistant to many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> traditionally used to treat the infection, posing a risk to public health.</p>.<p>Some types of <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria 
(<i>S. typhi</i>) cause typhoid fever, a serious illness that occurs most often in nonindustrialized areas of the world.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_salmonella_outbreaks_how_does_salmonella_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Poultry, beef, milk, and eggs may contain <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria, since the bacteria live in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> of humans and animals. Thorough cooking of these foods destroys the bacteria.</p>.<p>Foods, including vegetables and fruits, may also be contaminated during handling or processing of the food, and this is another common source of outbreaks. For example, food may be contaminated by the feces of infected people or animals or from the unwashed hands of a person handling or preparing the food.</p>.<p>Small rodents such as hamsters, as well as baby chicks and ducklings, may also carry the bacteria, and contamination of food after handling these animals may also result in salmonellosis. Reptiles may also harbor <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria. In the 1970s, outbreaks were associated with baby turtles kept as pets. Further, the infection may be spread by contaminated surfaces (such as cutting boards) that have had contact with contaminated foods.</p>.<p>Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Over the past years, outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with a number of different foods, including chicken, cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts, ground beef, mangoes, peanut butter, and cantaloupe. These are just a few examples. An outbreak in February 2016 caused by the strain <i>Salmonella muenchen</i> was linked to contaminated alfalfa sprouts. In 2017, an outbreak was linked to papayas from Mexico. A breakfast cereal known as Honey Smacks caused an outbreak in 2018.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_salmonella_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since foods contaminated with <i>Salmonella</i> are not obvious, anyone may consume contaminated foods. Owning pets such as small rodents, chicks, ducklings, 
small turtles and some other reptiles, and some birds may increase the risk of coming in contact with <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria. People who are exposed to many people, such as those living in group housing, may have an increased risk. Young children (under 5 years of age) have the highest reported incidence of infection.</p>.<p>People with medical conditions that lead to immune suppression are at risk for a more severe illness when they do become infected.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_salmonella_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Salmonella</i> illness causes an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; this is known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroenteritis</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_salmonella_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_incubation_period_for_a_salmonella_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms usually begin 12-72 hours after infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_contagious_period_for_salmonellosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Those with <i>Salmonella</i> infection can be contagious for days to weeks, even after symptoms have disappeared.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kinds_of_doctors_treat_salmonella_food_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Salmonellosis may be treated by primary care specialists, pediatricians, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> specialists, or internal medicine specialists.
