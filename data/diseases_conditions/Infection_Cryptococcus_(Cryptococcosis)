<p><b><a name="what_is_cryptococcus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Cryptococcus</i> is a type of fungus that is found in the soil worldwide, 
usually in association with bird droppings. The major species of <i>Cryptococcus</i> 
that causes illness in human is <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. Another less common 
species that can also cause disease in humans, <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i>, has been 
isolated from eucalyptus trees in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Since 1999, 
<i>C. gattii</i> has also been found in regions of the Pacific Northwest, particularly 
Victoria Island in British Columbia, and Oregon and Washington in the United 
States. </p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_cryptococcosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cryptococcosis is disease due to a species of the fungus <i>Cryptococcus</i>. 
<i>C. 
neoformans</i> typically infects immunocompromised persons. Most people in the 
United States who develop cryptococcal infections are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a>-positive. However, 
occasionally persons with no apparent immune system problems develop 
cryptococcosis. Infections with <i>C. gattii</i> have also occurred in healthy persons 
without compromised immune systems. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_cryptococcus_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Inhalation</a> of airborne fungi. Cryptococcosis is not known to be spread from 
person to person. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_cryptococcal_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cryptococcal infection may cause a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>-like illness, with shortness of 
breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>. Skin lesions may also occur. Another common form of 
cryptococcosis is central nervous system infection, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">meningoencephalitis</a>. 
People with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis are usually immunocompromised. 
Symptoms may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, or change in mental status. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_soon_do_symptoms_appear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Incubation times vary for infection due to <i>Cryptococcus</i> species. Symptoms 
from <i>C. gattii</i> infection are estimated to begin anywhere from 2-11 months after 
exposure. The incubation time for <i>C. neoformans</i> is not known. </p>.<p><b><a name="if_i_have_symptoms_should_i_see_my_doctor" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, it is very important to seek immediate medical evaluation. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_cryptococcal_infection_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis can be made by microscopic examination and/or culture of tissue 
or body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid and sputum. The cryptococcal 
antigen test is a rapid test that can be performed on blood and/or on 
cerebrospinal fluid to make the diagnosis. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_cryptococcal_infections_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of meningoencephalitis and other severe infections is usually 
initiated with an amphotericin B formulation, with or without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flucytosine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flucytosine</a>.

droppings. People who have weakened immune systems should avoid areas 
contaminated by bird droppings, and should avoid contact with birds. There are
