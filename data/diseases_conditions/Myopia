<p><b><a name="introduction_to_myopia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Myopia (or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/nearsightedness_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nearsightedness</a>) affects 20% to 30% of the population, but this eye disorder is easily corrected with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eyeglasses_sunglasses_and_magnifiers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eyeglasses</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contact lenses</a> or surgery.</p>.<p>People who have myopia or nearsightedness have difficulty seeing distant objects, but can see objects that are near clearly. For example, a person who is nearsighted may not be able to make out highway signs until they are just a few <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> away.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_myopia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who are nearsighted have what is called a refractive error. This means that the light rays bend incorrectly into the eye to transmit images to the brain. In people with myopia, the eyeball is too long or the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cornea</a> has too much curvature, so the light entering the eye is not focused correctly. Light rays of images focus in front of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">retina</a>, the light-sensitive part of the eye, rather than directly on the retina, causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blurred_vision/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blurred vision</a>.</p>.<p>Myopia runs in families and usually appears in childhood. Sometimes the condition plateaus, or sometimes it worsens with age.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_myopia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who are nearsighted often complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>, eyestrain, squinting or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> when driving, playing sports, or looking more than a few feet away.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_myopia_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Myopia can be easily diagnosed using standard eye exams given by an eye doctor.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_myopia_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery can correct myopia.</p>.<p>With myopia, your prescription for glasses or contact <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lens</a> is a negative number, such as -3.00. The higher the number, the stronger your lenses will be.</p>.<p>Refractive surgery can reduce or even eliminate your dependence on glasses or contact lenses. The most common procedures for myopia are performed with a laser, including:</p>.<p class="credits">Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>
