<p><b><a name="tongue_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The tongue is made up of a mobile group of muscles that is attached to the floor of the mouth. The top of the tongue is covered with small <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a> called papillae. The majority of our taste buds are in these papillae.</p>.<p>The tongue is used for tasting, swallowing, and chewing food. The tongue is also used to form words for speaking. Typically, a tongue that is pink and moist with a thin slightly white, shiny coating on the surface is considered healthy. There are variations of surface texture that are normal and healthy as well. As many of us have experienced, a tongue injury (such as when we accidentally bite our tongue) can be quite painful since the tongue is such an instrumental part of our daily lives through eating and speaking. Though very few people know it, the tongue is actually a very good measure of the well-being of the body. This is why your doctor may use the tongue depressor to look in your mouth and tongue during an examination.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_common_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some common problems associated with the tongue include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a variety of causes of tongue problems, ranging from harmless to serious. Individuals can be born with a tongue condition that is harmless. A more serious condition such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tongue cancer</a> can be related to risk factors such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a> and drinking alcohol. Additionally, a tongue problem may be a result of an underlying medical condition.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending on the tongue problem, risk factors may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">smoking</a> tobacco, drinking alcohol, poor oral hygiene, viral infections, a weak immune system, and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="white_tongue" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Color changes related to the tongue can range from a benign concern to one that requires medical attention. Often, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/white_tongue/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">white tongue</a> could be caused by a removable coating of food debris or bacterial plaque. Otherwise, the following are some common causes of white tongue: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrush_oral_candidiasis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">oral thrush</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukoplakia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leukoplakia</a>, oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lichen_planus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lichen planus</a>, hairy leukoplakia, and linea alba.</p>.<p>Oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrush/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thrush</a> (or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/candidiasis_moniliasis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">candidiasis</a>) is caused by an overgrowth of yeast fungus in the mouth. The white patches can be scraped off to expose a red surface on the tongue. Illnesses, medications, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a>, and antibiotic treatment can cause oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrush_oral_candidiasis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">thrush</a> by throwing off the balance of natural bacteria in the mouth. Those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> are more prone to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fungal_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">fungal infections</a>, such as oral thrush. Lozenges, tablets, or liquid antifungals are used for treatment.</p>.<p>Leukoplakia is characterized by white patches that cannot be scraped off and may be related to chronic irritation in the mouth, although the cause is not always known. Tobacco use is the most common factor that contributes to leukoplakia. The condition may resolve after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking cessation</a>. Sometimes the patches are on the sides of the tongue and could be related to constant rubbing next to the lower <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">teeth</a>. Although leukoplakia is usually benign, it can also be the precursor to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">oral cancer</a>. The risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> increases with the age of the individual, size of the lesion, and number of lesions present. A biopsy may be recommended after clinical evaluation by the doctor. Sometimes, the area can be monitored for changes by the doctor. Monitoring is usually performed during routine dental visits or during visits with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.</p>.<p>Oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lichen_planus_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lichen planus</a> on the tongue is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by an autoimmune response (the body's immune system attacking its own tissue). It is characterized by a white lace-like pattern called reticular lichen planus. (There is an erosive form that presents as shallow ulcerations and can be treated with topical steroids.) Regular monitoring of this condition is recommended for any changes that (although rare) could lead to oral cancer. A biopsy may be recommended.</p>.<p>Hairy leukoplakia is a white patch on the side of the tongue that appears hairy or rough. This condition is caused by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epstein-barr_virus_ebv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Epstein-Barr virus</a> and is usually related to immunocompromised individuals. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_testing/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">HIV testing</a> should be considered if hairy leukoplakia appears without a known immune-compromising condition. Antiviral medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acyclovir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zovirax</a>) may be used. Recurrence of hairy leukoplakia is common.</p>.<p>Linea alba is a benign condition that is characterized by a thin white line at the lateral (side) borders of the tongue. It is caused by the thickening of the epithelium due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> or irritation from chewing. No treatment is necessary for linea alba.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="red_tongue" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are obvious causes of red color change of the tongue, such as something you ate (strawberries or red-colored foods). Some acidic foods can cause temporary redness and discomfort. However, a discolored red tongue can be a sign of an underlying medical condition. Some red color changes on the tongue ("strawberry tongue") could be related to a vitamin deficiency, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kawasaki_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Kawasaki disease</a>, or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/streptococcal_infections/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strep</a> infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scarlet_fever_scarlatina/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scarlet fever</a>).</p>.<p>Erythroplakia is a red area or lesion that cannot be rubbed off on the tongue (except for the color, it is similar to leukoplakia). A lesion with a combined white and red appearance is called erythroleukoplakia. These lesions are all considered to have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">premalignant</a> potential. Erythroplakia and erythroleukoplakia have an increased risk of premalignancy compared to leukoplakia. In addition to appearance, there is concern if the lesion or sore does not go away or grows in size. A biopsy is recommended by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">oral surgeon</a> or an ENT specialist to rule out oral cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="black_tongue" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A black tongue is usually a harmless condition that can be caused by medications, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">smoking</a>, poor oral hygiene, soft <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a>.

Because the tongue is vital for sucking, infants with ankyloglossia may be unable to breastfeed properly. For toddlers and older children, sometimes the tongue is able to compensate for most oral functions, but speech may be affected.

The soreness could also be in combination with geographic tongue where bare areas are present and disappear as well as reappear. These conditions usually resolve after the pregnancy ends.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specialists_treat_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending on the tongue problem, there is a specific doctor for treatment. Initially, evaluation of tongue problems can be assessed by a dentist and if needed, an appropriate specialist can be recommended for further evaluation and subsequent treatment.</p>.<p>For tongue lesions such as changes in color, growths, or texture changes, an oral surgeon or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist, also known as an ENT specialist) can evaluate the area, perform a biopsy, and follow up or refer for appropriate treatment such as surgery or medication. Tongue pain may also be addressed with an oral surgeon or ENT, but a neurology specialist may be appropriate if the pain is related to neuralgia. Tongue movement problems stemming from injury may also be treated by a neurology specialist in conjunction with occupational or physical therapists.</p>.<p>For tongue cancer, a group of specialists could be involved depending on the spread of the disease. A head and neck surgeon, an oncologist, a radiation oncologist, an oral surgeon, and a dentist could comprise the team of doctors that help in treating the oral cancer patient.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During an examination with a physician or dentist, information based on symptoms and clinical appearance is collected. Imaging may also be needed to aid in diagnosis. The different imaging modalities include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a>), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). Based on the collective information, a diagnosis is made. However, if there isn't a unique sign or symptom to distinguish the tongue problem, a differential diagnosis is reviewed. A differential diagnosis lists all the possible causes of the signs and symptoms. It is a systematic process of weighing the probability of one disease versus that of other diseases that may account for the tongue problem. For example, a white tongue lesion may have the differential diagnosis of lichen planus, leukoplakia, or contact inflammation from dentures. Each of these causes can be carefully considered based on what is observed. Subsequently, a plan of treatment can be made.</p>.<p>For many tongue conditions that might be cancer, a special dye called toluidine blue has been useful to aid during the initial evaluation. Toluidine blue staining is able to help in early identification of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">precancerous</a> or cancerous lesions.</p>.<p>A more definite diagnosis requires a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure whereby a sample of cells or tissue is evaluated under a microscope.

"Burning tongue" pain may be alleviated with sucking on ice or bathing the tongue in cold water. Such home remedies, however, may provide only temporary relief.</p>.<p>For the most part, tongue conditions that appear to have no known cause (such as an obvious injury) should be evaluated by a physician or dentist for appropriate diagnosis, monitoring, and possible treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of a tongue problem depends on the underlying cause. For some tongue problems, no treatment is necessary whereas for other conditions, medications, surgery, or radiation may be needed. If the tongue issue is a result of an underlying medical condition, treatment of the underlying problem can be key to solving the problem.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some tongue problems are preventable by practicing good oral hygiene and eating a healthy, nutritious diet. Some tongue conditions cannot be prevented at all, but symptoms may be managed with treatment. Other tongue problems may be a byproduct of an underlying medical condition that needs to be addressed. For example, signs of an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> infection (or final stage of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV</a> infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acquired_immunodeficiency_syndrome_aids/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">AIDS</a>) often appear in the mouth along with other bodily symptoms. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv-aids_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">HIV</a> testing is important in determining if HIV treatment and care is needed.</p>.<p>Exercising moderation or altogether quitting the habit of smoking and drinking alcohol will decrease the risk of developing oral cancer.

Oral cancer screenings should always take place during routine dental visits. Screenings can also take place with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician. These oral cancer screenings involve an examination of all the soft tissues in the mouth, including the tongue, floor of the mouth (under the tongue), palate (roof of the mouth), inside of the cheeks, and throat area.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_tongue_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Fortunately, most tongue problems are benign and treatable. Therefore, the prognosis is generally very good.</p>.<p>In regard to growths on the tongue, the main concern is oral cancer. Early detection and treatment usually provides the best chance for recovery and survival. The prognosis for oral cancer is dependent upon the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread to blood vessels. Frequent follow-up and close monitoring are crucial parts of care. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis for oral cancer is generally poor. In the U.S., approximately half of individuals newly diagnosed with oral cancer do not survive after more than five years. Despite advances in treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the poor prognosis is due to the cancer being discovered at a later stage in its development.</p>.<p>When treating tongue cancer with surgery, the patient may experience the complication of numbness of the tongue. The numbness may or may not resolve. Radiation and chemotherapy treatment may also cause decreased saliva flow and changes in taste that may take time to improve or not improve at all.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
