<p><b><a name="what_is_the_liver_and_what_is_its_function" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> is the body's largest internal organ, weighing about 3 pounds in adults. It is located below the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diaphragm</a> on the right side of the abdomen.</p>.<p>The liver performs many complex functions in the body, including:</p>.<p><b><a name="when_is_a_liver_transplant_needed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Liver transplantation is considered when the liver no longer functions adequately (liver failure). Liver failure can occur suddenly (acute liver failure) as a result of infection or complications from certain medications or it can be the end result of a long-term problem. The following conditions may result in liver failure:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_candidates_for_liver_transplant_determined" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Evaluations by specialists from a variety of fields are needed to determine if a liver transplant is appropriate. The evaluation includes a review of your medical history and a variety of tests. Many healthcare facilities offer an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate and to select candidates for liver transplantation. This interdisciplinary healthcare team may include the following professionals:</p>.<p><b><a name="which_tests_are_required_before_getting_a_liver_transplant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You will need to bring all of your previous doctor records, X-rays, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_biopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver biopsy</a> slides and a record of medications to your pre-evaluation for a liver transplant. To complement and to update previous tests, some or all of the following diagnostic studies are generally performed during your evaluation.</p>.<p>If specific problems are identified, additional tests may be ordered.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_the_waiting_list_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you become an active liver transplant candidate, your name will be placed on a waiting list. Patients are listed according to blood type, body size, and medical condition (how ill they are). Each patient is given a priority score based on three simple blood tests (creatinine, bilirubin, and INR). The score is known as the MELD (model of end stage <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a>) score in adults and PELD (pediatric end stage <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a>) in children.</p>.<p>Patients with the highest scores are transplanted first. As they become more ill, their scores will increase and therefore their priority for transplant increases, allowing for the sickest patients to be transplanted first. A small group of patients who are critically ill from acute liver disease have the highest priority on the waiting list.</p>.<p>It is impossible to predict how long a patient will wait for a liver to become available. Your transplant coordinator is always available to discuss where you are on the waiting list.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="where_does_a_liver_for_a_transplant_come_from" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two types of liver transplant options: living donor transplant and deceased donor transplant.</p>.<p>Living donor liver transplants are an option for some patients with end-stage liver disease. This involves removing a segment of liver from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_living/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">healthy living</a> donor and implanting it into a recipient. Both the donor and recipient liver segments will grow to normal size in a few weeks 
to months.</p>.<p>The donor, who may be a blood relative, spouse, or friend, will have extensive medical and psychological evaluations to ensure the lowest possible risk. Blood type and body size are critical factors in determining who is an appropriate donor.</p>.<p>Recipients for the living donor transplant must be active on the transplant waiting list. Their health must also be stable enough to undergo transplantation with excellent chances of success.</p>.<p>In deceased donor liver transplant, the donor may be a victim of an accident or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">head injury</a>. The donor's heart is still beating, but the brain has stopped functioning. Such a person is considered legally dead, because his or her brain has permanently and irreversibly stopped working. At this point, the donor is usually in an intensive-care unit.</p>.<p>The identity of a deceased donor and circumstances surrounding the person's death are kept confidential.</p>.<p><b>Screening for Liver Transplant Donors</b></p>.<p>Hospitals will evaluate all potential liver transplant donors for evidence of liver disease, alcohol or drug abuse, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, or infection. Donors will also be tested for hepatitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">AIDS</a>, and other infections. If this screening does not reveal problems with the liver, donors and recipients are matched according to blood type and body size. Age, race, and sex are not considered.</p>.<p>The transplant team will discuss your transplantation options with you at the time of your pre-transplant evaluation, or you can contact the transplant team for more information.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_when_they_find_a_liver_transplant_match" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When a liver has been identified for you, a transplant coordinator will contact you by telephone or by pager. Make sure that you do not eat or drink anything once you have been called to the hospital. The transplant coordinator will notify you of any additional instructions. When you arrive at the hospital, additional blood tests, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrocardiogram</a>, and a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest X-ray</a> will generally be taken before the operation. You also may meet with the anesthesiologist and a surgical resident. If the donor liver is found to be acceptable you will proceed with the transplant. If not, you will be sent home to continue waiting.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_the_liver_transplant_operation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Liver transplants usually take from six hours to 12 hours. During the operation, surgeons will remove your liver and will replace it with the donor liver. Because a transplant operation is a major procedure, surgeons will need to place several tubes in your body. These tubes are necessary to help your body carry out certain functions during the operation and for a few days afterward.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_complications_are_associated_with_liver_transplantation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Two of the most common complications following liver transplant are rejection and infection.</p>.<p>Your immune system works to destroy foreign substances that invade your body. The immune system, however, cannot distinguish between your transplanted liver and unwanted invaders, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> and bacteria. Therefore, your immune system may attempt to attack and destroy your new liver. This is called a rejection episode. About 
25% of all liver-transplant patients have some degree of organ rejection prior to discharge. Anti-rejection medications are given to ward off the immune attack. 
More than 80% of transplanted livers are still functioning at the end of the 
first year.</p>.<p>Because anti-rejection <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> that suppress your immune system are needed to prevent the liver from being rejected, you are at increased risk for infections. This problem diminishes as time passes. Not all patients have problems with infections, and most infections can be treated successfully as they occur.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_antirejection_medications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After the liver transplant, you will receive medications called immunosuppressants. These medications slow or suppress your immune system to prevent it from rejecting your new liver. They may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azathioprine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">azathioprine</a> (Imuran), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mycophenolate_mofetil-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cellcept</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mycophenolate_mofetil-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mycophenolate mofetil</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Deltasone</a>, Kedral, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylprednisolone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Medrol</a>, Orasone, Prelone, Sterapred DS), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine-oral_capsule/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cyclosporine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine_microemulsion-oral_capsule/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Neoral</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tacrolimus/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prograf</a> (a brand of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tacrolimus/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tacrolimus</a>, also known as FK506), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sirolimus_tablets-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Rapamune</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sirolimus_tablets-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sirolimus</a>). You must take these drugs exactly as prescribed for the rest of your life.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_will_i_be_able_to_go_home_after_a_liver_transplant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The average hospital stay after liver transplant is 10 to 14 days. Some patients may be discharged in less time, while others may be in the hospital much longer, depending on complications that may arise. You need to be prepared for both possibilities.</p>.<p>To provide a smooth transition from hospital to home, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nursing</a> staff and your transplant coordinator will begin to prepare you for discharge shortly after you are transferred from the intensive-care unit to the regular nursing floor. You will be given a discharge manual, which reviews much of what you will need to know before you go home.</p>.<p>You will learn how to take your new medications and how to monitor your own <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> and pulse. As you perform these functions regularly, you will become an important participant in your own healthcare. Before your discharge, you will also learn the signs of rejection and infection and will know when it is important to call your doctor.</p>.<p>Readmission after discharge is common, especially within the first year after transplantation. The admission is usually for treatment of a rejection episode or infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_follow-up_is_necessary_after_a_liver_transplant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your first return appointment after a liver transplant will generally be scheduled about one week after discharge 
and regularly scheduled intervals after that. During these visits, you will see the transplant surgeon, 
and/or transplant hepatologist and the transplant coordinator. If needed, a social worker or a member of the psychiatric team may also be available.</p>.<p>All patients return to their transplant hospital approximately five months after the transplant. If a T-tube was inserted during the operation, it will be removed by the transplant surgeon at this time.</p>.<p>All patients are scheduled to return to the hospital at their one-year transplant anniversary date and annually thereafter.</p>.<p>Your primary care doctor should be notified when you receive your transplant and when you are discharged. Though most problems related to the transplant will need to be taken care of at the transplant hospital, your primary care doctor will remain an important part of your medical care.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
