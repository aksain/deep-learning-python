The thyroid gland is responsible for the production of the body's thyroid hormone. The thyroid responds to hormonal signals from the brain to maintain a constant level of thyroid hormone. The hormone signals are sent by specialized areas of the brain (hypothalamus and pituitary), eventually sending thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) that promotes thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_with_thyroid_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Disease of the thyroid gland is extremely common. In some conditions, the thyroid may produce too much hormone. In other conditions, the thyroid may be damaged or destroyed and little, if any, thyroid hormone is produced. The main thyroid hormone is called thyroxine, or T4. </p>.<p>Symptoms vary depending on whether there is too much or too little T4 present in the blood. With an excess of T4 (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperthyroidism</a>), patients complain of feeling restless, emotionally hyper, and hot and sweaty. They may have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>, trouble concentrating, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>. Frequent bowel movements and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> are common. </p>.<p>If T4 levels are low (hypothyroidism) as a result of decreased production by the thyroid gland, patients often 
experienceÂ  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, lethargy, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight gain</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Constipation</a> is common and many patients report feeling excessively <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a>. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hypothyroidism_treated_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In many respects, the treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnant women is 
similar to that in nonpregnant women.. A synthetic form of T4 is given to replace the missing hormone. The 
medication dose is regularly adjusted to maintain a steady blood level of thyroid hormone within the normal range. Therefore, it is routine practice to monitor the blood level of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) during pregnancy. For more information, please read the article on  Hypothyroidism.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_consequences_of_hypothyroidism_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For years, physicians have known of a link between mothers with hypothyroidism during pregnancy and developmental delay in their children after birth. This was particularly seen in mothers who came from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iodine_strong-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">iodine</a> deficient areas of the country (iodine is necessary to produce thyroid hormone and is now a common component of the salt in our foods) and was also observed in mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hashimotos_thyroiditis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hashimoto's thyroiditis</a>.</p>.<p>There is a relationship between thyroid levels in the mother and  brain development of her child. A large study reported in 1999 found that undetected or inadequately treated hypothyroidism in mothers was associated with IQ changes in the infants of these women. The average IQ scores were about 4 points lower in the children of hypothyroid mothers than in children of normal mothers. Larger IQ deficits were seen in the children of mothers who had more severe hypothyroidism. These children had an average IQ 7 points lower than normal. In addition, almost 20% of these children had IQ scores of less than 85 compared to 5% of the children of normal mothers. The children of hypothyroid mothers were also more likely to have difficulty in school or have repeated grades. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>This study demonstrates that uncontrolled hypothyroidism in pregnant women can have long-term effects on the children of these mothers. Also, the effects occur even if the hypothyroidism is mild and the woman does not exhibit any symptoms. However, the more significant the hypothyroidism, the greater the likelihood of developmental problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_early_does_the_mothers_thyroid_hormone_affect_the_unborn_baby" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before birth a baby is entirely dependent on the mother for thyroid hormone until the baby's own thyroid gland can start to function. This usually does not occur until about 12 weeks of gestation (the end of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">first trimester</a> of pregnancy). Thus, hypothyroidism of the mother may play a role early on, before many women realize they are pregnant! In fact, the babies of mothers who were hypothyroid in the first part of pregnancy, then adequately treated, exhibited slower motor development than the babies of normal mothers. However, during the later part of pregnancy, hypothyroidism in the mother can also have adverse effects on the baby, as pointed out by the research described above. These children are more likely to have intellectual impairment.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_to_avoid_the_consequences_of_hypothyroidism_in_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. Some of the recommendations are:</p>.<p>It must be stressed that these are only guidelines. The management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her physician. The benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism, but also to their children.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
