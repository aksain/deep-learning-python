<p><b><a name="gynecomastia_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_gynecomastia_enlarged_male_breasts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gynecomastia is enlargement of the glandular tissue of the male breast. During infancy, puberty, and in middle-aged to older men, gynecomastia can be common. Gynecomastia must be distinguished from pseudogynecomastia or lipomastia, which refers to the presence of fat deposits in the breast area of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obese</a> men. True gynecomastia results from growth of the glandular, or breast tissue, which is present in very small amounts in men. The condition is the most common reason for medical evaluation of the male breast.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_gynecomastia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The primary symptom of gynecomastia is enlargement of the male breasts. As mentioned before, gynecomastia is the enlargement of glandular tissue rather than fatty tissue. It is typically symmetrical in location with regard to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nipple</a> and may have a rubbery or firm feel. Gynecomastia usually occurs on both sides but can be unilateral in some cases. The enlargement may be greater on one side even if both sides are involved. Tenderness and sensitivity may be present, although there is typically no severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>.</p>.<p>The most important distinction with gynecomastia is differentiation from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/male_breast_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">male breast cancer</a>, which accounts for about 1% of overall cases of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast cancer</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cancer</a> is usually confined to one side, is not necessarily centered around the nipple, feels hard or firm, and can be associated with dimpling of the skin, retraction of the nipple, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_discharge/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nipple discharge</a>, and enlargement of the underarm (axillary) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lymph nodes</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_gynecomastia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Normally-developing pubertal males may be at risk for gynecomastia that is part of the normal developmental process. Normal male infants also may have gynecomastia.</p>.<p>Other risk factors include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_gynecomastia_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Illustration of Enlarged Male Breasts (Gynecomastia)<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_gynecomastia_during_puberty_and_how_long_does_it_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gynecomastia results from an imbalance in hormone levels in which levels of estrogen (female hormones) are increased relative to levels of androgens (male hormones). Gynecomastia that occurs in normally-growing infant and pubertal boys that resolves on its own with time is known as physiologic gynecomastia.</p>.<p>All individuals, whether male or female, possess both female hormones (estrogens) and male hormones (androgens). During puberty, levels of these hormones may fluctuate and rise at different levels, resulting in a temporary state in which estrogen concentration is relatively high. Studies regarding the prevalence of gynecomastia in normal adolescents have yielded widely varying results, with prevalence estimates as low as 4% and as high as 69% of adolescent boys. These differences probably result from variations in what is perceived to be normal and the different ages of boys examined in the studies.</p>.<p>Gynecomastia caused by transient changes in hormone levels with growth usually disappears on its own within six months to two years. Occasionally, gynecomastia that develops in puberty persists beyond two years and is referred to as persistent pubertal gynecomastia.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_diseases_and_conditions_cause_gynecomastia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A number of medical conditions may also result in gynecomastia:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_cause_gynecomastia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gynecomastia can also be a side effect of a number of medications. Examples of drugs that can be associated with gynecomastia are listed below:</p>.<p>It is appropriate to consult a doctor or other health care professional if you think you may be developing or have the condition.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_know_if_i_have_gynecomastia_diagnosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The definition of gynecomastia is the presence of breast tissue greater than 0.5 cm in diameter in a male. As previously discussed, gynecomastia is the presence of true breast (glandular) tissue, generally located around the nipple. Fat deposition is not considered to be true gynecomastia.</p>.<p>In most cases, gynecomastia can be diagnosed by a physical examination. A careful medical history is also important, including medication and drug use. If there is a suspicion of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a>, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mammogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">mammogram</a> may be ordered by a health care practitioner. Further tests may be recommended to help establish the cause of gynecomastia in certain cases. These can include blood tests to examine liver, kidney, and thyroid function. Measurement of hormone levels in the bloodstream may also be recommended in some cases.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatment_drugs_and_surgery_procedures_reduce_or_cure_the_condition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gynecomastia, especially in pubertal males, often goes away on its own within about six months, so observation is preferred over specific treatment in many cases. Stopping medications and treatment of existing medical problems or health conditions that cause enlarged breasts in men also are mainstays of treatment.</p>.<p>Medical treatments also are available to specifically address the problem of gynecomastia, but data on their effectiveness are limited, and no drugs have yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of gynecomastia. Medications that have been used to treat gynecomastia include:</p>.<p>Medications are more effective in reducing gynecomastia in the early stages, since scarring often occurs after about 12 months. After the tissue has become scarred, medications are not likely to be effective, and surgical removal is the only possible treatment. Reduction mammoplasty (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_reduction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breast reduction</a> surgery) has been used in severe cases of the condition, long-term gynecomastia, or in cases in which drug therapies have not been effective to help restore a normal breast appearance.</p>.<p>Typically, gynecomastia is not associated with long-term problems.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_it_take_for_gynecomastia_to_go_away" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although pubertal gynecomastia typically regresses on its own, in rare cases it may persist, requiring treatment. Gynecomastia that is present over the long term (12 months or more) may undergo scarring (medically termed fibrosis), making treatment with medications much more difficult if not impossible to achieve a response.</p>.<p>Psychological consequences can occur if the breast enlargement is pronounced or is a source of embarrassment.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_gynecomastia_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gynecomastia that occurs because of hormonal fluctuations with growth or aging cannot be prevented. Gynecomastia related to medical conditions can only be prevented to the extent that the underlying or responsible condition can be prevented.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_gynecomastia_and_male_breast_cancer_related" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Men with gynecomastia have about a five-fold greater risk for developing male <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">breast cancer</a> when compared with the general population.
