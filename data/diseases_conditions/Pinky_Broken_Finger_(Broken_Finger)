<p><b><a name="broken_finger_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="broken_finger_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Fingers are easily injured, and broken fingers are some of the most common traumatic injuries seen in an emergency room. Fractures of the finger bones (phalanxs) and the bones in the palm of the hand (metacarpal bones) are the most common fractures, accounting for 10% of all fractures. Because fingers are used for many everyday activities, they are at higher risk than other parts of the body for traumatic injury, including sports injuries, workplace injuries, and other accidents.</p>.<p>Understanding the basic anatomy of the hand and fingers is useful in understanding different types of finger injuries, broken fingers, and how some treatments differ from others.</p>.<p>The hand is divided into three sections: 1) wrist, 2) palm, and 3) fingers.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_a_broken_finger" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Traumatic injury is the main cause of broken fingers. Most commonly, traumatic injury to the finger occurs from playing sports, workplace injuries, falls, or other accidents. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_a_broken_finger" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The main symptoms of a broken finger are pain immediately after the trauma, and sometimes a deformed finger. </p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_see_a_doctor_for_a_broken_finger" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_broken_finger_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>X-ray is the primary tool used to diagnose a broken finger. The doctor will need an X-ray to evaluate the position of the broken finger bones. </p>.<p>With more complex injuries, the doctor may seek the advice of an orthopedic (bone and joint specialist) or hand surgeon (an orthopedic surgeon or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> surgeon with post-residency, fellowship level training in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_replacement_surgery_of_the_hand/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hand surgery</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_broken_finger" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Broken fingers should be treated by medical professionals; however, a person can minimize some pain and stabilize the injury on the way to seek medical treatment.</p>.<p>The doctor will assess the stability of the broken finger. The treatment for a broken finger depends on the type of fracture, and the particular bone in the finger that is injured.</p>.<p>If the fracture is stable (not likely to worsen or cause complications with the movement of the finger), treatment may be as simple as buddy taping (splinting one finger to another by taping them together) for about four weeks, followed by an additional two weeks of limiting use of the finger.</p>.<p>If the fracture is unstable, the injured finger will need to be immobilized. A splint may be applied after reduction (re-aligning of the fractured fragments). If this does not maintain enough stability, a surgical procedure may be needed.</p>.<p>A surgeon has many different techniques for surgical immobilization, ranging from pinning the fracture with small wires to procedures with plates and screws.</p>.<p>The patient will most likely leave the hospital in some type of immobilizing splint or dressing. Keep the dressing clean, dry, and elevated. It is best not to use the involved hand until a hand specialist is consulted (about one week after the injury) for another X-ray to evaluate the position of the fracture fragments. If the finger is not aligned correctly, it may affect the healing of the finger and leave a permanent disability.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_a_broken_finger" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_a_broken_finger_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best medicine for prevention of finger fractures is safety. Most fingers are broken from machines, self-inflicted trauma (punching something), or sporting injuries. Always use safety equipment when doing activities that may injure the hands. Injuries should be evaluated as soon possible.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
