<p><b><a name="what_is_ciguatera_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ciguatera is a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">food poisoning</a>. 
The ciguatera toxin may be found in large reef fish, most commonly barracuda, 
grouper, red snapper, eel, amberjack, sea bass, and Spanish mackerel. These fish 
live in coral reef waters between latitudes of 35 degrees south to 35 degrees 
north, corresponding to the area located between the Tropic of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cancer</a> and the 
Tropic of Capricorn. These geographic lines ring the earth north and south of 
the equator and make up the tropics. These areas include the Caribbean Sea, 
Hawaii, and coastal Central America.</p>.<p>Ciguatera toxin tends to accumulate in 
predator fish, such as the barracuda and other carnivorous reef fish, because 
they eat other fish that consume toxin-producing algae (dinoflagellates) that 
live in coral reef waters.</p>.<p>Ciguatera toxin is harmless to fish but poisonous 
to humans. The toxin is odorless and tasteless, and it is heat-resistant, so 
cooking does not destroy the toxin. Eating ciguatera-contaminated tropical or 
subtropical fish poisons the person who eats it.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_ciguatera_poisoning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning generally begins six to eight hours after eating
