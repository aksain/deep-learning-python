clot causing the inflammation. Phlebitis can be superficial, in the skin, or 
deep, in the tissues beneath the skin. </p>.<p>Superficial phlebitis is phlebitis that is in a 
superficial vein under the surface of the skin. Deep vein thrombophlebitis 
refers to a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_clot_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clot</a> causing phlebitis in the deeper veins. Deep vein 
thrombophlebitis is also referred to as deep venous thrombophlebitis,

suggest an underlying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_and_pulmonary_embolism/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">DVT</a>. Upper extremity (upper limbs) and lower extremities (lower 
limbs) superficial thrombosis or phlebitis are typically benign conditions and 
have a favorable prognosis. A blood clot (thrombus) in the 
saphenous vein may be 
an exception. This is the large, long vein on the inner side of the legs. 
Thrombophlebitis in the saphenous vein can sometimes be associated with 
underlying deep vein thrombophlebitis.</p>.<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_and_pulmonary_embolism/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">deep vein thrombosis</a> of the upper

(erythema), and bulging of the vein are common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phlebitis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">symptoms of phlebitis</a>. The 
redness and tenderness may follow the course of the vein under the skin. </p>.<p>Low grade <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> may accompany superficial and deep phlebitis. High <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> or 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drainage_of_pus/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drainage of pus</a> from the site of 
thrombophlebitis may suggest an infection of the thrombophlebitis (referred to 
as septic thrombophlebitis).</p>.<p>Palpable cords along the course of the vein may be a sign of a superficial 
clot or superficial thrombophlebitis. </p>.<p>A deep venous thrombosis may present as redness and 
swelling of the involved limb with pain and tenderness. In the leg, this can cause difficulty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_phlebitis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of superficial phlebitis can be made based 
on the physical examination by a physician. Warmth, tenderness, redness, and 
swelling along the course of the vein is highly suggestive of superficial 
phlebitis or thrombophlebitis. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a> of the area can help in making the diagnosis of 
phlebitis or excluding it. </p>.<p>Deep vein thrombosis is more difficult to diagnose on the basis of clinical 
examination. The strongest clinical indicator is unilateral extremity swelling, 
which may be associated with pain, warmth, redness, discoloration or other 
findings. The most commonly used imaging test for diagnosis of deep vein 
thrombosis is ultrasound. It is less expensive than alternatives and highly 
reliable. In many settings, however, it is simply not available 24 hours per 
day.</p>.<p>Other imaging tests of benefit in specific situations include - but are not 
limited to - <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a> scan and venography (phlebography). </p>.<p>D-dimer is a useful 
blood test that can suggest phlebitis. This is a chemical that is released by 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> when they start to degrade. A normal D-dimer makes the diagnosis of 
thrombophlebitis unlikely. The limitation of this test is its lack of 
specificity, meaning that an elevated D-dime level can be seen in other 
conditions including recent surgery, fall, 
pregnancy, or an underlying
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>.</p>.<p>Conditions that mimic phlebitis include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cellulitis</a> 
 (superficial skin 
infection), insect bites, or lymphangitis (swelling and inflammation of lymph 
nodes) and can be distinguished by obtaining a careful medical history and 
physical examination by a physician. Sometimes, a biopsy of the skin may be 
required to establish the definite diagnosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_phlebitis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of phlebitis may depend on the location, extent, symptoms, and 
underlying medical conditions.</p>.<p>In general, superficial phlebitis of the upper and lower extremities can be 
treated by applying warm compresses, elevation of the involved extremity, 
encouraging ambulation (walking), and oral anti-inflammatory medications (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ibuprofen</a> 
[<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Motrin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Advil</a>], <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diclofenac/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diclofenac</a> 
[<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diclofenac/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Voltaren</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diclofenac/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cataflam</a>, Voltaren-XR], etc.). Topical 
anti-inflammatory medications may also be beneficial, such as diclofenac gel. 
External compression with fitted 
stockings is also a recommended for patients with superficial phlebitis of the 
lower extremities. </p>.<p>If an intravenous catheter is the cause, then it should be removed. If the 
phlebitis is infected, then antibiotics are used. In severe cases of infected 
thrombophlebitis, surgical exploration may be necessary.</p>.<p>Superficial thrombophlebitis (blood clots) is evaluated 
by an ultrasound to exclude deep venous thrombophlebitis, especially those 
involving the saphenous vein. If deep venous thrombophlebitis is suspected or 
diagnosed, or if its risk of developing is considerable, then anti-coagulation 
(thinning of blood) may be necessary. This is typically done by injection of low 
molecular weight <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heparin-injection/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heparin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enoxaparin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">enoxaparin</a> 
[<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enoxaparin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lovenox</a>]), or by injection of fondaparinux (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fondaparinux_sodium-injectable/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Arixtra</a>). It can be done by 
treatment with therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin (usually in the 
form of an intravenous drip), followed by oral anti-coagulation with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">warfarin</a> 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Coumadin</a>) for about 3 to 6 months. Newer anticoagulants may replace Coumadin in 
certain circumstances.</p>.<p>Patients with extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may be appropriately 
treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis in selected cases, but will still 
require maintenance anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months.</p>.<p>Selected patients with DVT may require placement of inferior vena cava 
filters to help prevent pulmonary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_and_pulmonary_embolism/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">embolus</a>. In a subset of patients, it may be 
appropriate to remove the filter at a future date. </p>.<p>Recovery of symptoms from superficial phlebitis can last a few weeks. A 
thrombophlebitis may take weeks to months to recover.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_phlebitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications of phlebitis may include local infection and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abscess</a> formation, clot 
formation, and progression to a deep venous thrombosis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_and_pulmonary_embolism/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pulmonary embolism</a>. 
When pronounced deep venous thrombophlebitis has seriously damaged the leg 
veins, this can lead to post-phlebitic syndrome. Post-phlebitic syndrome is 
characterized by chronic swelling of the involved leg and can be associated with 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leg_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">leg pain</a>, discoloration, and ulcers.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_phlebitis_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Simple measures can be taken to prevent phlebitis, although, sometimes it 
cannot be avoided. </p>.<p>Preventive measures of phlebitis include:</p>.<p>Compression stockings are required in many patients after an episode of 
phlebitis, especially deep venous phlebitis. These, and other measures, reduce 
post-phlebitic swelling and the risk of recurrent phlebitis. In most 
hospitalized patients who have limited mobility or have had recent orthopedic 
surgery, a low dose of blood thinners (heparin, fondaparinux, enoxaparin 
[Lovenox] or other agents ) may be injected routinely in order to prevent blood 
clot formation by keeping the blood relatively thin. This preventive dose is 
generally lower than the doses used for treating existing blood clots. A widely 
used alternative is the use of intermittent compression garments on the 
extremities during periods of high risk.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
