A similar type of skin burn can follow overexposure to a tanning bed. UV radiation can also damage the eyes, although no surface burn is apparent.</p>.<p>Sunburn is very common. According to the CDC, in the United States, approximately 50% of adults age 18 to 29 report having at least one sunburn in the preceding year.</p>.<p>UV light is radiation energy in the form of invisible light waves. The sun and tanning beds give off UV light.</p>.<p>The sun discharges three types of ultraviolet radiation, 1) ultraviolet A (UVA), 2) ultraviolet B (UVB), and 3) ultraviolet C (UVC). Only UVA and UVB rays reach earth, and both types are dangerous</p>.<p><b><a name="pictures_of_sunburns_blisters_and_peeling_skin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Following are pictures of various degrees of sunburn.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="can_sunburns_cause_skin_cancer_or_other_skin_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes. Sunburn early in life increases the risk of developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_melanoma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">skin cancer</a> later.

Severe cases of sunburn require emergency medical treatment.</p>.<p>A follow-up visit with a physician is not necessary unless the sunburn was severe.

It colors the skin, imparting a wide variety of skin tones. Melanin blocks some of the UV rays from penetrating the skin. After repeated or prolonged exposure to UV rays, the skin produces more melanin. Consequently, the skin darkens, or tans, which in turn protects the skin to a certain degree.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_to_call_a_doctor_for_a_moderate_or_severe_sunburn" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have symptoms of a severe sunburn call your doctor, or go to an urgent care facility, or emergency department.

One of these agents are free radicals, which is the formation of some potentially harmful molecules in the body. Antioxidants are natural agents that may prevent or reduce the formation of free radicals. Some sun damage is a result of this reaction. Oral or topical antioxidants (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a> A, C, and E, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/green_tea_camellia_sinensis-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">green tea</a>) may theoretically protect the skin against sunburn. Clinical data is not sufficient to support their use instead of or in addition to, traditional sunscreen.</p>.<p><b><a name="home_remedies_for_blisters" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If blisters form after sunburn, do not attempt to burst or "pop" them unless they are located in a very painful area, or are otherwise causing a lot of discomfort due to size. Most blisters will break by themselves if they are left alone. Blisters are better left uncovered as rubbing or placing a tight cover over them may cause infections and more discomfort. If blisters need to be covered because they cause discomfort by rubbing on clothes, use a loosely applied dressing.</p>.<p>Once a sunburn blister breaks, the area of the broken blister should be kept clean by washing it frequently with soap and water. The left over skin should be left alone, but cleaned, until it falls off. Broken blisters generally heal on their own, but topical antibiotic ointments should be applied to the area of broken blisters to prevent infections.</p>.<p>If a sun blister is uncomfortable or too large or located in a cosmetically unappealing area, consider breaking it carefully. This could be done by gently cleaning the area well with soap and water or rubbing alcohol and using a sterilized needle to punch a hole at the edge of the blister gently. The fluid inside can be pushed towards the hole and drained. The area should be cleaned again and covered with a loose dressing afterwards. Topical antibiotics can be applied to the broken blister to reduce the risk of infection.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_are_used_for_the_treatment_of_a_sunburn" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most of the medical treatments for a sunburn are only used to treat symptoms like pain, inflammation, itching, burning, blistering, and peeling.</p>.<p>These medications also relieve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a> or body aches associated with a sunburn.</p>.<p>If you are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> and get a moderate to severe sunburn, contact your doctor to discuss what treatments are safe.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_type_of_skin_type_is_most_susceptible_to_sunburn" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with certain pigment disorders (such as albinism) and those with fair skin are at the highest risk of suffering a mild to severe sunburn. The American Academy of Dermatology classifies skin types into six categories (in terms of susceptibility to sunburn) for skin colors ranging from fair to black. This is called the Fitzpatrick classification.</p>.<p><b>Types 1 and 2: High Susceptibility to Sunburn </b></p>.<p><b>Types 3 and 4: Moderate Susceptibility to Sunburn</b></p>.<p><b>Types 5 and 6: Minimal or No Susceptibility to Sunburn</b></p>.<p>It is often difficult to accurately determine an individual's skin type simply by looking at the color of the skin. It is best to ask the person how quickly they may burn and how easily they tan. The response can determine the person's skin type.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_strengths_of_sunscreens_work_best" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sunscreens protect the skin by absorbing or reflecting the UV radiation, and may be classified into two groups, physical sunscreens, and chemical sunscreens. Many available sunscreens mainly protect against UVB radiation rays, and may not adequately protect against long standing UVA radiation exposure.</p>.<p>The most recommended practice for adequate protection from UV radiation exposure is a combination of physical and chemical sunscreens.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">SPF</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Sun Protection</a> Factor, is the measurement of how well an agent may protect against sunburn. SPF can be calculated from the amount of time it takes to develop mild redness or burning in an unprotected person. For example, if someone develops mild sunburn-related redness in 20 minutes, he or she may develop the same degree of redness in 300 minutes (5 hours) with an SPF 15 sunscreen (15 multiplied by 20 minutes) when properly applied.</p>.<p>Traditionally, the SPF is rated for sun damage by UVB rays only. However, in 2012, the FDA implemented a regulation that required the sunscreen industry to change their labels to include "broad spectrum" information on the protective potential against UVA radiation. This was an important labeling regulation because UVA is responsible for a large portion of sun damage to a person’s skin. These FDA labeling provisions include:</p>.<p>Sunscreen sprays are available, and generally are effective; however, there is a concern about the amount of spray that actually sticks to the skin after it is applied. The spray can be dispersed by wind, an insufficient amount may be sprayed, or the sunscreen may be sprayed too far from the body. It is recommended that sunscreen sprays be used in conjunction with other more traditional topical sunscreens or sunblocks for the best sun protection. Moreover, there are concerns about the amount of sunscreen that may be inhaled unintentionally, and if that poses any health risks.</p>.<p>Sunscreens may degrade over time or after long exposure to sun and heat. The bottle should not be kept in the car or under direct sun exposure for a long period. If the expiration date has passed, the product should be discarded. Sunscreens generally expire or lose their effectiveness after about three years.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="7_tips_to_prevent_a_sunburn_and_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best methods of preventing sunburn, and hopefully skin cancer are to:</p>
