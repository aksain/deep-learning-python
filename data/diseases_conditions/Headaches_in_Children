Many adults with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> started having them as kids -- in fact, 20% of adult <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> sufferers say their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> started before age 10, and 50% report their headaches started before age 20.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_are_headaches_in_children_and_adolescents" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Headaches are very common in children and adolescents. In one study, 56% of boys and 74% of girls between the ages of 12 and 17 reported having had a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> within the past month. By age 15, 5% of all children and adolescents have had migraines and 15% have had tension headaches.</p>.<p>Many parents worry that their child's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headaches_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> is the sign of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_tumor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain tumor</a> or serious medical condition, but most headaches in children and adolescents are not the result of a serious illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_headaches_do_children_and_adolescents_get" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children get the same types of headaches adults do, including: tension headaches, migraines, and sinus headaches.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_headaches_in_children_and_adolescents" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children get headaches for many of the same reasons adults get headaches. But, most headaches in children are usually due to an illness, infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>. Other conditions that can cause headaches include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sinusitis</a> (inflammation of the sinuses), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pharyngitis</a> (inflammation or infection of the throat), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">otitis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ear infection</a>).</p>.<p>The exact causes of migraines are unknown, although they are related to changes in the brain as well as to genetic causes. For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the expanding (dilation) and constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels on the brain's surface. However, it is now believed that migraines are caused by inherited abnormalities in certain areas of the brain.</p>.<p>Most children and adolescents (90%) who have migraines have other family members with migraines. When both parents have a history of migraines, there is a 70% chance that the child will also develop migraines. If only one parent has a history of migraines, the risk drops to 25%-50%. Children and adolescents with migraines may also inherit the tendency to be affected by certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache_and_migraine_triggers_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">migraine triggers</a>, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, bright lights, and changes in weather.</p>.<p>Some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">migraine</a> triggers can be identified such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, a change in routine or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> pattern, bright light, loud noises, or certain foods, food additives, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">beverages</a>.

The headaches may disappear and then return later in life. By junior high school, many boys who have migraines outgrow them, but in girls, migraine frequency increases with age because of hormone changes. Migraines are three times more likely to occur in adolescent girls than in boys.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
