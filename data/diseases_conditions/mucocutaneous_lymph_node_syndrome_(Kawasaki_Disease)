The terminology "incomplete Kawasaki disease" is sometimes used for patients who are diagnosed with only some features of classical Kawasaki disease. Most patients are under 5 years of age with a peak incidence at 18 months of age. It is the most common acquired <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a> in children.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_mucocutaneous_lymph_node_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is the original name for Kawasaki disease. The original name was quite descriptive because the disease is characterized by the typical changes in the mucous membranes that line the lips and mouth and by the enlarged and tender <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lymph nodes</a>. Kawasaki disease is also termed infantile polyarteritis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_of_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause is not known. Microorganisms and toxins have been suspected, but none has been identified to date. It is common for Kawasaki disease to occur after a preceding infection, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adenoids_and_tonsils/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tonsillitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ear infection</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>, urine infection, or gastrointestinal infection. Genetic factors (genetic variants in some patients) and the immune system seem to play roles in the disease, which is characterized by immune activation. The disease is more common in those of Japanese or Korean descent.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_develops_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Kawasaki disease typically affects children under 5 years of age. Only rarely does it affect children over 8 years of age, in which case it is sometimes referred to as atypical Kawasaki disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_usual_symptoms_and_signs_of_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The usual symptoms and signs of Kawasaki disease include</p>.<p>The rash appears in a glove-and-sock fashion over the skin of the hands and feet. The rash becomes hard, swollen (edematous), and then peels off.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_unusual_signs_and_symptoms_of_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most of the common symptoms described above will resolve without complications, even if untreated. Less common findings include inflammation of the lining of the heart (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pericarditis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pericarditis</a>), joints (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a>), or covering of the brain and spinal cord (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meningitis</a>), and the other heart problems listed below in the section on serious complications. The outlook (prognosis) for an individual affected is primarily determined by the seriousness of any heart complications.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_difference_between_kawasaki_disease_and_kawasaki_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>They are the same. Kawasaki disease is also referred to as Kawasaki syndrome. It was first described in the late 1960s in Japan by the renowned pediatrician Tomisaku Kawasaki.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_kawasaki_disease_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No. Kawasaki disease is not believed to be a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_kawasaki_disease_cause_serious_complications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children with Kawasaki disease can develop inflammation of the arteries of various parts of the body. This inflammation of the arteries is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vasculitis</a>. Arteries that can be affected include the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (the coronary arteries). Vasculitis can cause weakening of the blood vessels and lead to areas of vessel widening (aneurysms). The weakening occurs because of destruction of the elastic tissue in the walls of the blood vessels. Coronary artery aneurysms occur because of such injury to the blood vessels in Kawasaki disease.</p>.<p>Because of the potential for heart injury and coronary artery aneurysms, special tests are performed to examine the heart. Children are typically evaluated with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrocardiogram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EKG</a>) and an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> test of the heart (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">echocardiogram</a>). Monitoring for this problem is crucial throughout life as it can develop as a late aftereffect of Kawasaki disease. Other arteries that can become inflamed include the arteries of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, neck, and abdomen. These effects can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, respectively. Blood tests to measure the degree of inflammation (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/c-reactive_protein_test_crp/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">C-reactive protein</a>, or CRP, and erythrocyte <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sedimentation rate</a>, or ESR) are often used to monitor the activity of the disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children affected by Kawasaki disease are hospitalized. Kawasaki disease is treated with high doses of aspirin (salicylic acid) to reduce inflammation and to mildly thin the blood to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> formation. Also used in treatment is gamma globulin administered through the vein (intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIG), together with fluids. This treatment has been shown to decrease the chance of developing coronary aneurysms in the coronary arteries, especially when used early in the illness. Sometimes cortisone medications are given. Persisting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">joint pains</a> are treated with anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">naproxen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aleve</a>).</p>.<p>Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) has been reported as effective in patients who were not responding to aspirin and gamma globulin. Plasmapheresis is a procedure whereby the patient's plasma is removed from the blood and replaced with protein-containing fluids. By taking out portions of the patient's plasma, the procedure also removes antibodies and proteins that are felt to be part of the immune reaction that is causing the inflammation of the disease.</p>.<p>Kawasaki disease that is not responding to the traditional cornerstones of treatment, aspirin and gamma globulin infusions, can be deadly. Treatments being investigated include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxycycline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">doxycycline</a>, statin drugs (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atorvastatin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lipitor</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lovastatin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Mevacor</a>, others), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anakinra/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">anakinra</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anakinra/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Kineret</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine-oral_capsule/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">cyclosporine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyclosporine_microemulsion-oral_capsule/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Neoral</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_children_with_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Kawasaki disease is typically self-limited and generally resolves on its own after four to eight weeks, and with early treatment, full recovery is usual.</p>.<p>However, the outcome is not so favorable in every child. Rarely, Kawasaki disease can cause death from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> forming in abnormal areas of widening (aneurysms) of the heart arteries (coronary arteries) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/myocarditis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myocarditis</a> (inflammation of heart muscle). Aneurysms of the arteries to the heart (coronary arteries) can occur early or late, even when the children are adults so follow-up is recommended for those patients diagnosed with the disease. Those children with larger aneurysms have a worse prognosis because of this risk. Such aneurysms can lead to blood clots, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myocardial infarction</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/internal_bleeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">internal bleeding</a>. Those whose echocardiograms do not demonstrate widening of the coronary arteries throughout life do best. Those with any signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_aneurysm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">aneurysm</a> changes require very close monitoring. Children less than 6 months of age and those with high levels of inflammation on blood testing are at highest risk.</p>.<p>The earlier the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun the better the outcome.</p>.<p>Researchers are searching for methods of detecting which children are at risk for the development of aneurysms of the coronary arteries. Further research is under way to investigate a variety of criteria for atypical variants of Kawasaki disease that do not have classical presentations.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_kawasaki_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because the cause of Kawasaki disease has not been determined, there are no measures known that can prevent the disease. Early evaluation and treatment can decrease the chance for long-term problems and/or complications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
