<p>Gastritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach. Unfortunately, the term "gastritis" has been misused to include many different upper abdominal problems, but true gastritis refers to the stomach lining (gastric mucosa) that is inflamed. All or part of the gastric mucosa may be involved. Gastritis may be classified as acute or chronic.</p>.<p>This article will focus on true gastritis. Gastritis has many causes, but most causes result in similar symptoms. This has leads to some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">confusion</a> and is the reason why many health-care professionals now consider the term "gastritis" as a non-specific description of a cluster of symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Many people with gastritis do not have symptoms. The condition is diagnosed only when samples of the stomach mucosa are examined for other suspected diseases. However, when gastritis symptoms occur, the most common symptoms include the following:</p>.<p>These last four symptoms come and go over time especially with chronic gastritis. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Indigestion</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dyspepsia</a>) is another term that encompasses this cluster of symptoms.</p>.<p>Symptoms of severe gastritis may include:</p>.<p>Acute gastritis lasts for about 2-10 days.</p>.<p>Chronic gastritis, if untreated, may last from weeks to years. If the underlying cause of gastritis (for example, alcohol drinking) is untreated, then the gastritis it causes will likely continue.</p>.<p></p>.<p>There are general recommendations about what foods and drinks that you should consume to help reduce and relieveÂ <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastritis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of gastritis</a>. If underlying causes are not treated (for example, severe <em>H. pylori</em> infection, eating spicy foods and/or alcohol consumption), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a> changes may result in little or no change in gastritis symptoms.</p>.<p>Foods and other substances that should be avoided to reduce or prevent gastritis symptoms include:</p>.<p>Moreover, anything that might be toxic or irritating to the stomach should also be avoided (for example <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/quit_smoking_tips_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cigarette smoking</a>, acidic drinks like coffee, garlic powder, chili powder, peppers and tomato products).</p>.<p></p>.<p>The University of Maryland health-care professionals and others suggest that eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding foods that are spicy, acidic, fried or fatty will help reduce symptoms. Moreover, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> reduction is also recommended. Dietary changes such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ginger_zingiber_officinale-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ginger</a> tea and/or chamomile tea with honey reportedly soothes gastritis symptoms while onions, garlic, cranberries, apples, and celery may stop H. pylori growth.</p>.<p>Foods that may stop H. pylori growth and relieve gastritis symptoms include:</p>.<p>A major cause of both acute and chronic gastritis is infection of the stomach mucosa by a bacterial species named <i> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/helicobacter_pylori_h_pylori_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Helicobacter pylori</a></i>. Usually, this bacterium first infects the stomach antrum (stomach mucosa without acid-producing cells) acutely and may progress to infect most or all of the stomach's mucosa over time (chronic gastritis) and remain there for years. This infection generates an initial strong inflammatory response and eventually, a long-term chronic inflammation with intestinal cell changes may develop. Another major cause of acute and chronic gastritis is the use (and overuse) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p>.<p>However, there are many other causes of gastritis; the following is a list of common causes of both acute and chronic gastritis; chronic gastritis may occur with repeated or continual presence of most of these causes:</p>.<p>In general, infectious agents, especially <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, and NSAIDs are responsible for the majority of people with gastritis.</p>.<p>Gastritis is diagnosed based on the patient's symptoms and history of a previous diagnosis and treatment of gastritis, alcohol consumption, and use of NSAIDs. Definitive diagnosis of gastritis is made by identifying the underlying cause of the gastric mucosal inflammation and/or by tissue (gastric) biopsy. For example, the major infective cause of gastritis is<i> Helicobacter pylori</i> <i>(H. pylori)</i>. This bacterium can be detected by breath, blood, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a>, immunological and biopsy tests. Although the bacterium can be cultured from the patient, this is seldom attempted. Other pathogens can be identified using culture, stool, and immunological tests.</p>.<p>Biopsy of the stomach mucosa, done during endoscopy examinations, is often used in patients to identify the causes of chronic gastritis and may allow visualization of mucosal erosions and other stomach mucosal changes. Abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> or barium studies (upper or lower) may demonstrate the presence of thickened mucosa and folds that are signs of inflammation in the stomach.</p>.<p>Your doctor can help determine which tests should be done, including ancillary tests that may help identify other causes of the non-specific symptoms commonly found with gastritis.</p>.<p>Treatments for gastritis vary and depend on successful treatments of its underlying cause(s). The most common treatments are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) and prescription medications for symptom relief.</p>.<p>A diet that avoids hot, fried and/or spicy foods, alcohol drinking, or eating items you may be allergic to is another good way to both treat and reduce the risk of gastritis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Some people consider OTC medications as home remedies to help reduce symptoms of gastritis, for example, over-the-counter antacids (Rolaids, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aluminum_hydroxide_magnesium_hydroxide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Maalox</a>) or histamine blockers (Pepsid, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ranitidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zantac</a>). However, home remedies usually do not treat the underlying cause of the condition.</p>.<p>Treating the underlying cause of gastritis is the most effective way to reduce or resolve gastritis symptoms. For example, if the cause of gastritis is <i>H. pylori</i>, then treatment with appropriate antibiotics (usually a combination of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amoxicillin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">amoxicillin</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clarithromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">clarithromycin</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clarithromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Biaxin</a>, Biaxin XL] plus bismuth subsalicylate [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bismuth_subsalicylate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pepto-Bismol</a>]) should be effective to provide relief from symptoms.</p>.<p>If NSAIDs are the cause, then stopping the drug should be effective.</p>.<p>Other treatments often are used in addition to those that treat the specific cause of gastritis, many of which are over-the-counter or OTC, may reduce or stop symptoms of gastritis and allow gastric mucosal healing to begin regardless of the underlying cause. These medications include</p>.<p>They all function by different mechanisms to reduce acid in the stomach but usually do not treat the underlying cause of gastritis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The complications of gastritis may occur over time, especially if gastritis becomes chronic and the underlying causes are not treated. Complications of gastritis may include</p>.<p>Most people that get gastritis have few or short-term symptoms and recover completely (cured). Those people with underlying causes that are appropriately treated often recover completely. The prognosis of individuals with chronic disease and those who develop serious complications like bleeding ulcers, obstruction and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> is more guarded.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>If the underlying cause of gastritis is preventable, then gastritis can be prevented and people can get gastritis relief.</p>
