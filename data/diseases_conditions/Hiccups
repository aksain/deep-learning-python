<p>Hiccups (also spelled hiccough) are sudden, involuntary contractions (spasms) of the diaphragm muscle. When the muscle spasms, the vocal cords snap shut, producing the hiccup sound.</p>.<p>Hiccups are often rhythmic. They are usually just a temporary minor annoyance, but prolonged hiccups may signal a major medical problem. The longest recorded hiccup attack is six decades!</p>.<p>Women and men tend to get hiccups equally as often, but hiccups that last more than 48 hours are more common in men. Hiccups can even occur in a fetus while still in utero.</p>.<p>The medical term for hiccups is singultus, which comes from the Latin word for “gasp” or “sob.”<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Most of the time, there is no obvious cause for hiccups. However, there are some common known causes of hiccups.</p>.<p>Some causes of hiccups include:</p>.<p>Some medications may also have hiccups as a side effect, for example:</p>.<p>As in adults, hiccups in newborns, infants, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a> are common and generally of no concern. If hiccups occur during feeding, stop feeding until the hiccups go away. Usually the hiccups will "go away" in an infant or baby. You may try changing the position of the infant or baby; try to get your baby to burp; or calming him/her down to cure the hiccups. Sometimes resuming feeding will stop the hiccups. If your baby frequently hiccups during feedings, feed your baby when he or she is already relaxed, and is not overly hungry yet.</p>.<p>If your child's hiccups worsen or they seem to upset him, contact your pediatrician.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Sudden, forceful movement of the diaphragm, that causes the hiccup sound, is the only symptom of hiccups.</p>.<p>Most cases of hiccups resolve themselves in a short time, and rarely are a medical emergency. See your doctor if hiccups last more than three hours, or if they disturb your eating or sleeping habits.</p>.<p>Seek medical attention if hiccups are associated with: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shortness of breath</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bloody_sputum/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">coughing up blood</a>, or feeling as if your throat is going to close up.</p>.<p>Most of us know what a hiccup feels like and how to recognize it. In a medical setting, the diagnosis of hiccups is based on physical evaluation. Blood tests or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> are usually not necessary unless your hiccups are a symptom of an associated medical condition.</p>.<p>Hiccups generally go away on their own and do not require medical treatment, however, if hiccups last more than three hours or disturb eating or sleeping, you may see your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internist, or a child’s pediatrician.<br>There may be many different specialists who treat hiccups depending on the underlying cause, for example:</p>.<p>There are numerous home cures for hiccups. You can try these methods at home to get rid of hiccups:</p>.<p>Methods that cause the body to retain carbon dioxide, which is thought to relax the diaphragm and stop the spasms, which cause the hiccups:</p>.<p>Techniques that stimulate the nasopharynx and the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the stomach, and can decrease hiccuping:</p>.<p>Most hiccups will stop on their own. Home remedies are generally sufficient to resolve hiccuping.</p>.<p>For persistent hiccups (lasting more than three hours), treatment varies, and you may need to contact your doctor.</p>.<p>A health-care professional may prescribe medications for severe, chronic hiccups. Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) is usually the first-line medication prescribed for hiccups. Other medications used to treat hiccups include haloperidol (Haldol) and metoclopramide (Reglan).</p>.<p>Some muscle relaxants, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypnotics_drug_class_side_effects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sedatives</a>, analgesics, and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a> have also been reported to help alleviate hiccup symptoms.</p>.<p>Phrenic nerve surgery (the nerve that controls the diaphragm) is a treatment of last resort. This treatment rarely is performed and is used only in individuals with hiccups that do not respond to other treatments.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Because most cases of hiccups resolve themselves either spontaneously or with self-administered treatment, complications are extremely rare.</p>.<p>In severe and persistent cases, where hiccups disturb eating and sleeping patterns, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> disturbances may occur.</p>.<p>Rarely, cardiac arrhythmias and gastroesophageal reflux (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">GERD</a> and GER) have been noted in severe cases of hiccups.</p>.<p>Hiccups cannot always be prevented. Avoiding overeating, eating too quickly, or drinking too much can help prevent hiccups.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
