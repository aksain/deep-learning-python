</p>.<p><b><a name="care" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No. Simply follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, floss at least once a day and see your dentist for regular professional check-ups and cleanings.</p>.<p>Because bonding material can chip, it is important to avoid such habits as biting fingernails; chewing on pens, ice or other hard food objects; or using your bonded teeth as an opener. If you do notice any sharp edges on a bonded tooth or if your tooth feels odd when you bite down, call your dentist.</p>.<p><b><a name="last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The lifespan of bonding materials depends on how much bonding was done and your oral habits. Typically, however, bonding material lasts from 3 years up to about 10 years before needing to be touched up or replaced.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="cost" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Costs may vary depending on where you live. Generally, bonding can range in cost from $100 to $400 per tooth. Check with your dental insurance company to find out if the cost of crowns might be fully or partially covered.</p>.<p><font size="1" face="arial">Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.<br>Edited by  Michael W.
