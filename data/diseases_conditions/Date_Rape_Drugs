Sexual assault is any type of sexual activity that a person does not agree to. It can include touching that is not okay; putting something into the vagina; rape; and attempted rape.</p>.<p>Date rape drugs are powerful and dangerous. They can be slipped into your drink when you are not looking. The drugs often have no color, smell, or taste, so you can't tell if you are being drugged. The drugs can make you become weak and confused -- or even pass out -- so that you cannot consent to sex. If you are drugged, you might not remember what happened while you were drugged. Date rape drugs may be used on both females and males.</p>.<p>These drugs also are known as "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/club_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">club drugs</a>" because they tend to be used at dance clubs, concerts, and "raves."</p>.<p>The term "date rape" is widely used. But most experts prefer the term "drug-facilitated sexual assault." These drugs also are used to help people commit other crimes, like robbery and physical assault. They are used on both men and women. The term "date rape" also can be misleading because the person who commits the crime might not be dating the victim. Rather, it could be an acquaintance or stranger.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_most_common_date_rape_drugs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The three most common date rape drugs are:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_the_drugs_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_effects_do_these_drugs_have_on_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These drugs are very powerful. They can affect you very quickly and without your knowing. The length of time that the effects last varies. It depends on how much of the drug is taken and if the drug is mixed with other drugs or alcohol. Alcohol makes the drugs even stronger and can cause serious health problems -- even death.</p>.<p>The effects of Rohypnol can be felt within 30 minutes of being drugged and can last for several hours. If you are drugged, you might look and act like someone who is drunk. You might have trouble standing. Your speech might be slurred. Or you might pass out. Rohypnol can cause these problems:</p>.<p>GHB takes effect in about 15 minutes and can last 3 or 4 hours. It is very potent: A very small amount can have a big effect.

Also, a person who willingly takes ecstasy is at greater risk of sexual assault. Ecstasy can make a person feel "lovey-dovey" towards others. It also can lower a person's ability to give reasoned consent. Once under the drug's influence, a person is less able to sense danger or to resist a sexual assault.</p>.<p>Even if a victim of sexual assault drank alcohol or willingly took drugs, the victim is <b>not</b> at fault for being assaulted. It is never OK to have sexual contact with someone without their consent. Sexual assault is always the responsibility of the person who commits the assault. Sexual assault is never the victim's fault, regardless of the circumstances.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_protect_myself_from_being_a_victim" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_ways_to_tell_if_i_might_have_been_drugged_and_raped" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is often hard to tell. Most victims don't remember being drugged or assaulted. The victim might not be aware of the attack until 8 or 12 hours after it occurred. These drugs also leave the body very quickly.
