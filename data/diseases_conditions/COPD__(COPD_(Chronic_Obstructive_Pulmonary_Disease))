The incidence of COPD has almost doubled since 1982. Experts have estimated about 32 million persons in the United States have COPD. The disease occurs slightly more often in men than in women. The symptoms (for example, shortness of breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a>) come on slowly and many people are consequently diagnosed after age 40-50, although some are diagnosed at a younger age. COPD patients may exhibit symptoms of chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bronchitis</a>, emphysema, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">asthma</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a slowly progressive disease so it is not unusual for the initial signs and symptoms to be a bit different from those in the late stages of the disease. There are many ways to evaluate or stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, often based on symptoms.</p>.<p>Usually the first signs and symptoms of COPD include a productive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cough</a> usually in the morning, with colorless or white mucus (sputum).</p>.<p>The most significant symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is breathlessness, termed shortness of breath (dyspnea). Early on, this symptom may occur occasionally with exertion, and eventually may progress to breathlessness while doing a simple task such as standing up, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">walking</a> to the bathroom. Some people may develop wheezing (a whistling or hissing sound while breathing). Signs and symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include:</p>.<p>As the disease progresses from mild to moderate, symptoms often increase in severity:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_four_stages_of_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>One way to stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease program (GOLD). The staging is based on the results of a pulmonary function test. Specifically, the forced expiratory volume (how much air one can exhale forcibly) in one second (FEV1) of a standard predicted value is measured, based on the individual patient's physical parameters. The staging of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by this method is as follows:</p>.<p>Other staging methods are similar but are based on the severity of the shortness of breath symptom that is sometimes subjective. The above staging is measurable objectively, providing the patient is putting forth their best effort.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cigarette smoking</a> or exposure to tobacco smoke. It is estimated that 90% of the risk for development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is related to tobacco smoke. The smoke also can be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/secondhand_smoke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">secondhand smoke</a> (tobacco smoke exhaled by a smoker and then breathed in by a non-smoker).</p>.<p>Other causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are:</p>.<p>Damage to the lung tissue over time causes physical changes in the tissues of the lungs and clogging of the airways with thick mucus. The tissue damage in the lungs leads to poor compliance (the elasticity, or ability of the lung tissue to expand). The decrease in elasticity of the lungs means that oxygen in the air cannot get by obstructions (for example, thick mucus plugs) to reach air spaces (alveoli) where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the lung. Consequently, the person exhibits a progressive difficulty, first coughing to remove obstructions like mucus, and then in breathing, especially with exertion.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_developing_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who smoke tobacco are at the highest risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke from tobacco and exposure to high levels of air pollution, especially air pollution associated with wood or coal. In addition, individuals with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">airway</a> hyper-responsiveness such as those with chronic asthma are at increased risk.</p>.<p>There is a genetic factor called alpha-1 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alpha_1_antitrypsin_deficiency/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">antitrypsin</a> deficiency that places a small percentage (less than 1%) of people at higher risk for COPD (and emphysema) because a protective factor (alpha-1 antitrypsin protein) for lung tissue elasticity is decreased or absent.</p>.<p>Other factors that may increase the risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include</p>.<p>In general, three other non-genetic problems related to the lung tissue play a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 1) chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">bronchitis</a>, 2) emphysema, and 3) infectious diseases of the lung.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnosis_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The preliminary diagnosis of COPD is diagnosed in a person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms</a> by</p>.<p>Other tests to diagnose COPD include:</p>.<p>In addition, the person may be sent to a lung specialist (pulmonologist) to determine their FEV1 level that is used by some physicians to stage COPD as described above in the section that describes the stages of COPD.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The first and best is to stop smoking immediately.</p>.<p>Medical treatments of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nicotine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nicotine</a> replacement therapy, beta-2 agonists and anticholinergic agents (bronchodilators), combined drugs using steroids and long-acting bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, oxygen therapy, and surgical procedures such as bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation.</p>.<p>The treatments are often based on the stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for example:</p>.<p>The three major goals of the comprehensive treatment and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications_treat_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first line of therapy that involves medication is related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking cessation</a> with nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine replacement therapy can help patients <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">quit smoking</a> tobacco because it can help reduce the withdrawal symptoms due to nicotine. Replacement therapies include nicotine-containing chewing gum and patches that allow nicotine to be absorbed through the skin. In these types of therapy, nicotine is gradually reduced. This medication can work well for those patients who are seriously attempting to quit tobacco.</p>.<p>Bronchodilators are used for COPD treatment because they open up the airway tubes and allow air to more freely pass in and out of the lung tissue. There are both short-term (several hours) and long-term (12 or more hours) types of bronchodilators.</p>.<p>Examples of short-term bronchodilators</p>.<p>Examples of long-term bronchodilators</p>.<p>Anticholinergicbronchodilators</p>.<p>Other bronchodilators such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/theophylline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">theophylline</a> (Elixophyllin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/theophylline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Theo-24</a>) are occasionally used, but are not favored because of unwanted side effects including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tremors</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizures</a>, and arrhythmias.</p>.<p>Also on the market are combined to drugs using steroids and long-acting bronchodilators.

Home remedies for COPD include:</p>.<p>Other supplementary therapies such as treatment with antibiotics to reduce pathogen (viral, fungal, bacterial) damage to lung tissue, mucolytic agents to help unblock mucus-clogged airways, or oxygenation therapies to increase the available oxygen to lung tissues may also reduce the symptoms of COPD.</p>.<p>In some people, oxygen therapy will increase his/her life expectancy, and improve the quality of life. This is especially true with people with COPD who have chronically low oxygen levels in the blood. It may also help <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> endurance. Oxygen delivery systems are now easily portable and have reduced in cost in comparison to earlier designs.</p>.<p>Yoga may be another form of beneficial exercise that helps with breathing efficiency and breathing muscle control.</p>.<p>The person with COPD should discuss the use of any home remedies or supplements with their physician before beginning such treatments because some treatments may interfere with ongoing therapy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_to_call_your_doctor_for_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A person should see their doctor if they experience any of the signs and symptoms of COPD and are members of a high-risk group for developing COPD, such as people who smoke.</p>.<p>In general, patients who notice an increasing shortness of breath that wasn't present recently, especially with any minor exertion should make an appointment to see their doctor. People already diagnosed with COPD who notice an increase in symptoms or have emphysema or chronic bronchitis that worsen should also see their doctor quickly.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_copd_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Except for COPD due to genetic problems, this health condition can be prevented in many people by simply never using tobacco products.</p>.<p>Other preventive measures include</p>.<p><b><a name="which_types_of_doctors_treat_copd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
