<p><b><a name="what_is_an_endometrial_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The uterus (womb) is lined by a special type of tissue known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">endometrium</a>. Endometrial biopsy, or endometrial sampling, is a technique of removing a piece of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The sample of tissue is analyzed under a microscope in the laboratory by a pathologist, a doctor with special training in diagnosis of diseases based upon tissue examination.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_endometrial_biopsy_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An endometrial biopsy is most often performed to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help evaluate the cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a>, test for uterine infections, and even monitor the response to certain medications.</p>.<p>Endometrial biopsy has many advantages over the more complicated procedure known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dilation_and_curettage/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dilation and curettage</a> (D&amp;C), which is a more extensive removal of the uterine lining that requires dilation (stretching) of the cervical opening with special instruments. Unlike D&amp;C, endometrial biopsy may be performed in the doctor's office and typically does not require anesthesia or hospitalization.</p>.<p>Endometrial biopsy cannot be performed during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>, and sometimes may not be recommended when certain other conditions are present, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer of the cervix</a> or abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_an_endometrial_biopsy_performed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Endometrial biopsy is most often done in the physician's office, but it can be performed on women in the hospital. The patient lies on the examining table in a position similar to that used for obtaining Pap smears. The doctor uses a speculum to open the vaginal canal and visualize the cervix, the opening to the uterus. During endometrial biopsy the doctor inserts a thin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> or metal tubular device through the cervix into the uterus to remove a tiny piece of the inner lining tissue. </p>.<p>Usually no anesthesia is required, but taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure can help reduce cramping and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>. In some cases, a small amount of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lidocaine</a> anesthetic is inserted into the uterine cavity to minimize discomfort.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_of_endometrial_biopsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are very few risks with endometrial biopsy. The leading risk is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or cramping, but this typically subsides rapidly following the procedure. Other less common risks are feeling faint or light-headed, possible infection, bleeding, and rarely, perforation of the uterus.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
