<p><b><a name="keloid_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_keloid_scar" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Keloids can be considered to be "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scars</a> that don't know when to stop." A keloid, sometimes referred to as a keloid scar, is a tough heaped-up scar that rises quite abruptly above the rest of the skin. It usually has a smooth top and a pink or purple color. Keloids are irregularly shaped and tend to enlarge progressively. Unlike scars, keloids do not regress over time.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_cause_of_keloids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors do not understand exactly why keloids form. Alterations in the cellular signals that control proliferation and inflammation may be related to the process of keloid formation, but these changes have not yet been characterized sufficiently to explain this defect in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">wound</a> healing.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_keloid_risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Individuals with darkly pigmented skin are 15 times more likely to develop keloids, with those of African, Hispanic, and Asian ethnicity are at greatest risk. Keloids are equally common in women and men. Keloids are less common in children and the elderly. Although people with darker skin are more likely to develop them, keloids can occur in people of all skin types. In some cases, the tendency to form keloids seems to run in families. Studies have not as yet delineated the exact genes responsible for this predisposition.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="in_which_area_of_the_body_are_keloids_most_likely_to_appear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Keloids develop most often on the chest, back, shoulders, and earlobes. They seldom develop on the face (with the exception of the jawline).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_difference_between_a_keloid_hypertrophic_scar_and_a_%0Adermatofibroma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After the skin is injured, the healing process usually leaves a flat scar. Sometimes the scar is hypertrophic, or thickened, but confined to the margin of the original wound. Hypertrophic scars tend to be redder and often regress spontaneously (a process which can take one year or more). Treatment, such as injections of cortisone (steroids), can speed this process.</p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/dermatofibroma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">dermatofibroma</a> is a small, benign, pigmented, very firm bump in the skin that does not cause other symptoms. It is most often found on the legs. Dermatofibromas are almost never larger than ½ to ¾ of an inch and remain unchanged over many years.</p>.<p>Keloids, by contrast, may start sometime after a cutaneous injury and extend beyond the wound site. This tendency to migrate into surrounding areas that weren't injured originally distinguishes keloids from hypertrophic scars. Keloids typically appear following surgery or injury, but they can also as a result of some minor inflammation, such as an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acne</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adult_acne_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pimple</a> on the chest (even one that wasn't scratched or otherwise irritated). Other minor injuries that can trigger keloids are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a> and cosmetic piercings.</p>.<p>A keloid has a characteristic microscopic appearance and may be distinguished from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hypertrophic_scar_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">hypertrophic scar</a> and a dermatofibroma.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="keloids_and_piercing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Keloids can develop following the minor injuries that occur with body piercing. Since this form of physical adornment has become popular, the presence of keloidal scarring is much more prevalent. Since doctors do not understand the precise reasons why some people are more prone to developing keloids, it is impossible to predict whether one's first piercing will lead to keloid formation. Although there are some families that seem prone to forming keloids, for the most part, it's impossible to tell who will develop a keloid. One person might, for instance, develop a keloid in one earlobe after piercing and not in the other. It makes sense, however, for someone who has formed one keloid to avoid any elective surgery or cosmetic piercing of any body part.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_remove_a_keloid" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The decision about when to treat a keloid depends on the symptoms associated with its development and its anatomical location. A chronically <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itchy</a> and irritated keloid can be quite distracting. Keloids in cosmetically sensitive areas that cause disfigurement or embarrassment are obvious candidates for treatment. It is unclear whether early treatment is important. What is clear is that larger keloids are more difficult to treat.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_keloid_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Keloids are raised and look shiny and dome-shaped, ranging in color from pink to red. Some keloids become quite large and unsightly. Aside from causing potential cosmetic problems, these exuberant scars tend to be itchy, tender, or even painful to the touch.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_diagnose_and_treat_keloids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and certain family physicians generally diagnose and treat keloids with occasional help from therapeutic radiologists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_home_remedies_for_keloids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no effective home remedies for keloids.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatment_options_for_keloids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The methods now available to treat keloids are as follows:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_keloid_prevention_possible" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best way to deal with a keloid is not to get one. A person who has had a keloid should not undergo elective or cosmetic skin surgeries or procedures such as piercing. When it comes to keloids, prevention is crucial, because current treatments leave a lot to be desired.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_keloids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Small keloids can be effectively treated using a variety of methods. Generally, a series of injections of steroids into the problem area is the simplest and safest approach. The patient needs to understand that the keloid will never entirely disappear but is likely to become less symptomatic and flatter. Larger lesions are more difficult to treat.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
