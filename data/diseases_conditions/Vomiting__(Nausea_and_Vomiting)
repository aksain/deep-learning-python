Nausea is the sensation that the stomach wants to empty itself, while vomiting (emesis) or throwing up, is the act of forcible emptying of the stomach. The term "dry heaves" (retching) refers to an episode of vomiting where there is no food in the stomach to vomit, and only small amounts of clear secretions are vomited.</p>.<p>Vomiting is a violent act in which the stomach, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a>, stomach, and small intestine forcibly expel contents of the stomach (and sometimes the small intestine) in a coordinated fashion.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_nausea_and_vomiting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many causes of nausea and vomiting, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="gastrointestinal_gi_digestive_causes_of_anusea_and_vomiting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Acute gastritis or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esophagitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">esophagitis</a> often caused by something that irritates the lining of the stomach or throat, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="during_pregnancy_morning_sickness_cuases_of_nausea_and_vomiting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vomiting in pregnancy is caused by hormone level changes in the bloodstream. Most women have moderate symptoms of morning sickness, especially during the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">first trimester</a>. The symptoms of morning sickness during pregnancy usually resolve by the fourth month. Rarely, a woman may experience severe vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss, which is referred to as hyperemesis gravidarum.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="neurological_causes_of_nausea_and_vomiting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="diabetes_diseases_and_eating_disorders" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p style="margin-left: 40px;">People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a> can also develop nausea and vomiting should their blood sugars become abnormally high or low (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperglycemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hyperglycemia</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypoglycemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypoglycemia</a>) because the sugar and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">insulin</a> balance is disturbed.</p>.<p><b><a name="nausea_and_vomitnig_caused_by_drug_side_effects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="vomiting_in_infants" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It may be hard to decide if an infant is vomiting or spitting up.

Concentrated, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dark_urine/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dark urine</a> is associated with dehydration because the kidneys try to preserve as much water as possible in the body.

Ideally, these symptoms should resolve when the underlying illness is treated and controlled.</p>.<p>Nausea and vomiting are often made worse when you are dehydrated, resulting in a vicious cycle. Nausea makes it difficult to drink fluid, making the dehydration worse, which then increases nausea. Intravenous fluids may be provided to correct this issue and break the cycle.</p>.<p>There are varieties of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antiemetics/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anti-nausea</a> medications (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antiemetics/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">antiemetics</a>) that your doctor may prescribe.

Clear fluids should be attempted for the first 24 hours of an illness, and then the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> should be advanced as tolerated.</p>.<p>Clear fluids are easy for the stomach to absorb and include:</p>.<p>It is important not to take too much fluid at one time since stretching the stomach theoretically may cause nausea to worsen. One to two ounces of fluid at a time, taken every 10-15 minutes, may be all that the stomach will be able to tolerate. In infants and children, the amount may be as little as 5 or 10 cc's or less than a third of an ounce at a time.</p>.<p>Milk products should be avoided for the first 24-48 hours during an episode of nausea and vomiting. If the infection involves the small intestine, the enzyme that helps digest milk is located in cells lining the small intestine can become depleted.
