With the decrease in the female hormone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogen</a> that is related to aging and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause_and_perimenopause_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>, many women experience some changes in sexual function as they age, including poor vaginal lubrication and decreased genital sensation. Further, research suggests that low levels of the male hormone testosterone also contribute to a decline in sexual arousal, genital sensation, and orgasm. Researchers still are investigating the benefits of hormones and other medications, including drugs like 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sildenafil/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Viagra</a>, to treat sexual problems in women.
