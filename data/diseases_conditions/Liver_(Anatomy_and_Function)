<p><b><a name="what_is_the_function_of_liver_in_human_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The liver is one of the vital organs of the body, responsible for hundreds of chemical actions that the body needs to survive. It is also a gland because it secretes chemicals that are used by other parts of the body. For these reasons the liver is both an organ and a gland; in fact, it is the largest internal organ in the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_function_of_the_liver" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The liver has multiple functions. It makes many of the chemicals required by the body to function normally, it breaks down and detoxifies substances in the body, and it also acts as a storage unit.</p>.<p>Hepatocytes (hepar=liver + cyte=cell) are responsible for making many of the proteins (protein synthesis) in the body that are required for many functions, including blood clotting factors, and albumin, required to maintain fluid within the circulation system. The liver is also responsible for manufacturing cholesterol and triglycerides. Carbohydrates are also produced in the liver and the organ is responsible for turning glucose into glycogen that can be stored both in the liver and in the muscle cells. The liver also makes bile that helps with food <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a>.</p>.<p>The liver plays an important role in detoxifying the body by converting ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism in the body, into urea that is excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The liver also breaks down medications and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, including alcohol, and is responsible for breaking down insulin and other hormones in the body.</p>.<p>The liver is also storesÂ <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a> and chemicals that the body requires as building blocks.

Symptoms also may depend upon the type of liver disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_the_liver_look_like_and_where_is_it_located_in_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The liver is the largest internal organ of the body and is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and is protected by the lower right ribs. It also extends across the midline toward the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Should it become enlarged, the liver will grow further across the upper abdomen and down towards the navel (umbilicus).</p>.<p>The liver is divided into two lobes and has a rich blood supply obtained from two sources; 1) the portal vein delivers blood from the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestine, colon) and spleen, and 2) the hepatic artery supplies blood from the heart.</p>.<p>The biliary tree describes a system of tubes that collect bile, used to help digest food, and drains it into the gallbladder or the intestine. Intrahepatic ducts are located inside the liver (intra=inside + hepar=liver) while extrahepatic ducts are located outside the liver.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="liver_disease_causes_fatty_liver_cirrhosis_hepatitis_and_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many diseases may affect the liver directly or as a consequence of an illness or disease that begins in another organ.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Hepatitis</a> is an infection of the liver that causes liver inflammation.</p>.<p>Infections may affect the liver, including:</p>.<p><b><a name="liver_disease_causes_medications_toxins_genetics_cancer_and_others" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Liver inflammation is a relatively common side effect of medications.

On occasion, should the diagnosis be unclear or to assess the degree of damage to the liver, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">liver biopsy</a> may be necessary.</p>.<p>Using a very thin needle, a gastroenterologist or hepatologist (two types of liver specialists) or an interventional radiologist will insert a very fine needle through the skin and into the liver, to retrieve a small bit of tissue. This can then be examined under the microscope by a pathologist to help make the diagnosis. This procedure is done under sterile conditions to prevent infection, and a local anesthetic is injected into the skin to decrease the potential for pain.</p>.<p>If there is concern about only one area of the liver, instead of a disease that would affect the whole organ, an ultrasound may be used to help guide the needle into the proper position.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_diseases_of_the_liver_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
