Viruses can cause sickness. For example, the flu is caused by a virus. People can pass viruses to each other.

Inflammation is swelling that occurs when tissues of the body become injured or infected. Inflammation can cause organs to not work properly.

Symptoms of hepatitis A can occur 2 to 7 weeks after coming into contact with the virus. Children younger than age 6 may have no symptoms. Older children and adults often get mild, flulike symptoms. See a doctor right away if you or a child in your care has symptoms of hepatitis A.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hepatitis_a_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A blood test will show if you have hepatitis A. Blood tests are done at a doctor's office or outpatient facility. A blood sample is taken using a needle inserted into a vein in your arm or hand. The blood sample is sent to a lab to test for hepatitis A.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hepatitis_a_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hepatitis A usually gets better in a few weeks without treatment. However, some people can have symptoms for up to 6 months. Your doctor may suggest medicines to help relieve your symptoms. Talk with your doctor before taking prescription and over-the-counter medicines.
</p>.<p>
See your doctor regularly to make sure your body has fully recovered. If symptoms persist after 6 months, then you should see your doctor again.
</p>.<p>
When you recover, your body will have learned to fight off a future hepatitis A infection. However, you can still get other kinds of hepatitis.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_avoid_getting_hepatitis_a" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You can avoid getting hepatitis A by receiving the hepatitis A vaccine.</p>.<p>

Vaccines are medicines that keep you from getting sick. Vaccines teach the body to attack specific viruses and infections. The hepatitis A vaccine teaches your body to attack the hepatitis A virus.
</p>.<p>
The hepatitis A vaccine is given in two shots. The second shot is given 6 to 12 months after the first shot. You should get both hepatitis A vaccine shots to be fully protected.
</p>.<p>
All children should be vaccinated between 12 and 23 months of age. Discuss the hepatitis A vaccine with your child's doctor.
</p>.<p>
Adults at higher risk of getting hepatitis A and people with chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a> should also be vaccinated.
</p>.<p>
If you are traveling to countries where hepatitis A is common, including Mexico, try to get both shots before you go. If you don't have time to get both shots before you travel, get the first shot as soon as possible. Most people gain some protection within 2 weeks after the first shot.
</p>.<p>
You can also protect yourself and others from hepatitis A if you
