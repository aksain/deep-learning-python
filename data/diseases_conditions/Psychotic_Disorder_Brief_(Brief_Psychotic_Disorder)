<p><b><a name="brief_psychotic_disorder_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Brief psychotic disorder is one of a number of mental illnesses that are referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizophrenia</a> spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Characteristics of this disorder may include hallucinations or delusions that last no more than one month. Studies show that a true brief psychotic episode that does not progress to another mental illness occurs in anywhere from one to four per 100,000 people, more commonly in women than in men. This illness usually develops in people 30-50 years of age, and an episode tends to last an average of 17 days. This differs somewhat from people who suffer from any first-time psychotic episode, which occurs in about 100,000 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teens</a> and young adults in the United States every year, has a peak onset between the ages of 15-25 years, and more commonly affects males versus females.</p>.<p>In addition to the more commonly known mental disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizophrenia</a>, other mental disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders group includes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizotypal_personality_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizotypal personality disorder</a>, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizoaffective_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizoaffective disorder</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/catatonia_catatonic_behavior/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">catatonia</a>, substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, psychosis due to a medical condition, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, as well as unspecified schizophrenia spectrum, and other psychotic disorders. Besides catatonia, other catatonia-related disorders include catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, as well as unspecified catatonia.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Except for those psychotic disorders that result from the use of a substance or a medical condition, specific causes for most psychotic disorders are not known. However, the interplay of genetic (familial), biological, environmental, and psychological factors is thought to be involved. We do not yet understand all of the causes and other issues involved, but current research is making steady progress toward elucidating and defining causes of brief psychotic disorder and other psychotic disorders.</p>.<p>In biological models of psychotic disorders, genetic predisposition, infectious agents, toxins, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergies</a>, and disturbances in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss_boost_metabolism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a> have all been researched. Psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder are known to run in families. For example, people who have a close family member who has suffered from an episode of brief psychosis are more likely to develop the disorder than people with no such family history. Toxins like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/marijuana/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">marijuana</a> increase the risk of developing psychosis. Some medications are thought to be associated with developing, while not directly triggering, this illness in some people. Studies have not seemed to find ethnic differences in developing brief psychotic disorder.</p>.<p>The current concept is that multiple genes are involved in the development of psychosis and that risk factors such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prenatal</a> (intrauterine), perinatal (around the time of birth), and nonspecific stressors are involved in creating a disposition or vulnerability to develop the illness. Neurotransmitters (chemicals allowing the communication among nerve cells) have also been implicated in the development of psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder. The list of neurotransmitters under scrutiny is long, but special attention has been given to dopamine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">serotonin</a>, and glutamate.</p>.<p>One form of brief psychotic disorder referred to as brief reactive psychosis has been found to be triggered by very stressful experiences, like placement in solitary confinement. People who have a low income, are unemployed, or are living alone are at higher risk for developing brief psychotic disorder than those who do not have these experiences.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_brief_psychotic_disorder_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of brief psychotic disorder can include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since there is no specific test, like an X-ray, that can accurately diagnose a person with brief psychotic disorder, people who are concerned that they may suffer from this illness might consider taking a self-test, either an online or printable, like the Yale PRIME Screen, the Youth Psychosis at-Risk Test, the Schizophrenia Test, or the Early Psychosis Indicator.</p>.<p>To determine if a person suffers from brief psychotic disorder, health-care professionals will conduct a mental-health interview that looks for any history and the presence of symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, that were previously described. As with any mental-health evaluation, the practitioner will usually seek to rule out other mental-health conditions, including mood problems like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> disorders, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/panic_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">panic attacks</a> or generalized <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>, psychotic disorders other than brief psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or catatonia. In addition to guarding against having brief psychotic disorder misdiagnosed as another psychotic disorder or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/delirium/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">delirium</a> (sudden <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a> due to a medical or mental illness), the mental-health examiner may assess that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the diagnosis. Since brief psychotic disorder can co-occur with a life-threatening condition like delirium, the presence of those disorders will also likely be explored.</p>.<p>The process of determining the presence of brief psychotic disorder will also likely include the professional trying to ensure that the person does not have a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms that are similar to those of brief psychotic disorder. The mental-health professional will therefore often ask when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that may be necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical illness instead of or along with their emotional symptoms. Since the mental-health interview is used in making the diagnosis and the significant impact that having brief psychotic disorder or a related diagnosis can have on the person's life, it is of great importance that the practitioner conducts a comprehensive assessment.</p>.<p>In assessing for brief psychotic disorder, the evaluator will likely inquire if the individual's symptoms occur for the required one-day to one-month time period and are not better explained by a mood disorder (like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">major depression</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bipolar disorder</a> with psychotic features), another psychotic disorder, or is the result of the physical effects of a substance or other medical illness. The diagnosis should not be assigned if the person's symptoms are part of and sanctioned by the person's culture. Formerly, the term <em>brief reactive psychosis</em> was used to describe the situation in which brief psychotic disorder occurs in reaction to events that most people would feel are very stressful (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Given the brief duration of brief psychotic disorder, medications tend to be 
an important part of addressing many of its symptoms. The first line of 
treatment inclues atypical antipsychotics, for example: </p>.<p>The latter is rarely indicated specifically for the treatment of the 
brief psychotic disorder. This group of medications might cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight gain</a>, 
drowsiness, and changes ion <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reasons_for_blood_sugar_swings_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood sugar</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a>.</p>.<p>The first generation, or typical, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antipsychotic</a> medication 
also used for the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizophrenia</a>, and includes medications like:</p>.<p>These are now known as "neuroleptics" because, while they tend to be effective in treating positive symptoms of psychosis 
(for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paranoia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">paranoia</a> or other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/delusions/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">delusions</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hallucinations</a>), 
many of the side effects they can cause affect the neurologic (nervous) system. Examples of such side effects are muscle stiffness or rigidity, jitteriness, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>, and muscle twitches. 
These older medications are thought to be not as effective against so-called negative symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/catatonia_catatonic_behavior/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">catatonia</a>.</p>.<p>Since people with brief psychotic disorder are at increased risk of also having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, 
medications that address that symptom can be an important part of treatment. 
These include serotonergic medications like: </p>.<p>They are often prescribed because of their effectiveness and infrequent occurrence of side effects.

CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on helping the person understand and ultimately better manage how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_complications_of_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While most people who have an episode of brief psychotic disorder tend to never experience another one, some will go on to develop a more chronic psychotic mental illness like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Some may evolve into having psychosis as part of a mood or personality disorder. As such, individuals who have brief psychotic disorder can be susceptible to the unemployment, fractured relationships, medical illnesses, and even early mortality of these other psychotic disorders .</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of brief psychotic disorder tends to be better than that of other psychotic disorders and comparable to the prognosis of mood disorders that have psychotic features. Women, as well as anyone who has a history of having a healthy level of functioning before developing the illness, tend to recover best after suffering from brief psychotic disorder. Overall, women tend to recover and have no further recurrence of psychotic symptoms compared to men.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_brief_psychotic_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the person who has multiple risk factors for developing psychosis but has yet to have such symptoms, or who has had an episode of brief psychotic disorder, has been found to be effective at helping prevent such symptoms.
