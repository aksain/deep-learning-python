<p><b><a name="black_eye_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="black_eye_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A black eye often results from 
injury to the face or the head, and is caused 
when blood and other fluids collect in the space around the eye. Swelling and 
dark discoloration result in a "black eye" â€“ sometimes called a "shiner." </p>.<p>Most black eyes are relatively minor injuries. Many heal on their own in a 
few days, but they may signify a more serious injury.</p>.<p>Despite the name, "black eye," the eye itself is not 
usually injured. The tissues around the eye may be significantly discolored and 
swollen without any injury to the eye itself, like a 
bruise (ecchymosis) around the eye.</p>.<p>The skin around the eye is very loose, with mostly fat underneath it and fluid 
accumulates easily in this area. The skin around the eye is one of the first 
places to swell when the facial area is injured. Depending on the location and 
type of injury, one or both eyes may be affected. Injuries to the eyebrow, nose, and 
forehead area often result in black eyes because gravity pulls the blood and 
inflammatory fluid into the soft tissues under and around the eyes. </p>.<p>As a black eye heals, the swelling around the eye decreases, and the bruise 
gradually fades away. The bruising will usually start out a very dark purple, 
and as it fades, it may change to light purple, then greenish, then yellow 
before disappearing. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_black_eye" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common cause of a black eye is a blow to the eye, nose, or forehead. 
Depending on where the blow lands, one or both eyes may be affected.</p>.<p>A blow to the nose often causes both eyes to swell 
because the swelling from the nasal injury causes fluid to collect in the loose tissues of the eyelids. </p>.<p>Other causes of black eye include:</p>.<p>Other causes of swelling around the eye include (these conditions do not 
necessarily make the skin turn black and blue around the eye):</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_a_black_eye" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Edema</a> (swelling) and pain are the most common signs and symptoms of a black eye, 
and may be accompanied by discoloration caused by bruising. </p>.<p>Initially, the swelling and discoloration may be mild. The area around the eye often starts 
off slightly reddened, and then progresses to a darker shade and swelling 
increases. Some blurry vision or difficulty opening the eye may occur, but more 
serious visual problems are less common. Over the course of a few days, the area 
becomes lighter and the swelling decreases.</p>.<p>Signs of a more serious injury are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/double_vision/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">double vision</a>, loss 
of sight, or inability to move the eye. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Loss of consciousness</a>, blood or clear 
fluid coming out of the nose or the ears, blood on the surface of the eye 
itself, or persistent 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> can also indicate a severe injury. </p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_the_doctor_for_a_black_eye" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most black eyes are minor injuries that heal on their own in a few days with 
ice and OTC pain medications. Depending on the mechanism of injury and accompanying 
symptoms, an ophthalmologist might have to examine the injured eye to make sure 
that no significant injury to the eye has occurred. </p>.<p>Call a doctor if the patient:</p>.<p>Patient's should consult a health care practitioner any time they are unsure about treatment or 
concerned about symptoms. </p>.<p>Some conditions require immediate medical care. Call 9-1-1 or get to an 
emergency department 
immediately in the following situations:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_black_eye_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>FFor most black eyes, a doctor will perform a physical exam and 
will ask about the injury and look for any associated injuries or symptoms. </p>.<p>The physician will shine a light into the patient's eyes to look at the pupils and 
inside the eye itself for any injury, and to check for foreign bodies or 
abrasions on the eye. They will test the motion of the patient's eye (following the 
doctor's finger with his/her eyes), and examine the facial bones around the eye.
</p>.<p>Depending on what is found, the doctor may perform 
additional testing. An X-ray or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a> may be performed if the doctor 
suspects a fracture to the bones of the face or around the eye (the 
orbit) or that 
something is inside the eye. </p>.<p>If there are any special concerns, the doctor may refer the patient to a specialist, 
such as an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_care/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eye care</a> and 
surgery), for follow-up care.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_black_eye" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Home remedies</b></p>.<p>Home remedies for black eye include rest and ice applied early after the 
injury help to decrease swelling and pain. </p>.<p>Ice helps decrease swelling by constricting blood vessels, by decreasing 
fluid accumulation, and by cooling and numbing the area.</p>.<p>FFor simple, uncomplicated black eyes, the treatment prescribed by health care 
professionals is similar to home treatment: </p>.<p>Avoid possibly injurious activities until after the eye has 
healed.</p>.<p>For more complicated injuries, the patient may be referred to an appropriate 
specialist; such as an ophthalmologist, who can treat the patient's injuries to the eye 
itself, or an otorhinolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat [ENT]), or an 
oral/maxillofacial surgeon for 
fractures to the face. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_black_eye" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Black eye in itself usually is a minor condition that 
resolves on its own. Severe injuries, especially forceful blunt <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> to the eye area may result in 
complications. </p>.<p><b>Traumatic 
uveitis and 
iritis</b>(iritis is a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/uveitis_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">uveitis</a>) results from blunt trauma to 
the eye. A black eye may be the first sign of this condition. Iritis generally 
affects only one eye. Signs and symptoms of uveitis (and iritis) may include:</p>.<p>Any of these symptoms 
should be brought to the attention of a physician. </p>.<p><b>Hyphema</b> is an accumulation of blood in the front 
(anterior) chamber of the 
eye following injury and can cause damage to the interior tissues of the eye. 
The amount of blood may be too small to see with the naked eye, or the entire 
front of the eye may fill with blood. </p>.<p><b>Glaucoma</b> may also result from blunt trauma to the eye, 
and can occur immediately or years later. The force of the trauma can cause 
bleeding inside the eye which leads to an increase in eye pressure, and damages 
the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">optic nerve</a>. Delayed onset <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/glaucoma_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glaucoma</a> (angle recession glaucoma) can occur as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scar tissue</a> from 
the injury builds in the eye. </p>.<p><b>Orbital floor fracture</b> (blowout fracture) may also occur 
as a result of the forceful blunt trauma to the eye. The force of the blow 
pushes the eyeball further into the eye socket, fracturing the very thin walls 
of bone that make up the eye socket. This can lead to pinching (entrapment) of 
the optic nerve and 
the muscles that move the eye. Loss of vision or double vision can result and 
must be treated emergently. </p>.<p><b>Retinal detachment</b> can result in permanent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vision loss</a>. 
Trauma to the eye can lift or pull the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">retina</a> from its normal position, lining the back of the 
eyeball. Symptoms include partial or total loss of vision or flashing lights or 
spots in the field of vision and must be treated immediately. </p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG-->
