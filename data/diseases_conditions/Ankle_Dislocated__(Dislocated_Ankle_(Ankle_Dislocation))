	The ankle is a hinge joint that connects the lower leg to the foot. The tibia and fibula of the leg come into contact with the talus of the foot, forming the ankle mortise. The majority of the weight bearing in the ankle occurs between the tibia and talus. While the shape of the mortise helps align the ankle joint, the surrounding ligaments are very important in providing stability.</p>.<p>
	A dislocated joint describes the situation where the bones that come together to form a joint no longer maintain that normal relationship. In the ankle, it means that the tibia and talus no longer maintain their normal anatomic relationship.</p>.<p>
	Most commonly, a dislocated ankle is associated with fractures of the distal ends of the tibia and fibula (called the malleolus) in association with damage to the ligaments that help support the ankle joint. Less commonly, isolated ligament injuries can result in the dislocation.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_an_ankle_dislocation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ankle dislocations do not happen spontaneously but are a result of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>. 
Forces are placed on the ankle that cause the bones to fracture or the ligaments 
to tear, resulting in the dislocation injury. </p>.<p>The ankle is an inherently stable joint and the direction of the dislocation 
depends upon the position of the foot and where the force arises. Ankle 
dislocations are more often associated with fractures of the bones that make up 
the joint. </p>.<p>Common causes of dislocations are include falls, motor-vehicle crashes, and 
sports injuries. </p>.<p>The most common type of ankle dislocation is posterior, where the talus moves 
backward in relation to the tibia. For this to occur, the foot needs to be 
plantar flexed (the toes are pointing downward) when the injury occurs. The 
ankle is either forced inward from the outside (inversion) or outward from the 
inside (eversion), tearing the ligaments and tissues that hold the ankle stable.
</p>.<p>Anterior dislocations, where the talus is pushed forward, occur when the 
foot is fixed or dorsiflexed (where the toes are pointed upward). The force from 
in front of the foot pushes the tibia backward. </p>.<p>Lateral dislocations occur when the ankle is twisted, either inverted or 
everted, but there are always fractures associated with either the medial or 
lateral malleolus or both. </p>.<p>Superior dislocation describes where the talus is jammed upward, into the 
space between the tibia and fibula, as a result of an axial loading injury. This 
may be due to landing on one's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> from a fall or from being in a car wreck 
where the foot is held firm against the brake pedal. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_dislocated_ankle_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dislocations are painful, and there is usually obvious deformity of the ankle 
joint. It may be very difficult or impossible to stand or walk. </p>.<p>If the nerves that run across the ankle joint are damaged or inflamed, there 
can be numbness and tingling of the foot. </p>.<p>There is almost immediate swelling of the ankle joint area and ecchymosis 
(bruising) may occur quickly. </p>.<p>Depending upon the mechanism of injury, there can be associated other 
injuries of the foot, knee, or spine. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health-care_professionals_diagnose_a_dislocated_ankle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is important for the health-care professional to take a history as to how 
the injury occurred. Appreciating the mechanism helps makes sense of the injury 
and may help direct treatment. Past medical history and previous ankle injury 
may provide useful information. </p>.<p>The dislocated ankle is often diagnosed clinically by the appearance of the 
ankle. Physical examination can determine the abnormal relationship of the 
tibia, fibula, and talus. In addition to the ankle, the health-care professional 
may also exam the structures of the foot and knee, looking for other potential 
associated injuries. </p>.<p>Because blood vessels and nerves can become stretched and damaged when the 
ankle dislocates, pulses and sensation in the foot are evaluated. Skin 
complications are common because as the skin stretches over a bony prominence 
when the ankle is dislocated, it can lose its blood supply and die. </p>.<p>X-ray is the initial diagnostic test used to determine the extent of injury, 
where the bones are in relation to each other and whether a fracture is present. 
Once the dislocation is reduced and the bones realigned, another post-reduction 
X-ray may be done to confirm that realignment is good (bones in normal 
position). Depending upon the situation, CT or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a> scans might be considered to 
evaluate damage to the joint surface, to look for occult or hidden fractures, and 
to assess the ligaments and tendons that surround and stabilize the ankle joint.
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_dislocated_ankle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Once the initial evaluation is complete, the goal of emergency treatment of 
an ankle dislocation begins with trying to reduce the injury, returning the 
bones as close as possible to their normal anatomic position. Often the bones 
will fall back into place with gentle traction. Sometimes medication is required 
to sedate the patient and help the surrounding muscles relax. </p>.<p>If there is evidence that the blood and nerve supply to the foot are in 
jeopardy or if the skin is tented and stretched and the clinical diagnosis of 
ankle dislocation is made, attempts to reduce the ankle joint may be necessary 
even before an X-ray is taken to preserve nerve and blood vessel function. </p>.<p>Once the ankle is reduced, examination of the blood and nerve supply to the 
foot is repeated and a temporary plaster or fiberglass splint is placed. </p>.<p>An orthopedic or podiatric consultation may need to occur emergently, 
especially if there are unstable fractures present, if nerve or artery damage 
exists, or if the ankle cannot be reduced and an emergency operation is needed.
</p>.<p>Even if the ankle dislocation is reduced, many times an operation is 
eventually required to stabilize the structures that were damaged. The decision 
as to whether surgery is required and what type of surgery might be needed is 
individualized for each patient and their situation. </p>.<p>After the initial treatment is complete, whether or not surgery is required, 
rehabilitation may take six to 12 weeks before returning the patient to their 
pre-injury activities. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_an_ankle_dislocation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the goal for every injury is to return the patient to their pre-injury 
level of function, patients who have dislocated their ankle may not necessarily 
be able to achieve that goal. </p>.<p>When the ankle dislocates, blood supply to the cartilage that lines the bone 
within the joint may be damaged, eventually leading to arthritis (arthro=joint + 
it is=inflammation). As well, if the bones do not perfectly align after injury, 
the risk of arthritis in the future increases. </p>.<p>Arthritis of the joint may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> and stiffness. Loss of range of motion 
in the ankle can alter gait, the motion of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a>, and subsequently affect 
other parts of the skeleton including the hips and back. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_a_dislocated_ankle" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A dislocated ankle is an accidental injury and most often cannot be
