Gastric bypass surgery combines the creation of a small stomach pouch to restrict food intake and construction of bypasses of the duodenum and other segments of the small intestine to cause malabsorption (decreased ability to absorb calories and nutrients from food).</p>.<p><b><a name="types_of_gastric_bypass_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Gastric bypass surgery that causes malabsorption and restricts food intake produces more <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a> than restriction operations like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lap_band_surgery_gastric_banding/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gastric banding</a>, which only decrease food intake. People who have bypass surgery generally lose two-thirds of their excess weight within two years.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="risks_of_gastric_bypass_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who undergo gastric bypass surgery are at risk for: </p>.<p>Gastric bypass surgery also may cause "dumping syndrome," whereby stomach 
contents move too rapidly through the small intestine. Symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sweating</a>, faintness, and, occasionally, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> after eating, as well 
as the inability to eat sweets without becoming extremely weak. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gallstones/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Gallstones</a> can 
occur in response to rapid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>. They can be dissolved with medication 
taken after the surgery. </p>.<p><b><a name="complications_from_nutritional_deficiencies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The limited absorption of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyanocobalamin_tablets-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin B-12</a> and iron can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a>. The lack of 
calcium absorption can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a> and metabolic bone disease. People who 
undergo this procedure are required to take nutritional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a> that usually 
prevent these deficiencies. </p>.<p>The more extensive the gastric bypass surgery, the greater the risk for 
complications and nutritional deficiencies. People who undergo extensive 
bypasses of the normal digestive process require not only close monitoring, but 
also lifelong use of special foods and medications. </p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
