<p><b><a name="obesity_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The definition of obesity varies depending on what one reads. In general, overweight and obesity indicate a weight greater than what is healthy. Obesity is a chronic condition defined by an excess amount of body fat. A certain amount of body fat is necessary for storing energy, heat insulation, shock absorption, and other functions.</p>.<p>Body mass index best defines obesity. A person's height and weight determines his or her body mass index. The body mass index (BMI) equals a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared (more information will be found later in the article). Since BMI describes body weight relative to height, there is a strong correlation with total body fat content in adults. An adult who has a BMI of 25-29.9 is overweight, and an adult who has a BMI over 30 is obese. A person with a BMI of 18.5-24.9 has a normal weight. A person is morbidly obese (extreme obesity) if his or her BMI is over 40.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Over two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and one in three Americans is obese. The prevalence of obesity in children has increased markedly. Obesity has also been increasing rapidly throughout the world, and the incidence of obesity nearly doubled from 1991 to 1998. Nearly 37% of adults in the U.S. were obese in 2014.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_health_risks_associated_with_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Obesity is not just a cosmetic consideration; it is harmful to one's health as it is a risk factor for many conditions. In the United States, roughly 112,000 deaths per year are directly related to obesity, and most of these deaths are in patients with a BMI over 30. Patients with a BMI over 40 have a reduced life expectancy. Obesity also increases the risk of developing a number of chronic diseases, including the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The balance between calorie intake and energy expenditure determines a person's weight. If a person eats more calories than he or she burns (metabolizes), the person gains weight (the body will store the excess energy as fat). If a person eats fewer calories than he or she metabolizes, he or she will lose weight. Therefore, the most common causes of obesity are overeating and physical inactivity. Ultimately, body weight is the result of genetics, metabolism, environment, behavior, and culture.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_other_factors_associated_with_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_methods_measure_body_fat" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>BMI is a calculated value and approximates the body's fat percentage. Actually measuring a person's body fat percentage is not easy and is often inaccurate without careful monitoring of the methods. The following methods require special equipment, trained personnel, can be costly, and some are only available in certain research facilities.</p>.<p>The following two methods are simple and straightforward:</p>.<p>Health clubs and weight-loss centers often use the skin caliper or bioelectric impedance analysis method; however, these can yield inaccurate results if an inexperienced person performs them or they are used on someone with significant obesity.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_weight-for-height_tables_useful_to_determine_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Measuring a person's body fat percentage can be difficult, so other methods are often relied upon to diagnose obesity. Two widely used methods are weight-for-height tables and body mass index (BMI). While both measurements have their limitations, they are reasonable indicators that someone may have a weight problem. The calculations are easy, and no special equipment is required.</p>.<p>Most people are familiar with weight-for-height tables. Although such tables have existed for a long time, in 1943, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company introduced their table based on policyholders' data to relate weight to disease and mortality. Doctors and nurses (and many others) have used these tables for decades to determine if someone is overweight. The tables usually have a range of acceptable weights for a person of a given height.</p>.<p>One problem with using weight-for-height tables is that doctors disagree over which is the best table to use. Several versions are available. Many have different weight ranges, and some tables account for a person's frame size, age and sex, while other tables do not.</p>.<p>A significant limitation of all weight-for-height tables is that they do not distinguish between excess fat and muscle. A very muscular person may be classified as obese, according to the tables, when he or she in fact is not.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_body_mass_index_bmi" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The body mass index (BMI) is a now the measurement of choice for many physicians and researchers studying obesity.</p>.<p>The BMI uses a mathematical formula that accounts for both a person's weight and height.</p>.<p>The BMI measurement, however, poses some of the same problems as the weight-for-height tables. Not everyone agrees on the cutoff points for "healthy" versus "unhealthy" BMI ranges. BMI also does not provide information on a person's percentage of body fat. However, like the weight-for-height table, BMI is a useful general guideline and is a good estimator of body fat for most adults 19 and 70 years of age. However, it may not be an accurate measurement of body fat for bodybuilders, certain athletes, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> women.</p>.<p>The BMI equals a person's weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (BMI = kg/m<sup>2</sup>). To calculate the BMI using pounds, divide the weight in pounds by the height in inches squared and multiply the result by 703.</p>.<p>It is important to understand what "healthy weight" means. Healthy weight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 19 and less than 25 among all people 20 years of age or over. Generally, obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30, which approximates 30 pounds of excess weight.</p>.<p>The World Health Organization uses a classification system using the BMI to define overweight and obesity.</p>.<p>The table below has already done the math and metric conversions. To use the table, find the appropriate height in the left-hand column. Move across the row to the given weight. The number at the top of the column is the BMI for that height and weight.</p>.<p class="credits"><i>Table Courtesy of the National Institutes of Health</i><br><br><b>Below is a table identifying the risk of associated disease according to BMI and waist size</b>.</p>.<p class="credits">* Disease risk for type 2 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">hypertension</a>, and CVD.<br><br>+ Increased waist circumference can also be a marker for increased risk even in persons of normal weight.</p>.<p class="credits"><i>Table Courtesy of the National Institutes of Health</i><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="does_it_matter_where_body_fat_is_located_is_it_worse_to_be_an_apple_or_a%0Apear" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Concern is directed not only at how much fat a person has but also where that fat is located on the body. The pattern of body fat distribution tends to differ in men and women.</p>.<p>In general, women collect fat in their hips and buttocks, giving their figures a "pear" shape. Men, on the other hand, usually collect fat around the belly, giving them more of an "apple" shape. (This is not a hard and fast rule; some men are pear-shaped and some women become apple-shaped, particularly after menopause.)</p>.<p>Apple-shaped people whose fat is concentrated mostly in the abdomen are more likely to develop many of the health problems associated with obesity. They are at increased health risk because of their fat distribution. While obesity of any kind is a health risk, it is better to be a pear than an apple.</p>.<p>In order to sort the types of fruit, doctors have developed a simple way to determine whether someone is an apple or a pear. The measurement is called waist-to-hip ratio. To find out a person's waist-to-hip ratio</p>.<p>Women with waist-to-hip ratios of more than 0.8 and men with waist-to-hip ratios of more than 1.0 are "apples."</p>.<p>Another rough way of estimating the amount of a person's abdominal fat is by measuring the waist circumference. Men with a waist circumference of 40 inches or greater and women with a waist circumference of 35 inches or greater are considered to have increased health risks related to obesity.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_about_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>All too often, obesity prompts a strenuous diet in the hopes of reaching the "ideal body weight." Some amount of weight loss may be accomplished, but the lost weight usually quickly returns. Most people who lose weight regain the weight within five years. It is clear that a more effective, long-lasting treatment for obesity must be found.</p>.<p>We need to learn more about the causes of obesity, and then we need to change the ways we treat it. When obesity is accepted as a chronic disease, it will be treated like other chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The treatment of obesity cannot be a short-term "fix" but has to be an ongoing lifelong process.</p>.<p>Obesity treatment must acknowledge that even modest weight loss can be beneficial. For example, a modest weight loss of 5%-10% of the initial weight, and long-term maintenance of that weight loss can bring significant health gains, including</p>.<p>It is not necessary to achieve an "ideal weight" to derive health benefits from obesity treatment. Instead, the goal of treatment should be to reach and hold to a "healthier weight." The emphasis of treatment should be to commit to the process of lifelong healthy living, including eating more wisely and increasing physical activity.</p>.<p>In sum, the goal in dealing with obesity is to achieve and maintain a "healthier weight."<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_role_of_physical_activity_and_exercise_in_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES I) showed that people who engage in limited recreational activity were more likely to gain weight than more active people. Other studies have shown that people who engage in regular strenuous activity gain less weight than sedentary people.</p>.<p>Physical activity and exercise help burn calories. The amount of calories burned depends on the type, duration, and intensity of the activity. It also depends on the weight of the person. A 200-pound person will burn more calories running 1 mile than a 120-pound person, because the work of carrying those extra 80 pounds must be factored in. But exercise as a treatment for obesity is most effective when combined with a diet and weight-loss program. Exercise alone without dietary changes will have a limited effect on weight because one has to exercise a lot to simply lose 1 pound. However regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight for the long term. Another advantage of regular exercise as part of a weight-loss program is a greater loss of body fat versus lean muscle compared to those who diet alone.</p>.<p>Remember, these health benefits can occur independently (with or without) achieving weight loss. Before starting an exercise program, talk to a doctor about the type and intensity of the exercise program.</p>.<p>The following people should consult a doctor before vigorous exercise:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_role_of_diet_in_the_treatment_of_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first goal of dieting is to stop further weight gain. The next goal is to establish realistic weight-loss goals. While the ideal weight corresponds to a BMI of 20-25, this is difficult to achieve for many people. Thus, success is higher when a goal is set to lose 10%-15% of baseline weight as opposed to 20%-30% or greater. It is also important to remember that any weight reduction in an obese person would result in health benefits.</p>.<p>One effective way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories. One pound is equal to 3,500 calories. In other words, you have to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume to lose 1 pound. Most adults need between 1,200-2,800 calories per day, depending on body size and activity level to meet the body's energy needs.</p>.<p>If you skip that bowl of ice cream, then you will be one-seventh of the way to losing that pound! Losing 1 pound per week is a safe and reasonable way to take off extra pounds. The higher the initial weight of a person, the more quickly he/she will achieve weight loss. This is because for every 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight, approximately 22 calories are required to maintain that weight. So for a woman weighing 100 kilograms (220 pounds), he or she would require about 2,200 calories a day to maintain his or her weight, while a person weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds) would require only about 1,320 calories. If both ate a calorie-restricted diet of 1,200 calories per day, the heavier person would lose weight faster. Age also is a factor in calorie expenditure. Metabolic rate tends to slow as we age, so the older a person is, the harder it is to lose weight.</p>.<p>There is controversy in regard to carbohydrates (low carbohydrate diet) and weight loss. When carbohydrates are restricted, people often experience rapid initial weight loss within the first two weeks. This weight loss is due mainly to fluid loss. When carbohydrates are added back to the diet, weight gain often occurs, simply due to a regain of the fluid.</p>.<p>Other diets such as low-fat diets all show a similar pattern of weight loss that is difficult to maintain if there are not additional general lifestyle changes.</p>.<p><b>General diet guidelines for achieving and (just as importantly) maintaining a healthy weight</b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_role_of_medication_in_the_treatment_of_obesity" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Medication treatment of obesity should be used only in patients who have health risks related to obesity. Medications should be used in patients with a BMI greater than 30 or in those with a BMI of greater than 27 who have other medical conditions (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high blood pressure</a>, diabetes, high blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a>) that put them at risk for developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">heart disease</a>. Medications should not be used for cosmetic reasons.</p>.<p>Medications should only be used as an adjunct to diet modifications and an exercise program.</p>.<p>Like diet and exercise, the goal of medication treatment has to be realistic. With successful medication treatment, one can expect an initial weight loss of at least 5 pounds during the first month of treatment, and a total weight loss of 10%-15% of the initial body weight. It is also important to remember that these medications only work when they are taken. When they are discontinued, weight gain often occurs.</p>.<p>The first class (category) of medication used for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight control</a> cause symptoms that mimic the sympathetic nervous system. They cause the body to feel "under <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a>" or "nervous." As a result, the major side effect of this class of medication is high blood pressure. This class of medication includes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sibutramine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sibutramine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sibutramine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Meridia</a>, which was taken off the market in the U.S. in October 2010 due to safety concerns) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phentermine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">phentermine</a> (Adipex P). These medications also decrease appetite and create a sensation of fullness. Hunger and fullness (satiety) are regulated by brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Examples of neurotransmitters include serotonin, norepinephrine, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dopamine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dopamine</a>. Anti-obesity medications that suppress appetite do so by increasing the level of these neurotransmitters at the junction (called synapse) between nerve endings in the brain.</p>.<p>Phentermine (Fastin, Adipex P) -- the other half of fen/phen -- suppresses appetite by causing a release of norepinephrine in the body. Phentermine alone is still available for treatment of obesity but only on a short-term basis (a few weeks). The common side effects of phentermine include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">insomnia</a>, irritability, and nervousness. Fenfluramine (the fen of fen/phen) and dexfenfluramine (Redux) suppress appetite mainly by increasing release of serotonin by the cells. Both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were withdrawn from the market in September 1997 because of association of these two medications with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pulmonary hypertension</a> (a rare but serious disease of the arteries in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>) and association of fen/phen with damage to the heart valves. Since the withdrawal of fenfluramine, some have suggested combining phentermine with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluoxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">fluoxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluoxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Prozac</a>), a combination that has been referred to as phen/pro. However, no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a> have been conducted to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this combination.

This is a class of anti-obesity drugs called lipase inhibitors, or fat blockers. Fat from food can only be absorbed into the body after being broken up (a process called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a>) by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/digestive_enzymes-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">digestive enzymes</a> called lipases in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a>. By inhibiting the action of lipase enzymes, orlistat prevents the intestinal absorption of fat by 30%. Drugs in this class do not affect brain chemistry. Theoretically, orlistat also should have minimal or no systemic side effects (side effects in other parts of the body) because the major locale of action is inside the gut lumen and very little of the drug is absorbed.</p>.<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved orlistat capsules, branded as alli, as an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) treatment for overweight adults in February 2007. The drug had previously been approved in 1999 as a prescription weight loss aid, whose brand name is Xenical. The OTC preparation has a lower dosage than prescription Xenical.</p>.<p>Orlistat is recommended only for people 18 years of age and over in combination with a diet and exercise regimen. People who have difficulties with the absorption of food or who are not overweight should not take orlistat. Overweight is defined by the U.S. National Institutes of Health as having a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or greater.</p>.<p>Orlistat can be taken up to three times a day, with each fat-containing meal. The drug may be taken during the meal or up to one hour after the meal. If the meal is missed or is very low in fat content, the medications should not be taken.</p>.<p>The most common side effects of orlistat are changes in bowel habits. These include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gas</a>, the urgent need to have a bowel movement, oily bowel movements, oily discharge or spotting with bowel movements, an increased frequency of bowel movements, and the inability to control bowel movements. Women may also notice irregularities in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstrual cycle</a> while taking orlistat. Side effects are most common in the first few weeks after beginning to take orlistat. In some people, the side effects persist for as long as they are taking the drug.</p>.<p>People with diabetes, thyroid conditions, who have received an organ transplant, or who are taking prescription medications that affect blood clotting should check with their physician before using OTC orlistat (alli), since <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_interactions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drug interactions</a> with certain medications are possible.</p>.<p>A long-term decrease in fat absorption can cause deficiency of fat-soluble <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a> (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">vitamins</a> A, D, E, K).

Ephedrine use has been associated with high blood pressure, heart-rhythm irregularities, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strokes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_tips_avoid_insomnia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">insomnia</a>, seizures <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tremors</a>, and nervousness.

A typical meal substitute available in powder and liquid form is Slim-Fast. Ensure is another meal substitute available in both liquid and bars. Meal substitutes should provide protein and be low in fat and calories. The label should include the amount of calories per serving and the percentages of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. The total number of calories per serving is predetermined so it is easier to keep track of the daily consumption of calories. As with all dramatic changes in your diet, you should consult your health care provider to make sure that these changes will not have negative consequences.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/artificial_sweeteners/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Saccharin</a> (Sweet'N Low) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/artificial_sweeteners/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aspartame</a> (Equal) are sugar substitutes that provide little or no calories. They may be used as a substitute for table sugar. Using saccharin instead of a teaspoonful of sugar eliminates 33 calories from the diet. People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phenylketonuria/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">phenylketonuria</a> (a serious <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genetic disease</a> in which an individual is unable to break down and eliminate an amino acid, phenylalanine) should not use aspartame because it contains phenylalanine.</p>.<p>Fructose, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sorbitol-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sorbitol</a>, and xylitol may be used as alternatives to sugar, but they provide more calories than saccharin and aspartame. Excessive use of sorbitol also may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>.</p>.<p>Despite claims by manufacturers, the use of OTC products alone does not cause weight loss. Herbal weight-loss products or preparations called "fat burners" are even more misleading. These products may contain a combination of ma huang (a botanical source of ephedrine), white willow (a source of salicin), Hoodia gordonii, and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guarana_paullinia_cupana-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">guarana</a> or kola nut (a source of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">caffeine</a>). These agents are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a>, which theoretically increase the metabolism and help the body break down fat. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that they are effective for weight loss. In addition, ma huang has been linked to serious side effects such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a>, seizures, and death. Chromium also is a popular ingredient in weight-loss products, but there is no evidence that chromium has any effect on weight loss.</p>.<p>Weight-loss teas contain strong botanical laxatives (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sennosides_aandb-oral_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Senna</a>, cascara sagrada) and diuretics (<i>Rhamnus purshiana</i>) that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">loss of water</a> from the body. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Diarrhea</a> and water loss lead to the depletion of sodium and potassium and can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a>. Although an individual's weight may decrease, the loss is due to a decrease in fluid and is only temporary. Moreover, low sodium and potassium levels may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abnormal heart rhythms</a> and can even lead to death.</p>.<p>Guar gum preparations have also been promoted as a weight-loss agent. Guar gum is thought to work by leading to a feeling of fullness early in the meal. It has not been scientifically proven and has been associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, gas, and diarrhea.</p>.<p>All of the OTC products discussed above are not considered drugs and are therefore not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Each group had similar body weight at baseline (the start of the study). At two years, diabetes and high blood pressure were lower in the patients treated with surgery.</p>.<p>Surgical procedures of the upper gastrointestinal tract are collectively called bariatric surgery. The initial surgeries performed were the jejunocolic bypass and the jejunoileal bypass (where the small bowel is diverted to the large bowel, bypassing a lot of the surface area where food would have been absorbed). These procedures were fraught with problems and are no longer performed. Currently, procedures used include making the stomach area smaller or bypassing the stomach completely.</p>.<p>Currently, there are basically two types of bariatric surgery:</p>.<p><b>Restrictive surgeries</b>: These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach and slow down digestion.</p>.<p><b>Malabsorptive/restrictive surgeries</b>: These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach but also bypass or remove part of your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestive system</a> to decrease absorption of food/calories.</p>.<p>In the cases of making the stomach smaller, vertically banded gastroplasty is the most common procedure, where the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> is banded early in the stomach. The other procedure is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lap_band_surgery_gastric_banding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">gastric banding</a>, where an inflatable pouch causes gastric constriction. Changing the volume in the ring that encircles the stomach can change the amount of constriction. Gastric bypass essentially causes weight loss by bypassing the stomach.</p>.<p>The most common malabsorptive surgery is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, in which the stomach is stapled to create a small pouch, and then part of the intestine is attached to this pouch to decrease food absorption.</p>.<p>The surgical treatment of obesity and the surgical procedures are evolving constantly and frequently are done by laparoscopic methods (using tiny incisions and a camera to carry out the surgery). Although these procedures are becoming more routine, the mortality rate for these procedures is still between 0.5%-2% with a significant incidence of complications.</p>.<p>The risks of surgery include the usual complications of infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> in the lower extremities (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">deep vein thrombosis</a>) and in the lungs (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_embolism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pulmonary embolism</a>), and anesthesia risk. Specific long-term risks related to obesity surgery include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iron_and_iron_deficiency/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lack of iron</a> absorption and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">iron deficiency anemia</a>. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also develop and could lead to nerve damage (neuropathies). Rapid weight loss may also be associated with gallstones. Bariatric surgery should be performed at a center with a whole weight-loss program in place that includes dieticians and therapists and follow-up care.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_people_choose_a_safe_and_successful_weight-loss_program" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Scientists have made tremendous strides in understanding obesity and in improving the medication treatment of this important disease. In time, better, safer, and more effective obesity medications will be available. But currently there is still no "magic cure" for obesity. The best and safest way to lose fat and keep it off is through a commitment to a lifelong process of proper diet and regular exercise. Medications should be considered helpful adjuncts to diet and exercise for patients whose health risk from obesity clearly outweigh the potential side effects of the medications. Medications should be prescribed by doctors familiar with the patients' conditions and with the use of the medications. Medication(s) and other "herbal" preparations with unproven effectiveness and safety should be avoided.</p>.<p>Almost any of the commercial weight-loss programs can work but only if they motivate you sufficiently to decrease the amount of calories you eat or increase the amount of calories you burn each day (or both). What elements of a weight-loss program should a consumer look for in judging its potential for safe and successful weight loss? A responsible and safe weight-loss program should be able to document for you the five following features:</p>.<p>Obesity is a chronic condition. Too often it is viewed as a temporary problem that can be treated for a few months with a strenuous diet. However, as most overweight people know, weight control must be considered a lifelong effort. To be safe and effective, any weight-loss program must address the long-term approach or else the program is largely a waste of time, money, and energy.</p>.<p>Maintaining your ideal body weight is a balancing act between food consumption and calories needed by the body for energy. You are what you eat. The kinds and amounts of food you eat affect your ability to maintain your ideal weight and to lose weight.</p>.<p>Medical science has established that eating proper foods can influence health for all age groups. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's current dietary guidelines state the following:</p>
