The issue is not "damage" to existing restorations; rather, keep in mind that existing restorations such as tooth-colored fillings, crowns, bonding, veneers, and bridges do not lighten. This means that any preexisting dental work may need to be replaced to match the new tooth shade achieved in the natural teeth, should a bleaching process proceed.</p>.<p><b>Do teeth whiteners damage a tooth's nerve?</b><br>There's no evidence to date that the tooth whitening process has a harmful effect on the health of a tooth's nerve. One study reported that at both a 4.5 and 7-year follow up, no individual who used a tooth whitening system needed a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/root_canal/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">root canal</a> procedure on any teeth that had been whitened.</p>.<p><font face="arial" size="1">Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.<br>Edited by Charlotte E.
