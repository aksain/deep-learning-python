<p><b><a name="sapho_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_sapho_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>SAPHO syndrome is a chronic disorder that involves the skin, bone, and joints. SAPHO is an acronym for the combination of synovitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_visual_dictionary_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">acne</a>, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis.</p>.<p><b>S</b>ynovitis means inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). Typically, this is manifests as warmth, tenderness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>, swelling, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_stiffness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stiffness</a> of involved joints (arthritis).</p>.<p><b>A</b>cne is a skin condition featuring tiny areas of inflammation with pus formation at the hair follicles. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Acne</a> occurs most commonly on the face and upper back.</p>.<p><b>P</b>ustulosis is a very inflammatory skin condition resulting in large fluid-filled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blister</a>-like areas (pustules), typically on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>. The skin of these areas peels and flakes (exfoliates).</p>.<p><b>H</b>yperostosis means abnormal excessive growth of bone. The hyperostosis of the SAPHO syndrome frequently is located at the points of the bone where tendons attach, generally in the chest wall.</p>.<p><b>O</b>steitis means inflammation of the bone. Patients with SAPHO syndrome can develop inflammation of the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis) as well as inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) which leads to stiffness and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> of the neck and back.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_sapho_syndrome_and_what_are_risk_factors_for_developing_it" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The precise cause of SAPHO syndrome is not known. It is felt that the tendency toward developing SAPHO syndrome can be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>. Genetic predisposition is suggested by the higher prevalence of HLA-B27, an inherited blood marker, in patients with SAPHO syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_sapho_syndrome_related_to_other_joint_conditions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some researchers feel that the SAPHO syndrome is related to the group of arthritis conditions that typically affect the spine, called the spondyloarthropathies. For further information, please read the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ankylosing_spondylitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Ankylosing Spondylitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reactive_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Reactive Arthritis</a> articles.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_sapho_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>SAPHO syndrome causes inflammation of joints with pain, stiffness, swelling, warmth, and redness. Joints affected can be spinal or away from the spine (peripheral joints) such as the fingers, wrists, or knees. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/acne_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Acne</a> of the skin and pustules of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are characteristic.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_sapho_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>SAPHO syndrome is diagnosed clinically by identifying the characteristic features of the syndrome including synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. The blood test marker antigen HLA-B27, when present, supports the diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_sapho_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of patients with SAPHO syndrome is directed toward the individual symptoms that are present. Generally, treatment involves medications that reduce inflammation in the particular tissues affected. Examples of medications that are used for inflammation include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a>, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Motrin</a>], and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">naproxen</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aleve</a>]) and cortisone medications (either in the form of topical creams, tablets, or by injection into the involved area). Topical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold</a> applications can also help reduce inflammation in some tissues. For patients with persisting joint symptoms, both <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfasalazine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sulfasalazine</a> (Azulfidine) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">methotrexate</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Rheumatrex</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Trexall</a>) have been tried with varying degrees of success.
