<p><b><a name="what_is_portal_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> serves many purposes within the body from making carbohydrates, 
proteins and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fat_and_fats_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fats</a> to synthesizing bile to help digest found. Because of this, 
the liver requires a significant blood supply. As opposed to other organs in the 
body, the majority of this blood supply (75%) comes from the venous system 
through the portal system. Blood vessels from the stomach, small intestine, 
pancreas, and spleen converge and form the portal vein delivering nutrients and 
chemical building blocks to the liver. Once in the liver, the portal vein and 
hepatic artery (which accounts for 25% of the liver's blood supply) come 
together to form sinusoids, spaces where the blood is filtered. From there, 
blood makes its way to the Vena cava, the largest vein in the body to return to 
the heart.</p>.<p>Portal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> describes elevated pressure within the portal system, 
including the portal vein and the tributary veins that drain into it. The 
pressure within the portal system is not normally measured and is not an issue 
except if an illness or disease occurs that makes it difficult for blood to flow 
through the liver tissue. This damming effect increases pressure within the 
portal venous system and causes potential problems with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver function</a>. It is 
the onset of symptoms associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver disease</a> that might cause the health 
care professional to look for the presence of portal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_portal_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Portal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> occurs when there is an obstruction of blood flow through 
the liver and pressure rises within the portal vein. This obstruction can be 
intrahepatic (intra=within +hepatic=liver), pre-hepatic (pre=before) or post- 
hepatic (post=after).</p>.<p>Intrahepatic causes of portal hypertension include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cirrhosis</a> and hepatic 
fibrosis or scarring. A wide variety of illnesses are implicated as the cause of 
portal hypertension. Examples 
include the following:</p>.<p>Post-hepatic causes are due to obstruction of blood flow from the liver to 
the heart and can include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_portal_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When blood cannot easily flow through the liver architecture (from portal vein to sinusoids to hepatic vein to Vena cava), it tries to bypass the portal system, using the systemic venous system to return to the heart. Symptoms of portal hypertension are due to the complications of decreased blood flow through the liver, and from increased pressure within the veins where blood is shunted.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_the_diagnosis_of_portal_hypertension_made" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Portal hypertension usually is diagnosed well after the process has begun in the body, and only after a complication occurs. When a patient developsÂ <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascites/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ascites</a> or has gastrointestinal bleeding, the health care professional will look for potential causes, including portal hypertension.</p>.<p>Once the diagnosis is a possibility, it can be confirmed by blood tests, X-rays, CT or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">endoscopy</a>. Pressures within the portal vein are not routinely measured except in specific situations (see TIPS procedure)</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_portal_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for portal hypertension is often directed at preventing complications. This includes treating the underlying cause and avoidance of alcohol. Because of the risk of further liver damage, over-the-counter medications that contain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>, Panadol, etc.) should also be avoided.</p>.<p>Dietary restrictions include limiting salt to prevent further ascites fluid accumulation. Protein restriction may also be indicated, since increased protein load can overwhelm the liver's ability to synthesize it and may lead to hepatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalopathy</a>.</p>.<p>Medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta blockers</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitroglycerin</a> may be appropriate to decrease pressure within the portal system. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactulose-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lactulose</a> may be prescribed as a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.</p>.<p>Endoscopy may be required to band or tie off varices in the esophagus to prevent catastrophic and life threatening bleeding.</p>.<p>A TIPS procedure (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/transjugular_intrahepatic_portosystemic_shunt/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</a>) may be an option to decrease the pressure within the portal system. An interventional radiologist attempts to place a tube that connects the portal vein with the hepatic vein. This may decrease the pressure within the liver and may also reduce pressure within the veins of the stomach and esophagus, hopefully decreasing the risk of bleeding.</p>.<p>If portal hypertension and liver dysfunction become bad enough, liver transplantation may be necessary.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_portal_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The complications of portal hypertension are the complications of liver 
failure. These include gastrointestinal bleeding from varices, ascites and 
hepatic encephalopathy. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Splenomegaly</a> can also cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> , low white blood 
cell counts, and low platelet counts.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_portal_hypertension_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some liver diseases due to inborn errors of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metabolism_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a> like copper and iron 
cannot be prevented. The same can be said with congenital anatomy problems. 
However, when liver disease is due to alcohol and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drug abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> is a 
real possibility. 
Chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alcoholism</a> can lead to cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension. IV drug abuse can be the cause of 

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hepatitis_b_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis B</a> and C, resulting in 
cirrhosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_portal_hypertension" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Portal hypertension is a complication of an underlying liver disease. It is a 
disease that can be controlled but requires patients to be compliant with 
dietary restrictions and to abstain from alcohol and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>. Survival rates can 
be quite high as long as some liver function is maintained. The worse the liver 
function, the worse the prognosis <span id="cntid"></span></p>
