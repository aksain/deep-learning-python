Other symptoms are:Â </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_ramsay_hunt_syndrome_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Diagnosis of the syndrome is most often made by observing the symptoms described above (red painful rash with ear and or mouth blisters and one-sided facial paralysis). Also, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">PCR</a> test (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">polymerase chain reaction</a>) can be performed on the fluid from the blisters to demonstrate the viral genetic material, but this test is not done routinely.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_ramsay_hunt_syndrome_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The syndrome is not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contagious</a>; however, the herpes zoster virus that can be found in the blisters of Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be transmitted to other people and cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/varicella_chicken_pox_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chickenpox</a> in those who are unvaccinated against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chickenpox</a> and who have never had chickenpox. Individuals with Ramsay Hunt syndrome should avoid contact with newborns, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> women, immunodepressed individuals, and people with no history of chickenpox, at least until all the blisters change to scabs.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_ramsay_hunt_syndrome_compare_with_bells_palsy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bell's palsy also is a result of injury to the facial nerve by a viral infection, but the suspected viral cause of Bell's palsy has not been identified. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Varicella</a> virus (Herpes zoster) that also causes chickenpox and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shingles</a> (a painful, blister-producing Herpes zoster reinfection that usually occurs on one side of the body). There is no red rash associated with Bell's palsy as there is with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Additionally, Ramsay Hunt syndrome is commonly more painful than Bell's palsy. However, both can cause eyelid and mouth paralysis on one side of the face.</p>.<p>Dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclona is a rare degenerative disease of the nerves characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">epilepsy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">muscle spasms</a>, and gradually increasing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>. Like Bell's palsy, this disease complex mimics many symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Some investigators term the disease complex Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_ramsay_hunt_syndrome_treated_or_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment consists of antiviral agents (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acyclovir</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valacyclovir/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">valacyclovir</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famciclovir/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">famciclovir</a>) for about one week, steroids (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisone</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> medications. Best results are reported when treatment protocols are started within three days after symptoms appear. Early treatment usually results in a better prognosis (see below). For children, the varicella vaccine can reduce the chance of getting chickenpox from which the syndrome comes (reactivation of the virus). However, once a person gets chickenpox, the person is susceptible to reactivation of the virus and thus can develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_picture_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shingles</a> and/or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Fortunately, there is another vaccine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zoster_vaccine_live__shingles_vaccine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Zostavax</a>, which is helpful in preventing viral reactivation. Consequently, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shingles</a> and Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be either prevented or their symptoms reduced if the vaccine is administered. Usually, this vaccine is given to individuals that have had chickenpox as children and are now age 60 or older. The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prevention</a>) suggests the vaccine be routinely given to individuals aged 60 or older, as about 90% of the population has been exposed to chickenpox and about 20% of people that had chickenpox are likely to get <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/shingles_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shingles</a> without the vaccine.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_outlook_prognosis_for_patients_with_ramsay_hunt_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not as good as that for Bell's palsy. There is good clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with steroids, pain medications, and antiviral agents (like acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir) improve recovery and lessen the extreme facial discomfort. However, infrequent complications can develop, such as synkinesis (inappropriate nerve responses such as blinking or tear formation while trying to talk), eye damage, or rarely, viral spread to other nerves causing many other problems (for example, pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a>). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/postherpetic_neuralgia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Postherpetic neuralgia</a> (pain due to nerve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fiber</a> damage by the virus) may also develop and persist for months to years.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_more_information_about_ramsay_hunt_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
