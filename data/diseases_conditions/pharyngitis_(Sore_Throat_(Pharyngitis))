Most sore throats are caused by infections, and under these circumstances a sore throat can be contagious, whether it is caused by a viral infection (the most common cause) or strep throat. To prevent spreading contagious infections that cause sore throats, preventative measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of the infection.</p>.<p>Most types of these infections are transmitted person-to-person via saliva or nasal secretions commonly spread in airborne respiratory droplets, or through direct contact with infected objects (for example, cups or utensils) and infected surfaces.

Because most cases of sore throats are associated with infections, your doctor may order tests to differentiate between a bacterial or viral infection. If your doctor suspects you have strep throat, usually, he or she will take a rapid strep test (swabbing the throat). It takes only minutes for the results, and usually can be obtained during an office visit. A throat culture may be sent to the lab for definitive evaluation of strep throat if the initial rapid strep test is negative. Usually, the results of the culture are available within 24 to 48 hours.</p>.<p>Usually, no further tests are needed, depending on the details of the medical history and the findings on a physical exam. Your doctor may need to order addditional tests to help determine the cause of the sore throat, for example:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_natural_home_remedies_relieve_sore_throat_pain_and_other_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Various home remedies help soothe throat pain and other symptoms of a sore throat.</p>.<p>If a sore throat is caused by infection, it is important to drink plenty of fluids and to rest in order to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a> and to allow the body to properly recover.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_otc_medications_help_relieve_throat_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Various over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help soothe a sore throat.
