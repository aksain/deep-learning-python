<p><b><a name="what_is_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most skin cancers are locally destructive cancerous (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a>) growth of the skin. They originate from the cells of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">epidermis</a>, the superficial layer of the skin. Unlike cutaneous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/malignant_melanoma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">malignant melanoma</a>, the vast majority of these sorts of skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasize</a>) and become life-threatening.</p>.<p>There are three major types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">skin cancer</a>: (1) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/basal_cell_carcinoma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">basal cell carcinoma</a> (the most common), (2) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/squamous_cell_carcinoma_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">squamous cell carcinoma</a> (the second most common), which originate from skin cells, and (3) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">melanoma</a>, which originates from the pigment-producing skin cells (melanocytes) but is less common, though more dangerous, than the first two varieties. Other rare forms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_melanoma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">skin cancer</a> include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/non-hodgkins_lymphomas/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lymphomas</a>, Merkel cell cancers, and cancers of other tissue in the skin, including sarcomas as well as hair and sweat gland tumors. In this article, we will only be reviewing the most common forms of cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common risk factors for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/skin_cancer_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">skin cancer</a> are as follows.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_skin_cancer_hereditary" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since most skin cancers are caused by ultraviolet light exposure, skin cancers are generally not considered to be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>. But the fact that skin cancer is much more common among poorly pigmented individuals and that skin color is inherited does support the proposition that genetics are very important. There are some very rare genetic syndromes that result in an increased number of skin cancers in those affected.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Except in rare instances, most skin cancers arise from DNA mutations induced by ultraviolet light affecting cells of the epidermis. Many of these early cancers seem to be controlled by natural immune surveillance, which when compromised, may permit the development of masses of malignant cells that begin to grow into tumors.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several different types of skin cancers:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most basal cell carcinomas have few if any symptoms. Squamous cell carcinomas may be painful. Both forms of skin cancer may appear as a sore that bleeds, oozes, crusts, or otherwise will not heal. They begin as a slowly growing bump on the skin that may bleed after minor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>. Both kinds of skin cancers may have raised edges and a central ulceration.</p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of basal cell carcinomas include:</p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of squamous cell carcinomas include:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/actinic_keratosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Actinic keratoses</a> (AK), also called solar keratoses, are scaly, crusty lesions caused by damage from ultraviolet light, often in the facial area, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">scalp</a>, and backs of the hands. These are considered precancers because if untreated, up to 10% of actinic keratoses may develop into squamous cell carcinomas.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_is_a_mole_dangerous_or_high_risk_for_becoming_a_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/moles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Moles</a> are almost always harmless and only very rarely turn into skin cancer. If a mole becomes cancerous, it would be a melanoma. There is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">precancerous</a> stage, called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/dysplastic_nevus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">dysplastic nevus</a>, which is somewhat more irregular than a normal mole. An early sign of melanoma is noticing a difference in a mole: asymmetry, irregular border, color changes, increasing diameter, or other evolving changes may signify a mole is melanoma. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/moles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Moles</a> never become squamous cell carcinomas or basal cell carcinomas.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_most_common_sites_where_skin_cancer_develops" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Skin cancers typically arise in areas of the skin exposed to the sun repeatedly over many years such as on the face and nose, ears, back of the neck, and the bald area of the scalp. Less commonly, these tumors may appear at sites with only limited sun exposure such as the back, chest, or the extremities. However, skin cancer may occur anywhere on the skin.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A skin examination by a dermatologist is the way to get a definitive diagnosis of skin cancer. In many cases, the appearance alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis.</p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">skin biopsy</a> is usually used to confirm a suspicion of skin cancer. This is performed by numbing the area under the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> with a local anesthetic such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">lidocaine</a>. A small portion of the tumor is sliced away and sent for examination by a pathologist, who looks at the tissue under a microscope and renders a diagnosis based on the characteristics of the tumor.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_staging_for_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no specific staging system for basal cell carcinoma. If the tumor is wider than 2 cm (about Â¾ inch diameter), it is probably a more serious tumor. Basal cell carcinomas of the ears, nose, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> may also be of more concern, regardless of the size.</p>.<p>There is a staging system for squamous cell carcinoma. Large tumors that are thicker than 2 mm, invade the nerve structures of the skin, occur on the ear, and have certain worrisome characteristics under the microscope are of more concern. If the tumor metastasizes to a site at some distance from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>, the cancer is likely to be a dangerous tumor.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several effective means of treating skin cancer. The choice of therapy depends on the location and size of the tumor, the microscopic characteristics of the cancer, and the general health of the patient.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kinds_of_doctors_treat_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The main type of doctor who will treat skin cancer is a dermatologist. Your primary care physician or internist may first notice a sign of skin cancer, but will refer you to a dermatologist for further testing and treatment. You may also see an oncologist, which is a cancer specialist.</p>.<p>If you have surgical removal of a tumor, depending on how much skin is removed, you may see a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> or reconstructive surgeon after the tumor removal to help restore the appearance of the skin, especially on the face.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_%0Aand_survival_rate_for_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">nonmelanoma skin cancer</a> is generally excellent. Both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are highly curable. There are virtually no deaths from basal cell carcinoma and only rare deaths with squamous cell carcinoma skin cancers, mostly in immunosuppressed individuals. Depending on the method of treatment and the location and type of skin cancer, the likelihood of a recurrence of a previously treated skin cancer is as low as 1% to 2% for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mohs_surgery/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Mohs surgery</a> and up to 10% to 15% for destruction by electrodessication and curettage.</p>.<p>Early detection of skin cancers can lead to better outcomes. Know your skin and if you have any moles or spots that are suspect, see a dermatologist for a skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_detection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">cancer screening</a>. Awareness is key in identifying and treating skin cancers early.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_skin_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many skin cancers can be prevented by avoiding triggers that cause tumors to develop. Prevention strategies include protection from the sun by the use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during the peak hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Parents should ensure children are protected from the sun. Do not use tanning beds, which are a major cause of excess ultraviolet light exposure and a significant risk factor for skin cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) has noted a dramatic rise in the numbers and cost of skin cancer. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the total number of skin cancers and that new breakthrough treatments for melanoma, although expensive, comprise only a small portion of the total cost of skin cancer treatment. Most skin cancers are treated cost efficiently by dermatologists in an office setting.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="sunscreen_use_and_vitamin_d" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A major source of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin D</a> comes from sunlight exposure, which leads to the production of the vitamin in the skin. Some argue sunscreens block out so much of the sun's rays that inadequate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutritional_health_vitamin_d_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">vitamin D</a> synthesis results. In fact, very few people actually apply <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunscreen</a> to every inch of their exposed skin, so <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">vitamin D</a> synthesis does occur. There is no reason not to use sunscreens because of a fear of low vitamin D. If there is a concern, vitamin D can be obtained by eating leafy vegetables or taking an oral multivitamin supplement.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
