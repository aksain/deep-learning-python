<p>Liver disease is any disturbance of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver function</a> that causes illness. The liver is responsible for many critical functions within the body and should it become diseased or injured, the loss of those functions can cause significant damage to the body. Liver disease is also referred to as hepatic disease.</p>.<p>Liver disease is a broad term that covers all the potential problems that cause the liver to fail to perform its designated functions. Usually, more than 75% or three quarters of liver tissue needs to be affected before a decrease in function occurs.</p>.<p>The liver is the largest solid organ in the body; and is also considered a gland because among its many functions, it makes and secretes bile. The liver is located in the upper right portion of the abdomen protected by the rib cage. It has two main lobes that are made up of tiny lobules. The liver cells have two different sources of blood supply. The hepatic artery supplies oxygen rich blood that is pumped from the heart, while the portal vein supplies nutrients from the intestine and the spleen.</p>.<p>Normally, veins return blood from the body to the heart, but the portal vein allows nutrients and chemicals from the digestive tract to enter the liver for processing and filtering prior to entering the general circulation. The portal vein also efficiently delivers the chemicals and proteins that liver cells need to produce the proteins, cholesterol, and glycogen required for normal body activities.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>As part of its function, the liver makes bile, a fluid that contains among other substances, water, chemicals, and bile acids (made from stored cholesterol in the liver). Bile is stored in the gallbladder and when food enters the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), bile is secreted into the duodenum, to aid in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a> of food.</p>.<p>The liver is the only organ in the body that can easily replace damaged cells, but if enough cells are lost, the liver may not be able to meet the needs of the body.</p>.<p>The liver can be considered a factory; and among its many functions include:</p>.<p>Cirrhosis is a term that describes permanent scarring of the liver. In cirrhosis, the normal liver cells are replaced by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar tissue</a> that cannot perform any liver function.</p>.<p>Acute liver failure may or may not be reversible, meaning that on occasion, there is a treatable cause and the liver may be able to recover and resume its normal functions.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The liver can be damaged in a variety of ways. </p>.<p><strong><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_health_risks_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alcohol abuse</a></strong></p>.<p>Alcohol abuse is the most common cause of liver disease in North America. Alcohol is directly toxic to liver cells and can cause liver inflammation, referred to as alcoholic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hepatitis</a>. In chronic alcohol abuse, fat accumulation occurs in liver cells affecting their ability to function. </p>.<p><strong>Cirrhosis</strong></p>.<p>Cirrhosis is a late-stage of liver disease. Scarring of the liver and loss of functioning liver cells cause the liver to fail. Significant amounts of liver cells need to be damaged before the hole organ fails to function. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p></p>.<p>Liver cells may become temporarily inflamed or permanently damaged by exposure to medications or drugs. Some medications or drugs require an overdose to cause liver injury while others may cause the damage even when taken in the appropriately prescribed dosage.</p>.<p>Taking excess amounts of acetaminophen (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>, Panadol) can cause liver failure. This is the reason that warning labels exist on many over-the-counter medications that contain acetaminophen and why prescription <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prescription_drug_abuse_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">narcotic</a>-acetaminophen combination medications (for example, Vicodin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocodoneacetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lortab</a>, Norco, Tylenol #3) limit the numbers of tablets to be taken in a day. For patients with underlying liver disease or those who abuse alcohol, that daily limit is lower and acetaminophen may be contra-indicated in those individuals.</p>.<p>Statins are drugs commonly prescribed to control elevated blood levels of cholesterol. Even when taken in the appropriately prescribed dose, liver inflammation may occur. This inflammation can be detected by blood tests that measure liver enzymes. Stopping the medication usually results in return of the liver function to normal.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/niacin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Niacin</a> is another medication used to control elevated blood levels of cholesterol, but liver inflammation with this medication is related to the dose taken. Similarly, patients with underlying liver disease may be at higher risk of developing liver disease due to medications such as niacin. Recent studies have found that niacin may not be as effective as previously thought in controlling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_frequently_asked_questions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high cholesterol</a>. Patients who take niacin may want to see their health care professional to determine if other treatment options may be appropriate.</p>.<p>There are numerous other medications that may cause liver inflammation, most of which will resolve when the medication is stopped.

If bile flow is obstructed, it can cause inflammation within the liver. Most commonly, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gallstones/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gallstones</a> can cause an obstruction of the ducts that drains bile from the liver.</p>.<p>Abnormalities of the opening of the bile duct into the small intestine (sphincter of Oddi) can lead to abnormalities of bile flow. The sphincter of Oddi acts as a "valve" that allows bile to flow from the common bile duct into the intestine.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/primary_biliary_cirrhosis_pbc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Primary biliary </a><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/primary_biliary_cirrhosis_pbc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">c</a>holangitis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_psc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a> can lead to progressive scarring of the bile ducts, causing them to become narrow, which results in reduced bile flow through the liver. Eventually, damage and scarring of the liver architecture occurs resulting in liver failure.</p>.<p><strong>Other diseases and conditions</strong></p>.<p>Since the liver is responsible for the functions that affect so many other organs in the body, liver disease and failure may cause complications. Examples include:</p>.<p>Classic symptoms of liver disease include:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Fatigue</a>, weakness and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">weight loss</a> may also occur.</p>.<p>However, since there are a variety of liver diseases, the symptoms tend to be specific for that illness until late-stage liver disease and liver failure occurs.</p>.<p>Examples of liver disease symptoms due to certain conditions or diseases include:</p>.<p>Additionally, there is increased pressure within the cirrhotic liver affecting blood flow through the liver. Increased pressure in the portal vein causes blood flow to the liver to slow down and blood vessels to swell. Swollen veins (varices) form around the stomach and esophagus and are at risk for bleeding.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Often, the onset of a liver disease is gradual and there is no specific symptom that brings the affected individual to seek medical care. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Fatigue</a>, weakness and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weight loss</a> that cannot be explained should prompt a visit for medical evaluation.</p>.<p>Jaundice or yellow skin is never normal and should prompt an evaluation by a health-care professional.</p>.<p>Persistent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a>, vomiting, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">abdominal pain</a> should also prompt medical evaluation as soon as possible.</p>.<p>Acetaminophen or Tylenol overdose, whether accidental or intentional, can cause acute liver failure. Emergent evaluation and treatment is required. Antidotes to protect the liver can be provided, but are effective only when used within a few hours. Without this intervention, acetaminophen overdose can lead to liver failure. Symptoms only occur after potential liver damage has occurred.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>The precise diagnosis of liver disease involves a history and physical examination performed by a health care professional. Understanding the symptoms and the patient's risk factors for liver disease will help guide any diagnostic tests that may be considered.</p>.<p>Sometimes history is difficult, especially in patients who abuse alcohol. These patients tend to minimize their consumption, and it is often family members who are able to provide the correct information.</p>.<p>Liver disease can have physical findings that affect almost all body systems including the heart, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>, abdomen, skin, brain and cognitive function, and other parts of the nervous system. The physical examination often requires evaluation of the entire body.</p>.<p>Blood tests are helpful in assessing liver inflammation and function. </p>.<p>Specific liver function blood tests include:</p>.<p>Other blood tests may be considered, including the following:</p>.<p>Imaging studies may be used to visualize, not only the liver, but other nearby organs that may be diseased. Examples of imaging studies include:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_biopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Liver biopsy</a> may be considered to confirm a specific diagnosis of liver disease. Under local anesthetic, a long thin needle is inserted through the chest wall into the liver, where a small sample of liver tissue is obtained for examination under a microscope. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Each liver disease will have its own specific treatment regimen. For example, hepatitis A requires supportive care to maintain hydration while the body's immune system fights and resolves the infection. Patients with gallstones may require surgery to remove the gallbladder. Other diseases may need long-term medical care to control and minimize the consequences of their disease</p>.<p>In patients with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, medications may be required to control the amount of protein absorbed in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>. The liver affected by cirrhosis may not be able to metabolize the waste products, resulting in elevated blood ammonia levels and hepatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">encephalopathy</a> (lethargy, confusion, coma). Low sodium diet and water pills (diuretics) may be required to minimize water retention.</p>.<p>In those patients with large amounts of ascites fluid (fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavity), the excess fluid may have to be occasionally removed with a needle and syringe (paracentesis). Using local anesthetic, a needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and the fluid is withdrawn. The ascites fluid can spontaneously become infected and paracentesis also may be used as a diagnostic test looking for infection.</p>.<p>Operations may be required to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/portal_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">portal hypertension</a> and minimize the risk of bleeding.</p>.<p>Liver transplantation is the final option for patients whose livers have failed.</p>.<p>Except for gallstone disease and some viral infections such as hepatitis A, C, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/infectious_mononucleosis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">infectious mononucleosis</a>, most liver diseases are managed and not cured.</p>.<p>Liver disease can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.
