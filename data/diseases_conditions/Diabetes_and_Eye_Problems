In fact, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> is the leading cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a> in adults age 20 to 74.

If you have eye problems and diabetes, don't buy a new pair of glasses as soon as you notice you have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blurred_vision/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blurred vision</a>. It could just be a temporary eye problem that develops rapidly with diabetes and is caused by high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reasons_for_blood_sugar_swings_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood sugar</a> levels.
</p>.<p>
High blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sugar</a> in diabetes causes the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lens</a> of the eye to swell, which changes your ability to see. To correct this kind of eye problem, you need to get your blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sugar</a> back into the target range (90-130 milligrams per deciliter or mg/dL before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL one to two hours after a meal). It may take as long as three months after your blood sugar is well controlled for your vision to fully get back to normal.
</p>.<p>
Blurred vision can also be a symptom of more serious eye problem with diabetes. The three major eye problems that people with diabetes may develop and should be aware of are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataracts</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glaucoma</a>, and retinopathy.</p>.<p><b><a name="cataracts_and_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataract</a> is a clouding or fogging of the normally clear lens of the eye. The lens is what allows us to see and focus on an image just like a camera. Although anyone can get <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataracts</a>, people with diabetes get these eye problems at an earlier age than most and the condition progresses more rapidly than in people without diabetes.
</p>.<p>
If you have a cataract, there is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye that results in the inability to focus light, and your vision is impaired. Symptoms of this eye problem in diabetes include blurred or glared vision.
</p>.<p>
During <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataract_surgery/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataract surgery</a>, the cloudy lens is removed or cleaned out and replaced by a clear man-made lens.  </p>.<p>

</p>.<p><b><a name="glaucoma_and_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When fluid inside the eye does not drain properly from a buildup of pressure inside the eye, it results in another eye problem with diabetes called 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/glaucoma_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glaucoma</a>. The pressure damages nerves and the vessels in the eye, causing changes in vision.
</p>.<p>
Treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">open-angle glaucoma</a> -- the most common form of glaucoma -- requires lowering the eye's pressure by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor or decreasing the production of the fluid. Medications can accomplish both of these goals. 
</p>.<p>
With open-angle glaucoma, there may be no symptoms of this eye problem at all until the disease is very advanced and there is significant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vision loss</a>. In the less common form of this eye problem, symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>, eye <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aches</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, blurred vision, watering eyes, halos around lights, and loss of vision.
</p>.<p>
Treatment of this eye problem in diabetes can include special eye drops, laser procedures, medicine, or surgery. Surgery and laser treatments are directed at improving the eye's aqueous drainage. You can prevent serious eye problems in diabetes problems by getting an annual glaucoma screening from your eye doctor.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG-->
</p>.<p><b><a name="diabetic_retinopathy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">retina</a> is a group of specialized cells that convert light as it enters though the lens into images. The eye nerve or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">optic nerve</a> transmits visual information to the brain.
</p>.<p>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/diabetic_retinopathy_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diabetic retinopathy</a> is one of the vascular (blood-vessel related) complications related to diabetes. This diabetes eye problem is due to damage of small vessels and is called a "microvascular complication." 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Kidney disease</a> and nerve damage due to diabetes are also microvascular complications. Large blood vessel damage (also called macrovascular complications) includes complications like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>.
</p>.<p>
The microvascular complications have, in numerous studies, been shown to be related to high blood sugar levels. You can reduce your risk of these eye problems in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/avoid_diabetes_complications_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes complications</a> by improving your blood sugar control.
</p>.<p>
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized nations. The duration of diabetes is the single most important risk for developing retinopathy. So the longer you have diabetes, the greater the risk of this very serious eye problem. If retinopathy is not found early or is not treated, it can lead to blindness.
</p>.<p>
People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 1 diabetes</a> rarely develop retinopathy before <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">puberty</a>. In adults with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 1 diabetes</a>, it is also rare to see retinopathy before five years' duration of diabetes. The risks of retinal damage increase with progressive duration of diabetes. Intensive control of blood sugar levels will reduce your risks of developing retinopathy. The DCCT, a large study of people with type 1 diabetes showed that people with diabetes who achieved tight control of their blood sugars with either an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insulin pump</a> or multiple daily injections of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insulin</a> were 50%-75% less likely to develop retinopathy, nephropathy (kidney disease), or nerve damage (all microvascular complications).

</p>.<p>People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 2 diabetes</a> usually have signs of eye problems when diabetes is diagnosed. In this case, control of blood sugar, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a>, and 
blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a> with diabetes have an important role in slowing the progression of retinopathy and other eye problems.
</p>.<p>

Here, it is important to address the risks factors that can worsen the occluded vessels. 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Smoking cessation</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a> control, cholesterol management, and blood sugar control must take place in order to stop the progression of new vessels from forming into the orbit of the eye. These are fragile vessels that can bleed and eventually cause a clot to form in the orbit, which <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scars</a> and causes detachment of the retina. This eventually leads to irreversible vision loss.</p>.<p>

Treatment of diabetic retinopathy may involve laser procedures or surgery. In a study of people with diabetes with early retinopathy, laser therapy to burn the fragile vessel resulted in a 50% reduction of blindness.</p>.<p>

To prevent retinopathy with diabetes, have your eye doctor screen your eyes annually. Women with diabetes who later become <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> should have a comprehensive eye exam during the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">first trimester</a> and close follow-up with an eye doctor during the rest of their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> to avoid serious eye problems with diabetes. (This recommendation does not apply to women who develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gestational_diabetes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gestational diabetes</a>, since they are not at risk for retinopathy.)<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="preventing_eye_problems_with_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The American Diabetes Association offers these <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_care/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eye care</a> guidelines for people with diabetes to help prevent eye problems:
