With this disease, your immune system attacks the thyroid and causes it to make more <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">thyroid hormone</a> than your body needs. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Thyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body - even the way your heart beats.</p>.<p>If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstrual cycle</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">fertility</a>. During pregnancy, untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to health problems for the mother and baby. Graves' disease also can affect your eyes and skin.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--><!--END IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have Graves' disease, you may have common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of hyperthyroidism</a> such as</p>.<p>Rarely, people with Graves' disease develop a reddish thickening of the skin on the shins, a condition called pretibial myxedema or Graves' dermopathy. This skin problem is usually painless and mild, but it can be painful for some.</p>.<p>Graves' ophthalmopathy (Graves' orbitopathy) can cause retracted eyelids, meaning the eyelids are pulled back from the eye. Graves' orbitopathy can also cause bulging eyes, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/double_vision/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">double vision</a>, and swelling around the eyes.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Researchers aren't sure why some people develop autoimmune disorders such as Graves' disease. These disorders probably develop from a combination of genes and an outside trigger, such as a virus.</p>.<p>With Graves' disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to thyroid cells. TSI acts like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone made in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pituitary_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pituitary gland</a> that tells the thyroid how much thyroid hormone to make. TSI causes the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_graves_disease_a_problem_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Thyroid hormone levels that are just a little high are usually not a problem in pregnancy. However, more severe hyperthyroidism that isn't treated can affect both the mother and the baby. If you have Graves' disease, be sure your hyperthyroidism is under control before <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">becoming pregnant</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_graves_disease_is_it_common" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. The disease affects about 1 in 200 people.</p>.<p>Graves' disease usually affects people between ages 30 and 50, but can occur at any age. The disease is seven to eight times more common in women than men.3 A person’s chance of developing Graves’ disease increases if other family members have the disease.</p>.<p>People with other autoimmune disorders are more likely to develop Graves' disease than people without these disorders. Conditions linked with Graves' disease include</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your health care provider may suspect Graves' disease based on your symptoms and findings during a physical exam. One or more blood tests can confirm that you have hyperthyroidism and may point to Graves' disease as the cause.</p>.<p>Other clues that hyperthyroidism is caused by Graves' disease are</p>.<p>If the diagnosis is uncertain, your doctor may order further blood or imaging tests to confirm Graves' disease as the cause.</p>.<p><b><a name="foods_diet_to_avoid_if_you_have_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People with Graves' disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine - such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed - may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism. Taking iodine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a> can have the same effect.</p>.<p>Talk with your health care professional about what foods you should limit or avoid, and let him or her know if you take iodine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">supplements</a>. Also, share information about any <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=165214" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="itn">cough syrups</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multivitamins_includes_prenatal_vitamins-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">multivitamins</a> that you take because they may contain iodine.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_graves_disease_can_it_be_cured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You have three treatment options: medicine, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves' disease in the United States, but doctors are beginning to use medicine more often than in the past. Based on factors such as your age, whether you are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a>, or whether you have other medical conditions, your doctor may recommend a specific treatment and can help you decide which one is right for you.</p>.<p><b><a name="radioiodine_therapy_for_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For radioiodine therapy, you take radioactive iodine-131 (I-131) by mouth as a capsule or liquid. I-131, at a higher dose than the dose used for imaging tests, slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. The dose of I-131 usually used for radioiodine therapy does not affect other body tissues. You take radioactive iodine-131 as a capsule or liquid.</p>.<p>Although it's unlikely, you may need more than one radio-iodine treatment to bring your thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. In the meantime, treatment with medicines called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta blockers</a> can control your symptoms.</p>.<p>Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypothyroidism</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">underactive thyroid</a>, because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. However, hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. People with hypothyroidism can completely control the condition with daily thyroid hormone medicine.</p>.<p>Doctors don't use radioiodine therapy to treat pregnant women or women who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breastfeeding</a>. Radioactive iodine can harm the fetus' thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breast milk</a>.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="medications_for_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Beta blockers don't stop your thyroid from producing thyroid hormone but can reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. These medicines act quickly to relieve many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as trembling, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. Most people feel better within hours of taking beta blockers.</p>.<p>Antithyroid therapy is the simplest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medicines cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. These medicines usually don’t provide a permanent cure, but in some people, the effects last a long time after they stop taking the medicine. Doctors most often use the antithyroid medicine methimazole.</p>.<p>Doctors usually treat pregnant and breastfeeding women with antithyroid medicine, since this treatment may be safer for the baby than other treatments. Doctors use propylthiouracil more often than methimazole during the first 3 months of pregnancy because methimazole may harm the fetus, although this happens rarely. Also rarely, propylthiouracil may affect the fetus, but any effects are less harmful than having uncontrolled hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.</p>.<p>Once treatment with antithyroid medicine begins, your thyroid hormone levels may not move into the normal range for several weeks or months. The total average treatment time is about 12 to 18 months,7 but treatment can continue for many years in people who don’t want radioiodine or surgery to treat their Graves' disease.</p>.<p>Antithyroid medicines can cause side effects in some people, including</p>.<p>Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:</p>.<p><b><a name="surgery_for_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The least-used treatment for Graves' disease is surgery to remove the thyroid gland. Sometimes doctors use surgery to treat people with large goiters, or pregnant women who are allergic to or have side effects from antithyroid medicines.</p>.<p>Before surgery, your doctor will prescribe antithyroid medicines to bring your thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. This treatment prevents a condition called thyroid storm - a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms - that can occur when people with hyperthyroidism have general anesthesia.</p>.<p>After surgery to remove your thyroid, you will develop hypothyroidism and need to take thyroid hormone medicine every day for life. After surgery, your doctor will continue to check your thyroid hormone levels and adjust your dose as needed.</p>.<p><b><a name="serious_health_problems_death_caused_by_untreated_graves_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Without treatment, Graves' disease can cause some serious and potentially fatal health problems, including:</p>
