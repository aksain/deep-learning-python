There are many different methods of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth control</a>; some types also protect against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sexually transmitted diseases</a>.

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexually_transmitted_diseases_stds_in_women/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">STDs</a>.</p>.<p>There are two types of condoms, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">male condom</a> and the female <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">condom</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="male" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The male condom, or "rubber," is a thin covering made of latex, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a>, or animal membrane that is rolled over an erect penis. The covering prevents semen, the fluid that contains sperm, from entering a woman's vagina.</p>.<p><b><a name="made" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most condoms are made of a type of rubber called "latex." Latex condoms are the most effective condom at preventing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">STDs</a>. Recently, condoms made of polyurethane (a type of plastic) have become available. These are more expensive than latex condoms and seem to break more easily. They are mainly useful for people who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> to latex. There are also "natural" condoms, which are made of animal membranes (lambskin). These are expensive and although they are effective at preventing pregnancy they do not decrease the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.</p>.<p><b><a name="latex" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Condoms come in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Here are some characteristics to consider when buying condoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="man" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Take caution when opening the wrapper to avoid tearing the condom with your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a>, fingernails or rings. Gently pinch the air out of the tip of the condom before putting it on. The condom is rolled over the erect penis before sexual activity begins. If the condom does not have a built-in nipple, leave about 1/2-inch of the condom free at the tip of the penis so that semen has a place to collect.</p>.<p>A new condom must be used each time you have sex. The condom must be in place before the penis gets near the vagina. If you use lubricants with a condom, be sure to only use water-based lubricants, such as K-Y Jelly. Oil-based lubricants, such as Vaseline, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/massage_therapy/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">massage</a> oils and body lotions can cause condoms to leak or break. Certain vaginal medications used to treat yeast infections can also weaken condoms.</p>.<p>Initially it was felt that condoms lubricated with spermicidal agents offered more protection against STDs. Newer studies show that frequent use of condoms containing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barrier_methods_of_birth_control/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">spermicides</a> offers no additional protection and it may actually increase the risk of a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm"&gt;<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a> and other STDs by irritating the vagina and penis.

Condoms also are sold in some vending machines in public restrooms.</p>.<p><b><a name="preventing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Condoms are about 85 % effective. With careful use, they are even more effective. Keep in mind that the best way to avoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trying_to_conceive/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">getting pregnant</a> is to not have sex (abstinence).</p>.<p><b><a name="stds" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Latex condoms provide protection from sexually transmitted diseases by preventing the infected area from coming into contact with the partner. Polyurethane condoms provide some protection, although not as much as latex. Natural or lambskin condoms do not protect against STDs because they have larger holes or "pores" that allow the small particles that can cause some STDs to pass through.</p>.<p><b><a name="foam" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Contraceptive</a> foam can offer added protection against pregnancy in case a condom breaks. Frequent use of spermicides can irritate the genital tissues and may increase the risk of STDs, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV/AIDS</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="effective" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When used together and properly, foam and condoms are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="female" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The female condom is a lubricated polyurethane (plastic) tube that has a flexible ring at each end. One end of the tube is closed.</p>.<p><b><a name="used" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before sexual activity begins, the woman inserts the condom into her vagina so that the closed end of the tube covers the cervix, and the other end slightly covers the labia (lips on the outside of the vagina). The condom blocks sperm from entering the womb. Female condoms should be discarded after one use.</p>.<p><b><a name="fcondom" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Like the male condom, the female condom is available at drug stores without a prescription.</p>.<p><b><a name="pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The female condom is about 75% effective.</p>.<p><b><a name="femalestds" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Female condoms provide some protection against sexually transmitted diseases, but the male condom provides the best protection if you have sex. Female condoms should not be used in combination with male condoms. The friction of the two could result in product failure.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>
