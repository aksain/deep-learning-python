Most children will not have a fully retractable foreskin at birth, but do so as they get older with the majority having a fully retractable foreskin by early adolescence.</p>.<p>Pathologic phimosis is caused by scarring, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/balanitis_penis_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">balanitis</a>, and underlying medical risk factors.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_phimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The inability of the foreskin to retract can lead to difficulty cleaning of the area which can cause balanitis. Other symptoms include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_tell_if_i_have_phimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor can diagnose phimosis based on a thorough history and physical examination.

This treatment has shown a success rate of over 70%. The ointment softens the foreskin and is applied for 4 to 6 weeks. Once full retraction is possible the ointment is discontinued.</p>.<p>If the steroid treatment is not successful, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/circumcision_the_medical_pros_and_cons/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">circumcision</a> might be beneficial.

Additional tests are usually not necessary.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_and_cure_for_paraphimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Manual reduction is usually the first treatment option. To help with the pain, your doctor other health care professional might apply a local anesthetic cream, give you pain medication by mouth, or apply a local anesthetic block to your penis. Applying ice to the local area can help with the edema during manual reduction.</p>.<p>Local injection of hyaluronidase is effective in decreasing the swelling and allowing reduction.</p>.<p>If none of these techniques are successful or if the doctor feels a faster reduction is necessary, a small surgical slit can be made in the back side (dorsal region) of the constrictive skin. This should usually be followed by a circumcision at a later date to avoid a recurrence.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_circumcision_prevent_these_penis_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Circumcision can prevent paraphimosis and phimosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_if_ive_had_either_of_these_penis_conditions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
