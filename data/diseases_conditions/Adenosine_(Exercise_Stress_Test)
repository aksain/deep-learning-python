Ask your doctor about any specific instructions.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_should_i_prepare_for_the_exercise_stress_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_i_have_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_wear_the_day_of_the_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>On the day of your stress test, wear soft-soled shoes suitable for walking and comfortable clothes. Do not bring valuables.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_the_exercise_stress_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>First, during a stress test, a technician will gently clean 10 small areas on your chest and place electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph monitor (ECG or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">EKG</a>) that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test.</p>.<p>Before you start exercising, the technician will perform an EKG, to measure your heart rate at rest and will take your blood pressure.</p>.<p>You will begin to exercise by walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. The rate of exercise, or degree of difficulty will gradually increase. You will be asked to exercise until you feel exhausted.</p>.<p>At regular intervals, the lab personnel will ask how you are feeling. Please tell them if you feel chest, arm or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jaw_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">jaw pain</a> or discomfort, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or any other unusual symptoms. It is normal for your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sweating_perspiration_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">perspiration</a> to increase during the test. The lab personnel will watch for any symptoms or changes on the ECG monitor that suggest the test should be stopped.</p>.<p>After the test you will walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will continue to be monitored until the levels begin returning to normal.</p>.<p>Although the appointment lasts about 60 minutes, the actual exercise time is usually between seven and 12 minutes.</p>.<p>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the exercise stress test.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
