<p>Blood flows through blood vessels (arteries and veins), and is constantly in motion as the heart pumps blood through arteries to the different areas (organs, glands, cells etc.) of the body. Blood is then returned back to the heart by the veins. Blood returns to the heart by the motion of the body. Muscles squeeze blood through the veins back toward the heart. Without motion, blood has a tendency to stagnate by gravity, and stagnant blood has the tendency to clot.</p>.<p>Blood clotting is an important mechanism to help the body repair injured blood vessels. Blood consists of:</p>.<p>Complex mechanisms exist in the bloodstream to form clots where they are needed. If the lining of the blood vessels becomes damaged, platelets are recruited to the injured area to form an initial plug. These activated platelets release chemicals that start a clotting cascade, using a series of clotting factors produced by the body. Ultimately, fibrin is formed, a protein that crosslinks with itself to form a mesh that makes up the final blood clot.</p>.<p>The medical term for a blood clot is a thrombus (plural = thrombi). When a thrombus is formed as part of a normal repair process of the body, there is little consequence. When a thrombus (blood clot) forms when it is not needed, it can have significant consequences.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Blood clots form when there is damage to the lining of a blood vessel, either an artery or a vein. The damage may be obvious, such as a cut or laceration, or may not be visible to the naked eye. Blood also will begin to clot if it stops moving and becomes stagnant, or in diseases that cause the blood to clot abnormally.</p>.<p>Blood clots in a vein (venous thrombosis) occur when a person becomes immobilized and muscles are not contracting to push blood back to the heart. This stagnant blood begins to form small clots along the walls of the vein. This initial clot can gradually grow to partially or completely block (occlude) the vein and prevent blood from returning to the heart.</p>.<p>Blood clots in an artery (arterial thrombi) occur by a different mechanism. For those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atherosclerotic</a> disease, plaque deposits form along the lining of the artery and grow, which causes the vessel to narrow. This disease process may cause:</p>.<p>If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form at the site of that rupture and can completely or partially block the blood flow at that point.</p>.<p><strong>Blood clots in the heart:</strong> In <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_fibrillation_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atrial fibrillation</a>, the upper chamber (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_fibrillation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atrium</a>) of the heart does not beat in an organized manner. Instead, it jiggles, and blood tends to become stagnant along the walls of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_flutter/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atrium</a>. Over time this may cause small blood clots to form. Clots also can form in the ventricle after a heart attack when part of the heart muscle is injured and unable to contract normally. Since the damaged area doesn't contract with the rest of the heart, blood can start to pool or stagnate, leading to clot formation.</p>.<p><strong>Blood leaking out of a blood vessel:</strong> Blood clots can form when blood leaks out of a blood vessel, and this process can be very beneficial because the clot helps stop further bleeding at the site of injury. A few examples of how bleeding is controlled by the body's clotting mechanism are</p>.<p><strong>Blood clots causing other medical problems:</strong> Sometimes, normal blood clotting can cause medical problems because of its location. For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_urine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood in the urine</a> may occur from any of a variety of reasons (such as infection, trauma, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a>/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>), and clots may form over the urethra, the tube that empties the bladder, preventing the bladder from emptying, causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_retention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary retention</a>.</p>.<p>Clot formation in the uterus may cause pain when the clots are passed through the cervix and can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vaginal bleeding</a>, either as part of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstruation</a> or as abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vaginal bleeding</a> (menorrhagia, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dysmenorrhea</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Blood clots in the veins do not allow blood to return to the heart, and symptoms occur because of this "damming effect." These clots often occur in the legs or the arms, symptoms include:</p>.<p>Most often, only one leg or arm is affected and the swelling occurs over the course of many hours. Because the leg or arm becomes red, warm, and swollen, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether the cause is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_dvt_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">DVT</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_dvt_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">deep vein thrombosis</a>) or an infection.</p>.<p>On occasion, the whole leg may become very swollen, painful and turn bluish in color due to a blood clot located in the femoral vein in the upper leg or the iliac vein in the pelvis. This is called phlegmasia cerulia dolens. A similar situation may occur in the arm if the blood clot affects the subclavian vein located in the chest.</p>.<p>Blood clots in the arteries do not allow blood to pump to an affected area. Body tissue that is deprived of blood and oxygen begins to die and becomes ischemic. Symptoms of blood clots in the arteries depend upon the location of the clot. Arterial blood clots cause diseases and illnesses that are medical emergencies or call 911.</p>.<p><b>Heart attack: </b>Blood clots in the coronary arteries of the heart cause a heart attack.

With pulmonary embolus (pulmonary embolism), two issues occur.</p>.<p>Even if venous blood clots do not embolize, they may cause significant local problems with swelling and pain.

If one of these clots break off, it may embolize, or travel in the bloodstream to the brain, blocking an artery and causing a stroke. Other arteries also may be involved when blood clots caused by the presence of AFib dislodge to stop blood flow (embolize), including those that supply blood to the bowel. This can cause bowel ischemia and tissue death (potential necrosis) of the intestine. Clots also can affect blood supply to the extremities (arms, fingers, and toes).</p>.<p>Blood should clot anytime it becomes stagnant. This also means clots will form when blood leaks out of blood vessels.</p>.<p>Examples include:</p>.<p>The first step in making the diagnosis of a blood clot is talking to the patient and family to understand the situation. The location of the blood clot and its effect on blood flow is what causes symptoms and signs. If a blood clot or thrombus is a consideration, the history may explore risk factors or situations that might put the patient at risk for forming a clot.</p>.<p>Venous blood clots often develop slowly with a gradual onset of swelling, pain, and discoloration. Symptoms of a venous thrombus will often progress over hours.</p>.<p>Arterial thrombi occur as an acute (sudden onset) event. Tissues need oxygen immediately, and the loss of blood supply creates a situation in which symptoms begin immediately.</p>.<p>Arterial thrombi occur as an acute event. Tissues need oxygen immediately, and the loss of blood supply creates a situation in which symptoms begin immediately.</p>.<p>There may be symptoms that precede the acute artery blockage that may be warning signs of the potential future complete occlusion of the blood vessel.</p>.<p>Physical examination can assist in providing additional information that may increase the suspicion for a blood clot.</p>.<p>Arterial thrombus is also the cause of heart attack and stroke (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cerebrovascular accident</a>) and their associated symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b>If a blood clot travels to the lung, this is a medical emergency. </b>There are varieties of tests to look for pulmonary emboli. A plain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a> will not show blood clots, but the X-ray may be done to look for other conditions that can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, which are the most common symptoms of a pulmonary embolus. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrocardiogram</a> (EKG) may show abnormalities suggestive of a pulmonary embolus and may reveal other causes of chest pain.</p>.<p><b>Arterial thrombosis is an emergency</b>, since tissue cannot survive long without blood supply delivering oxygen and nutrients and shortly causing irreversible damage. When this occurs in an arm or leg, often a surgeon is consulted on an emergency basis. Arteriography may be considered, a test in which contrast material is injected into the artery in question to look for blockage on imaging studies. Sometimes, if there is a large artery that is blocked ( occluded,) this test is done in the operating room with the presumption that a surgical procedure will be needed to open the vessel and restore blood flow. An interventional radiologist may be part of the treatment team to also try to remove the clot directly or dissolve the clot with medications.</p>.<p><b>Heart attack:</b> The EKG may establish the diagnosis, although blood tests may be used to look for enzymes (troponin) that leak into the bloodstream from irritated heart muscle. In an acute heart attack, the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice is a heart catheterization. A catheter is threaded into the coronary artery to the level of the blockage, and the clot and plaque are squashed in the artery wall (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">angioplasty</a>), and a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">stent</a> is placed to keep the artery open. If the hospital does not have a cardiologist or heart catheterization facility available, clot busting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> (TPA, TNK) may be used to try to restore blood supply to the affected part of the heart. A heart catheterization may be performed later.</p>.<p><b>Acute stroke: T</b>he test of choice is a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head to look for bleeding or tumor as the cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stroke symptoms</a> instead of a blood clot blocking an artery.</p>.<p><b>Other studies:</b> Other CT studies of the head may be helpful in guiding treatment of a stroke and include CT perfusion to look at brain blood flow and CT <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">angiography</a> (CTA) to map the anatomy of the arteries and look for any acute clot that might need to be treated. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> may be considered but the test is not always readily available and also takes significantly more time to perform and interpret. If the symptoms of a stroke resolve quickly, the diagnosis becomes a transient ischemic attack (TIA, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/11_signs_and_symptoms_of_stroke/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mini-stroke</a>), and further tests may include carotid ultrasound to look for blockages in the major arteries of the neck and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">echocardiography</a> to look for blood clots in the heart that may embolize to the brain and cause permanent stroke damage in the future.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Depending upon their location, blood clots may be aggressively treated or may need nothing more than symptomatic care.</p>.<p>Clots in the deep vein system of the arm or leg may need to have the blood "thinned" with anticoagulation medications.</p>.<p>The American College of Chest Physicians' 2016 guidelines recommend that patients who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_and_pulmonary_embolism/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">deep vein thrombosis</a> (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE) be treated with different anticoagulation medications depending upon their situation.</p>.<p>NOACs work by blocking factors in the clotting cascade.

Surgery may be attempted to remove the clot, or medication may be administered directly into the clot to try to dissolve it. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alteplase/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Alteplase</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alteplase/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Activase</a>, r-tPA) or tenecteplase (TNKase) are examples of tissue plasminogen activator (see above) medications that may be used in peripheral arteries to try to restore blood supply.</p>.<p>This same approach is used for heart attack. If possible, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiac_catheterization/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">cardiac catheterization</a> is performed to locate the blocked blood vessel and a balloon is used to open the occluded area, restore blood flow, and place a stent to keep it open. This is a time-sensitive procedure and if a hospital is not available to do the procedure emergently (within 60-90 minutes of the patient's symptoms) TPA or TNK may be used intravenously to try to dissolve the thrombus and minimize heart damage. Eventually, when stable, the patient will be transferred for potential heart catheterization to evaluate the heart anatomy and decide whether <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">stents</a> may be needed to keep an artery open or whether bypass surgery might be needed to restore blood supply to the heart.</p>.<p>Stroke is also treated with tPA if the patient is an appropriate candidate for this therapy. As well, there are now opportunities in some hospitals to have an interventional radiologist or neurologist thread a catheter into the blocked artery in the brain, try to find the clot causing the stroke, and remove it. This same strategy is used for heart attack and some patients with peripheral artery clots in an arm or leg.</p>.<p>A variety of different specialists may be involved in the care of a patient with a blood clot, from diagnosis to treatment and prevention, depending upon the exact type and location of the clot. These may include internists, family medicine specialists, emergency physicians, interventional radiologists, surgeons, cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, neurologists, and critical care specialists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Prevention is key in thrombosis or clot formation.</p>.<p>The main risk factor for deep vein thrombosis risks is immobilization. It is important to move around routinely so that blood can circulate in the venous system. On long trips, it is recommended to get out of the car every couple of hours, or in an airplane to routinely get up and stretch.</p>.<p>Physicians and nurses work hard at getting people moving after surgery or while in the hospital for medical conditions. The low molecular weight heparin known as enoxaparin (Lovenox) can also be used in low doses to prevent clot formation. Patients are often given tight stockings to promote blood return from the legs and prevent pooling of blood.</p>.<p>In patients who have had hip or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/total_knee_replacement/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">knee replacement</a>, anticoagulation with a NOAC may be appropriate.</p>.<p>In patients with atrial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fibrillation</a>, anticoagulation may be appropriate depending upon the patient's underlying condition, the clinical situation, and the risk factors for stroke. Using the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system, the risk for stroke in atrial fibrillation may be calculated and discussed with the patient. This system considers various factors to determine the patient's risk:</p>.<p>Anticoagulation with a NOAC or warfarin may be appropriate.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
