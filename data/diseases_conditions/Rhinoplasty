<p><b><a name="rhinoplasty_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_rhinoplasty" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rhinoplasty 
is a facial cosmetic procedure, usually performed to enhance the appearance or 
reconstruct 
the nose. During rhinoplasty, the nasal cartilages and bones are modified, or 
tissue is added, to improve the 
visual appeal of the nose. Rhinoplasty is also frequently performed 
to repair nasal fractures. When rhinoplasty is used to repair nasal 
fractures, the goal is to restore pre-injury appearance of the nose. 
 Septorhinoplasty is a related 
procedure performed for patients who also have nasal obstruction. 
Septorhinoplasty not only improves the appearance of the nose, but it removes 
any internal obstructions and stabilizes structures that may be blocking nasal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="initial_evaluation_for_rhinoplasty" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cosmetic 
concerns and expectations should be fully discussed prior to surgery. The 
surgeon's recommendations and any particular limitations set forth by the 
structure of your nose, face, and skin 
are important to understand and have explained. Photographs (without make-up) are 
usually obtained before surgery to help with preoperative planning 
and after surgery to document postoperative results.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_before_rhinoplasty_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or 
the surgicenter. In both facilities, quality 
care can be provided without the expense and inconvenience of an 
overnight stay. An anesthesiologist is present for 
monitoring vital functions throughout the procedure. Usually, the 
anesthesiologist will call the night before surgery to review the medical 
history. Preoperative laboratory studies will need to be done several days in 
advance. Transportation after the procedure will need to be arranged 
and someone should stay with the patient during the first night.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Aspirin</a>, or 
any product containing aspirin, should not be taken within 10 days of the date 
of surgery. Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory medications (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Advil</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Motrin</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Naprosyn</a>) should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">over-the-counter products</a> contain aspirin or Advil type <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> so it is important 
to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, please call the 
office or consult a pharmacist. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tylenol</a> is an acceptable <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/analgesics_antipyretics/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain reliever</a>. Prescriptions for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> medications are usually written 
prior to the date of surgery and should be filled in advance.</p>.<p>Â No food or 
liquids should be consumed within 6 hours prior to the time of surgery. This 
includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. Smokers 
should make every effort to stop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, or at 
least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce 
postoperative <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a> and bleeding. Difficulty with tissue healing has also 
been noted in smokers during the postoperative period.</p>.<p>Any illness prior to the day of surgery should be reported to the 
surgeon's office as soon as possible. If illness occurs the day of 
surgery it is best to proceed to the surgical facility as planned and 
be evaluated to decide if surgery is safe.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_the_day_of_rhinoplasty_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is important to check in with the surgical facility on time. 
Bring all papers and forms including any preoperative orders and 
history sheets. Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes that do not 
have to be pulled over the head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at 
home. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Thoroughly wash the 
face with soap and water and do not apply make-up or creams.</p>.<p>Do not take 
any medication unless instructed to do so. Usually a nurse will start an 
intravenous infusion line (IV) in the pre-operative holding room and a medication may be given for relaxation.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_rhinoplasty_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the 
operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gas</a> and an 
intravenous medication. Continuous monitoring during the procedure usually 
includes a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">EKG</a> (cardiac rhythm). The 
surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the 
anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. 
Depending on what is required and what additional procedures are performed, the 
surgery may take one to several hours. The surgeon normally talks with any 
family or friends once the 
patient is safely in the recovery room.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_after_rhinoplasty_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients are monitored after surgery in the recovery room by a 
nurse. A patient is able to go home the same day as the surgery once 
fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several 
hours. Transportation home will need to be arranged. A responsible 
adult should be in the same residence overnight for help on short 
notice.</p>.<p>At home the patient should have bed rest with the head elevated on 
2-3 pillows. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Edema</a> and swelling are minimized by 
keeping the head elevated above the heart. An assistant should be available for 
out of bed excursions to the bathroom. Straining should be avoided. If 
constipated, take a stool softener or a gentle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactulose-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">laxative</a>.</p>.<p>Swelling 
and bruising of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around 
the eyes for several days after surgery is a normal occurrence. This 
will gradually go away over the next 7 to 10 days. Ice on the face, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bridge</a> of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated will help to 
minimize these problems. This will also help with postoperative edema 
and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>. Some patients have found frozen vegetables in packages (for 
example, bags of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which 
conforms to the face.</p>.<p>A nasal 
splint or cast will cover the outside of the nose, and 
will usually be removed one week following surgery. As swelling 
subsides, the splint tends to fit less tightly. If the cast gets wet 
it may come off prematurely; this is usually not a problem and does 
not affect the outcome of the procedure.</p>.<p>Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal, and will gradually 
decrease. The gauze dressing ("mustache dressing") will collect blood 
and should be changed only when saturated. It is not unusual to 
change these dressing every hour during the first 24 hours after 
surgery. This dressing will usually not be needed after a few days. 
Do not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (such as Advil) for 3 weeks following 
surgery.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG-->
</p>.<p>It is best 
to eat a light, soft, and cool <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> as tolerated after recovery from the 
anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. It is best to go slowly with 
food immediately after the procedure to prevent postoperative <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>. Patients occasionally vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if it persists, 
medication to settle the stomach may be prescribed. It is important 
to remember that a good overall <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> with ample rest promotes 
healing.</p>.<p>Antibiotics 
are prescribed after surgery. It is important to finish all the pills that have 
been ordered. Some form of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prescription_drug_abuse_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">narcotic</a> will also be prescribed (usually <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocodoneacetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vicodin</a>) 
which is to be taken as needed. If narcotics are taken, it is important not to 
drive or engage in activities where impaired judgment could cause injury. In 
some situations steroids may be prescribed to be taken either preoperatively 
and/or postoperatively. It is very important to take this medication as 
prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. An anti-emesis medication such 
as phenergan may be prescribed for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> postoperatively. Possible 
drug reactions to any of these medications, such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a>, should be reported 
to the doctor as soon 
as noticed. No other medications, either prescribed or over-the-
counter, should be taken without the knowledge of your doctor.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_post-operative_care_for_rhinoplasty" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most 
situations, packs will have been placed in the nose to control postoperative 
bleeding. The packing material will be removed at a scheduled postoperative 
visit. Arrangements should be made for someone else to drive to and from the 
office for this first visit. Eat a light meal before this visit and avoid taking 
excessive pain medications. Immediately after the nasal packs are removed, a 
saline 
nasal spray such as "Ocean Spray" is used several times per day to 
prevent crusts from forming in the nose. Several subsequent office 
visits are necessary to assess healing, remove crusts, and insure a 
speedy recovery. The nose is usually tender after surgery, so a spray 
of special numbing medication is used before removing crusts.</p>.<p>After the packing has been removed,  breathing through the nose is 
acceptable, but do not blow or sneeze through it for 7-10 days. Any 
sneezes should be channeled through the open mouth. Expect some light 
blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding 
becomes excessive, apply ice and rest quietly with head elevated 
while holding the nose. If bleeding continues, call the doctor.</p>.<p>Rest for 
the first week following surgery. Avoid excessive talking, smiling, hard 
chewing, strenuous activities, lifting heavy objects, bumping the nose, and 
bending over. Try not to rest glasses on the bridge of the nose until soreness 
and swelling subsides. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Contact lenses</a> can be worn once eye swelling and any 
irritation has resolved. Alcohol and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tobacco</a> should be avoided because they may 
prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and 
cause an infection. Facial tanning is discouraged for 6 
months after surgery. Number 15 or greater sun block is recommended 
during any sun exposure. Make-up may be worn anytime after surgery.</p>.<p>Lubricate 
the nostrils, as instructed, with a Q-tip and Vaseline to soften harden crusts. 
Peroxide helps to loosen crusts. After several days a few of the absorbable 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sutures</a> may become noticeable. Be gentle while brushing the upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a>. They 
will often be tender for several weeks, and there may some numbness of the teeth 
and palate for several months.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Exercise</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swimming/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swimming</a> may be resumed after 3 weeks if there are no 
bleeding problems. Diving should be postponed for two months. It is 
advisable not to schedule travel for three weeks following surgery to 
allow for proper postoperative recovery and healing.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_and_complications_of_rhinoplasty" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This surgery, as any surgery, may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes.
