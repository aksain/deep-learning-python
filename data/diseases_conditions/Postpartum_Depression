It has been described as afflicting prominent historical figures like author/suffragist Charlotte Perkins Gilman in the 19th century. This illness is characterized by depression that a woman experiences either during pregnancy or within four weeks of giving birth, affecting about 3%-6% of women who give birth, up to 20% when only women with postpartum depression, rather than including those who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">depressed</a> during the pregnancy are counted. Peripartum depression occurs after one out of every eight deliveries in the United States, affecting about half a million women every year. Peripartum depression is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">major depression</a> with peripartum onset. Delusional thinking after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childbirth_class_options/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">childbirth</a>, called postpartum psychosis, affects about one in every 500 to 1,000 women.</p>.<p>Notably, postpartum depression is not an illness that is exclusive to mothers. Fathers can experience it, as well. As with women, symptoms in men can result in fathers having difficulty caring for themselves and for their children when suffering from postpartum depression.</p>.<p>Unfortunately, up to 50% of individuals with postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis are never detected. That can result in devastating outcomes for the patient and family. For example, postpartum psychosis is thought to have been a potential factor in Andrea Yates <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drowning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drowning</a> her five children in 2001 and was explored as a factor in Susan Smith drowning her two sons in 1994.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_postpartum_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Similar to many other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mental health</a> conditions, there is thought to be a genetic vulnerability to developing postpartum depression.</p>.<p>Rapid changes in the levels of reproductive hormones that occur during pregnancy and after delivery are thought to be biological factors in the development of this condition. People with any history of depression or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> prior to the pregnancy are at risk for developing depression during the pregnancy or soon after delivery. Interestingly, men are also known to experience changes in a number of hormones during the peripartum period that can contribute to the development of PPD. Also, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> of any medical complications as a result of the pregnancy or delivery, as well as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a> that is inherent in caring for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">newborn</a> are considerable factors.</p>.<p>Further risk factors for developing postpartum depression include low self-esteem, low socioeconomic status, a lack of having social support before and after the birth of the baby, and marital problems, including any history of intimate partner violence.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_postpartum_depression_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of postpartum depression begin either during pregnancy or within four weeks after having a baby and include the following:</p>.<p>Postpartum psychosis occurs much more rarely and is thought to be a severe form of postpartum depression. Symptoms of that disorder include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_doctors_diagnose_postpartum_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has PPD. Therefore, health care providers diagnose this disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health history. Patients tend to benefit when the health care provider takes into account their client's entire life and background. This includes, but is not limited to, the person's gender, sexual orientation, cultural, religious, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The health care professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and as part of screening the individual for medical conditions that might contribute to mental health symptoms.</p>.<p>Postpartum depression must be distinguished from what is commonly called the "baby blues," which tend to occur in most new mothers. In the brief mood problem of baby blues, symptoms like crying, sadness, irritability, anxiety, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">confusion</a> can occur. In contrast to the symptoms of PPD, the symptoms of the baby blues tend to peak around the fourth day after delivery, resolve by the 10th day and do not tend to affect the individual's ability to function.</p>.<p>Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that requires immediate intervention because of the danger that the sufferer might kill their baby or themselves. Postpartum psychosis usually begins within the first two weeks after delivery. Symptoms of this disorder tend to involve extremely disorganized thinking, bizarre behavior, unusual hallucinations, and delusions. Postpartum psychosis is often a symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bipolar disorder</a>, also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">manic</a> depression.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_postpartum_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of postpartum depression in men and women is similar. Both mothers and fathers with this condition have been found to greatly benefit from being educated about the illness, as well as from the support of other parents who have been in this position.</p>.<p><b>Psychotherapies</b></p>.<p>Psychotherapy ("talk therapy") involves working with a trained therapist to determine methods to solve problems and cope with all forms of depression, including postpartum depression. It can be a powerful intervention and may produce, positive biochemical changes in the brain. This is a particularly important alternative to treatment with medication in women who are breastfeeding. In general, these therapies take weeks to months to complete. More intense counseling may be needed for longer when treating very severe depression or other psychiatric symptoms.</p>.<p>Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This helps to alleviate depressive symptoms and helps the person with PPD develop more effective skills for coping with social and interpersonal relationships. IPT employs two strategies to achieve these goals.</p>.<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This helps to alleviate depression and reduce the likelihood it will return by helping the PPD sufferer change his or her way of thinking. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals.</p>.<p>Medication therapy for postpartum depression usually involves the use of an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antidepressant</a> medication. The major types of antidepressant medication are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dopamine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dopamine</a> reuptake inhibitors (NSRIs), the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tricyclic_antidepressants-oral_injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tricyclic antidepressants</a> (TCAs), and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">monoamine oxidase inhibitors</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">MAOIs</a>). SSRI medications affect levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing doctors, these medications are the first choice because of the high level of effectiveness and general safety of this group. Examples of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antidepressants</a> are listed here. The generic name is first, with the brand name in parentheses.</p>.<p>SNRIs and NDRs:</p>.<p>TCAs are sometimes prescribed in severe cases of depression or when SSRIs or SNRIs are ineffective. These medications affect a number of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters), especially epinephrine and norepinephrine (also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively). Examples include</p>.<p>About two-thirds of people who take antidepressant medications improve. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to notice mood improvement. It is, therefore, important not to stop taking the medication because benefits may not be seen immediately. The MAOIs are not often used since the introduction of the SSRIs. Because of the possibility of interactions, the MAOIs may not be taken with many other types of medication, and some types of foods that are high in tyramine (like aged cheeses, wines, and cured meats) must be avoided as well. Examples of MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). Atypical neuroleptic medications are often prescribed in addition to a mood-stabilizer medication in people with postpartum psychosis. Examples of atypical neuroleptics include</p>.<p>Non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications are also sometimes used with a neuroleptic medication to treat people with postpartum psychosis because <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bipolar disorder</a> may also be present in some patients. Examples of non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers include</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_postpartum_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women who have suffered from postpartum depression are much more likely to have depression again sometime in the future. They are also at risk for being the victim of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as for developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smokeless_tobacco/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tobacco</a> or other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">substance abuse</a>. Children of mothers with PPD are at risk for medical emotional challenges as a result of problematic relationships with their mother and of receiving compromised care from their mother.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_postpartum_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Intensive nursing intervention in the form of visits to new mothers by a nurse can help prevent the development of postpartum depression.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_people_get_more_information_about_postpartum_depression" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jennifer Mudd Houghtaling Postpartum Depression Foundation</p>.<p>200 E.
