Cunha, DO, FACOEP</a></p>.<p><b><a name="vaginal_cancer_is_a_disease_in_which_malignant_cancer_cells_form_in_the_vagina" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The vagina is the canal leading from the cervix (the opening of uterus) to the outside of the body. At birth, a baby passes out of the body through the vagina (also called the birth canal).</p>.<p>Vaginal cancer is not common. There are two main types of vaginal cancer:</p>.<p><b><a name="age_and_being_exposed_to_the_drug_des_diethylstilbestrol_before_birth_affect_a_womans_risk_of_vaginal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for vaginal cancer include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_vaginal_cancer_include_pain_or_abnormal_vaginal_bleeding" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vaginal cancer often does not cause early signs or symptoms. It may be found during a routine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_exam/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">pelvic exam</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pap_smear/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Pap test</a>. Signs and symptoms may be caused by vaginal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="tests_that_examine_the_vagina_and_other_organs_in_the_pelvis_are_used_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_vaginal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used:</p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:</p>.<p>When found in early stages, vaginal cancer can often be cured.</p>.<p>Treatment options depend on the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="after_vaginal_cancer_has_been_diagnosed_tests_are_done_to_find_out_if_cancer_cells_have_spread_within_the_vagina_or_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the vagina or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_three_ways_that_cancer_spreads_in_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p><b><a name="cancer_may_%0Aspread_from_where_it_began_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if vaginal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually vaginal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic vaginal cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="in_vaginal_intraepithelial_neoplasia_vain_abnormal_cells_are_found_in_%0Atissue_lining_the_inside_of_the_vagina" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These abnormal cells are not cancer. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is grouped based on how deep the abnormal cells are in the tissue lining the vagina:</p>.<p>VAIN may become cancer and spread into the vaginal wall. VAIN is sometimes called stage 0.</p>.<p><b><a name="the_following_stages_are_used_for_vaginal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In stage I, cancer is found in the vaginal wall only.</p>.<p>In stage II, cancer has spread through the wall of the vagina to the tissue around the vagina. Cancer has not spread to the wall of the pelvis.</p>.<p>In stage III, cancer has spread to the wall of the pelvis.</p>.<p>Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB:</p>.<p>Recurrent vaginal cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the vagina or in other parts of the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_vaginal_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatments are available for patients with vaginal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a>. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p><b>Three types of standard treatment are used:</b></p>.<p>Surgery is the most common treatment of vaginal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:</p>.<p>Skin grafting may follow surgery, to repair or reconstruct the vagina. Skin grafting is a surgical procedure in which skin is moved from one part of the body to another. A piece of healthy skin is taken from a part of the body that is usually hidden, such as the buttock or thigh, and used to repair or rebuild the area treated with surgery.</p>.<p>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation therapy</a> after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">x-rays</a> or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat vaginal cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Chemotherapy</a> is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Topical chemotherapy for squamous cell vaginal cancer may be applied to the vagina in a cream or lotion.</p>.<p><b><a name="new_types_of_treatment_are_being_tested_in_clinical_trials" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.</p>.<p>Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.</p>.<p><b><a name="patients_may_want_to_think_about_taking_part_in_a_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p><b><a name="patients_can_enter_clinical_trials_before_during_or_after_starting_their_%0Acancer_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p><b><a name="follow-up_tests_may_be_needed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_by_stage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) 1 is usually watchful waiting.</p>.<p>Treatment of VAIN 2 and 3 may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage I squamous cell vaginal cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage I vaginal adenocarcinoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage II vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma.
