<p><b><a name="what_are_biologic_rhythms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>What are biologic rhythms? In essence, they're the rhythms of life. All forms of life on earth, including our bodies, respond rhythmically to the regular cycles of the sun, moon, and seasons.</p>.<p>For example, as night turns into day, vital body functions, including heart rate and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a>, speed up in anticipation of increased physical activity. These and other predictable fluctuations in body function, taking place during specific time cycles, are our biologic rhythms. They are regulated by "biologic clock" mechanisms located in the brain.</p>.<p>Although biologic rhythms can be "reprogrammed" by environmental influences (such as when a person regularly works the night shift and sleeps during the day), they are genetically "hard-wired" into our cells, tissues, and organs.</p>.<p>Medical chronobiologists have found that biologic rhythms can affect the severity of disease symptoms, diagnostic test results, and even the body's response to drug therapy. Now these investigators are working to discover how the rhythms of life can be used to improve the practice of medicine -- and your health.</p>.<p>These time-related medical observations, and others still in the exciting process of discovery, are rooted in chronobiology (chronos -- time; bios -- life; logos - science), the study of biologic rhythms.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_the_body_clock_affect_symptoms_of_illness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Among the various biologic rhythm cycles that medical chronobiologists study, the 24-hour day/night-activity/rest cycle is considered a key chronobiologic factor in medical diagnosis and treatment. Formally known as the circadian rhythm, it's also referred to as the "body clock."</p>.<p><b>Why is the 24-hour body clock so important? </b></p>.<p>Because so many of our normal body functions follow daily patterns of speeding up and slowing down, intensifying and diminishing, in alignment with circadian rhythm. Interestingly, so do the symptoms of a number of chronic disorders:</p>.<p><b>Allergic rhinitis:</b> (nasal inflammation associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hay fever</a>) Symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sneezing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/runny_nose/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">runny nose</a>, and stuffy nose are typically worse in the early waking hours than later during the day.</p>.<p><b>Asthma:</b> In most patients, symptoms are more than 100 times more likely to occur in the few hours prior to awakening than during the day.</p>.<p><b>Stable angina:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Chest pain</a> and electrocardiographic (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ECG</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EKG</a>) abnormalities are most common during the first 4 to 6 hours after awakening.</p>.<p><b>Prinzmetal's angina:</b> ECG abnormalities are most common during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chest pain</a> can occur even while at rest.</p>.<p><b>Heart attack:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Heart attack</a> most commonly occurs in the early waking hours.</p>.<p><b>Stroke:</b> Strokes most commonly occur in the early waking hours.</p>.<p><b>Hypertension:</b> The highest blood pressure readings typically occur from late morning to middle afternoon; lowest occur during early <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a>.

However, untreated long-term <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high blood pressure</a> can lead to strokes, heart diseases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">kidney disease</a>, and eye damage. Medical scientists now know that a person's blood pressure varies according to the time of day (circadian rhythm). Such variations may have important implications in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with high blood pressure.</p>.<p>It is important to understand a critical distinction: Circadian rhythms do not cause clinical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">hypertension</a> in normotensives (people with normal blood pressure). Circadian rhythms do, however, result in a cyclic worsening of hypertension in hypertensive patients.</p>.<p>In the majority of individuals - normotensive and hypertensive - blood pressure rises rapidly in the early morning hours, the time when most individuals wake up and begin their day. This morning rise in blood pressure is not caused by the act of getting out of bed and beginning activity. It is a genetically preset system that automatically increases a person's blood pressure at that time.</p>.<p>For example, if a person goes to sleep at around 10 p.m., beginning in the very early morning - sometime between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. – the blood pressure begins to rise and continues to rise through the morning.</p>.<p>This increase, which is accompanied by an increase in heart rate, corresponds to the following biologic changes, which are also governed by circadian rhythms:</p>.<p>Catecholamines, norepinephrine, and renin are natural hormones produced by the kidneys and adrenal glands (small glands located near the top of both kidneys). These hormones cause tightening of blood vessels in the body (vasoconstriction). Vasoconstriction causes resistance to blood flow and elevates blood pressure.</p>.<p>The vasoconstricting effects of catecholamines may also be enhanced in the morning by the high levels of certain hormones which interact with catecholamines and increase their effects. Many high blood pressure medications are designed to counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of these hormones.</p>.<p>In the late morning or early afternoon, the natural rise in blood pressure reaches its peak. After that, blood pressure declines, falling 15 to 20 mmHg between about 8 p.m. and 2 a.m., the time at which blood pressure is normally at its lowest point.</p>.<p>The blood pressure pattern just described is typical of some individuals, whether the individual is hypertensive or normotensive. These people are referred to as "dippers." In other individuals (called "nondippers"), there is no nightly decline in blood pressure. The blood pressure in these people remains high, even during sleep.</p>.<p>Disease of the heart and blood vessels (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardiovascular disease</a>), including hypertension and the syndromes of ischemic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">heart disease</a> (angina, heart attack, sudden death), also follow circadian rhythms. This pattern makes sense when you consider that heart rate and blood levels of enzymes and catecholamines that strongly influence blood pressure and heart function follow circadian rhythms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="hay_fever_allergic_rhinitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Allergic rhinitis</a> (hay fever) is a very common condition, affecting 17.6 million Americans annually.

A group of active asthma patients recorded the occurrence of acute asthma attacks, manifested by dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and wheezing, during a medication trial.</p>.<p>The incidence of asthma attacks was more than 100 times greater during nighttime sleep, especially around 4 a.m., than it was during the middle of the day.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_the_body_clock__affect_diagnostic_testing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The body clock's powerful influence can also be seen in the way it affects diagnostic test results. These results can vary significantly, possibly producing inaccurate readings, depending on the time of day when a test is done.</p>.<p>Consider how the body clock affects blood pressure. Blood pressure isn't constant throughout the day and night; it normally rises in the morning, remains elevated during the day and early evening, and decreases to its lowest level during sleep. So a single reading taken during the day may not give a true picture of whether blood pressure is within the normal range or requires treatment. Some doctors now ask patients to wear special monitoring devices that provide a complete 24-hour blood pressure pattern by recording blood pressures a number of times during the day.</p>.<p>The body clock also affects skin testing for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergies</a>. Results are lower in the morning, considerably higher in the evening, and greatest just before bedtime.</p>.<p>The body clock may complicate testing for asthma severity. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Airway</a> patency, or degree of openness, is poorest during the night and best during midday and evening. The same is generally true for forced expiratory volume and peak expiratory flow readings, which can be up to 50% higher at midday and in the afternoon than overnight or when the patient wakes up. Unless these circadian rhythms are taken into account, daytime evaluation of asthma patients could result in underestimating the severity of the disease.</p>.<p><b>What's being done to help doctors obtain the most accurate results from diagnostic tests likely to be affected by the body clock? </b></p>.<p>Just heightening their awareness of chronobiology has been important. In addition, medical chronobiologists are working to develop test interpretation guidelines that take circadian rhythms into account for doctors.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_drug_therapy_be_matched_to_the_body_clock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The time of day also can affect the way our bodies respond to medical therapy, especially drug therapy. Investigators working in a special area of chronobiology, called chronotherapeutics or chronotherapy, are studying these effects. Their goal is to come up with new medications, or improve existing ones, that make the most of what we know about how the body clock works.</p>.<p>Already there is evidence that taking medication "by the clock" helps the drugs work better and reduces their side effects. Currently, some doctors are prescribing nighttime administration of medication for patients with ulcer disease or asthma (which worsen at night), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a> (which worsens in the early morning hours), and high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cholesterol levels</a> (most of the body's cholesterol production occurs at night).
