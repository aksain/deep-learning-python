A person develops immunity after he or she has received a vaccine and responded to it. When a vaccinated person is exposed to a virus (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis B</a>) or bacteria (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diphtheria</a>), his or her body is able to destroy the virus or bacteria and prevent the disease. No vaccine is perfect, and some people who receive a vaccine can still get the disease. This is why it is important for everyone to get the vaccine. This gives the community what experts call "herd" immunity and means that, basically, there are very few people who could serve as a reservoir for the disease. Herd immunity prevents severe outbreaks of diseases.</p>.<p>The following table lists vaccine-preventable diseases:</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_vaccination_schedule_for_adolescents" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_vaccination_schedule_for_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_vaccines_should_a_pregnant_woman_get" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The concerns surrounding the dangers of vaccines during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> is mostly theoretical. The concern is related to the risk of transfer to the fetus. There is no evidence of any risk associated with the use of inactivated (killed) vaccines in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> women. The biggest concern is related to the use of live vaccines. While the risk is extremely low, the concern is that the live virus will be transferred from the mother to the fetus. There must be a discussion between the physician and the mother whenever a live vaccine is considered during pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a guide to help expectant mothers and physicians make good decisions related to the risk and benefits of using a vaccine during pregnancy (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html" onclick="popupWarning();" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html</a>).

The Tdap also contains a vaccine against pertussis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">whooping cough</a>). Most adults are used to getting a tetanus shot when they get a cut. Up until 2005, adolescents and adults were not recommended to receive the pertussis vaccine due to an unacceptable rate of negative reactions. In 2005, a new acellular pertussis vaccine became available for both children and adults (although there are different ones for each group using different amounts of each vaccine). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis_and_whooping_cough_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Whooping cough</a> has become a serious problem again due to the lack of vaccination in adolescents and adults.

The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gardasil_vaccine_hpv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Gardasil</a>-9 vaccine available in the U.S. protects against nine types of HPV -- the four contained in the original Gardasil vaccine (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), plus five additional strains (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).</p>.<p>Studies have shown that use of the vaccine will decrease the chance that a woman will get <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cervical cancer</a>. As such, the vaccine must be given before the first sexual contact. The CDC recommends that all girls and boys receive the three-shot series beginning at 11 years of age. Boys need vaccination in order to prevent spread to girls and to protect against cancers of the anus, mouth/throat (oropharynx), and penis. Adult women who have not received the vaccine should do so up to 26 years of age. After 26 years of age, it is believed that most women would have been exposed to the virus and the vaccine would be of no use.</p>.<p>If a person receives the vaccine before age 15 and is going to receive the Gardasil 9, it is a two-shot series; however, if the vaccine is not received until after the 15th birthday or if the series was begun using an earlier version of the Gardasil vaccine or the discontinued Cervarix vaccine, it is recommended that they receive a three-shot series.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_meningococcal_vaccine_and_who_should_receive_it" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Meningococcal disease is a serious acute illness caused by a bacterium.

There are two different quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines that provide protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY, MPSV4). A newer vaccine (Bexsero or Trumenba) against meningococcal serogroup B is also now available and should be given to high-risk individuals, with the injection given at the same time as the quadrivalent vaccine but at a different body site. The disease is more common in adolescents and college students. Therefore, meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all children between 11-12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years of age. If the child has not received the vaccine by 11-12 years of age, they should receive it up to age 18. College freshmen who have not received the vaccine should be vaccinated. The vaccines are also recommended for adults with special medical conditions.</p>.<p>In 2017, the CDC changed their recommendation for people age 16 to 23 to now receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (MenB) (Bexsero or Trumenba). It has not been mandated, but doctors are recommended to consider the serogroup B vaccine in this age group. Additionally, if there are any outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on a college campus, the CDC recommends the use of serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (Bexsero or Trumenba).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_mmr_vaccine_and_who_should_receive_it" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The MMR vaccine contains vaccines against the diseases measles, mumps, and rubella (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">German measles</a>). These are all dangerous and potentially fatal diseases that have been successfully limited in the United States through aggressive vaccine programs. Adolescents and adults who have not received the MMR or MMRV (MMR, plus the varicella vaccine) should receive two doses of the vaccine at least one month apart. People who do not have medical documentation of having had the diseases or cannot prove previous vaccination should have titers (blood tests to check levels of immunity) drawn to make sure they are immune to these agents.

The vaccine came out in the mid-1990s and unfortunately does not offer complete protection, but even those who get the disease after vaccination have a milder form of the condition. Prior to use of the vaccine, hundreds of children died every year from chickenpox.

Unfortunately, the influenza virus changes a little each year, and scientists have to make educated guesses about which forms of the virus will be infecting people and circulating each year. Based on the best available evidence, they create a vaccine each year containing three of the likely influenza virus types.</p>.<p>The annual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu_vaccination/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">flu vaccine</a> is an inactivated vaccine (shot). You cannot get the flu from getting the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu_vaccination/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">flu shot</a> because it has inactivated virus (virus killed with heat or chemicals). The immunity from the vaccines is limited, and vaccinations must be repeated yearly. It is recommended that all people older than 6 months of age receive an annual vaccination. In 2017, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology changed their guidance for patients with egg allergy. They no longer recommend that doctors screen for egg allergy prior to administering the flu shot, and they recommend that patients with egg allergy receive the currently available flu shot even though it has been created in eggs. There is only minimal egg protein in the shot, and there is no increased risk of reaction for patients with egg allergy. There is also a vaccine recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV) that contains no egg protein because it is not manufactured with eggs. Although the CDC encourages that any adult who wants to decrease the chance of getting the flu get the influenza vaccine, certain high-risk groups are recommended to always get the annual flu vaccine. Adults over 50 years of age are considered to be at high risk and should receive the yearly influenza vaccination.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_people_with_severe_egg_allergies_still_get_an_annual_influenza_vaccination" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In December 2017, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology published an updated guideline and recommended that patients with egg allergy receive the influenza vaccine.
