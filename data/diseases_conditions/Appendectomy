This procedure is most 
often performed as an emergency operation. In some patients undergoing abdominal 
surgery for another reason, may have their appendix removed prophylactically so

</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_prepare_for_an_appendectomy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of appendectomy operations are typically emergency surgeries so the patient needs to follow the instructions given by the surgeon. In general, the patient is advised not to eat food, although with the symptoms, they are usually not hungry anyway. The patient may be treated with medications to reduce or eliminate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a>; IV antibiotics may also be initiated before surgery.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_an_appendectomy_performed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Appendectomy is most often done in the operating room after the patient's 
skin has been shaved to remove hair and swabbed with a germ killing solution; 
sterility precautions are taken to prevent infection. The appendix may be 
removed by an open method or the 
laparoscopic technique. The open method 
requires a 2 to 3 inch incision in the lower rightâ€“hand side of the abdomen to 
remove the appendix, while the laparoscopic method uses several small incisions 
in the abdomen and the use of a laparoscope to visualize and then remove the appendix.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_recovery_time_for_an_appendectomy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The recovery time for an appendectomy is variable and depends on the type of 
the procedure, type of anesthesia, and any complications that may have developed. 
For example, laparoscopic appendectomy may be done on an outpatient basis so 
that the patient can be discharged to recover at home, while an open 
method may require an overnight stay or an even longer time to be discharged 
to go home. Normal activities can resume in a few days but full recovery may take 4 
to 6 
weeks during which time strenuous activity should be avoided.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_and_risks_of_appendectomy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_long-term_consequences_of_removing_the_appendix" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For most individuals there are no long-term consequences of removing the 
appendix. However, some individuals may have an increased risk of developing an
