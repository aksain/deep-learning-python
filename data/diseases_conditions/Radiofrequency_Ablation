<p><b><a name="what_is_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa_of_the_liver" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a technique that uses high frequency 
electrical energy that creates heat, delivered through a thin instrument known 
as a probe, to destroy tissue. It is used in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> to destroy tumors 
(either primary 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver cancers</a> or cancers that have metastasized or spread to the 
liver) that cannot be removed by traditional surgery. </p>.<p>Radiofrequency ablation also is  used in many 
other medical conditions. Examples of other uses of radiofrequency ablation include: </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_uses_of_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa_of_the_liver" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Radiofrequency ablation is used to treat hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) of the liver, primary 
cancers that arise in the liver cells, when these tumors are small and the 
patient is not an appropriate candidate for surgical removal of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a> or 
liver transplantation. Radiofrequency ablation also can be used on liver tumors that have originated 
elsewhere in the body and have spread (metastasized) to the liver.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_size_tumor_is_treated_by_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The maximum size for a liver tumor to be treated by ablation has not been 
established. However, radiofrequency ablation is best suited for tumors less than 5 cm. Larger 
tumors may require more than one session.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_prepare_for_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to prepare for the 
procedure. You may be advised to stop taking blood-thinner medications before 
the procedure and not to drink or eat anything for some hours beforehand. 
Depending on the type of radiofrequency ablation that is done, and whether or not anesthesia is 
required, you may be able to return home after the procedure, or you may remain 
overnight in the hospital.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_kind_of_equipment_is_used_for_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Imaging procedures like 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT</a> (computed tomography) 
scan, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a>, or magnetic 
resonance imaging (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>) are used to help guide the probe into the area of the 
tumor. The probe is designed like a long needle electrode through which a 
high-frequency electrical current is passed.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_the_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa_procedure_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Radiofrequency ablation can be performed in different ways. It may be 
administered during open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, or percutaneously 
(through the skin) using imaging studies to guide the placement of the probe. 
Interventional radiologists are the doctors who most commonly perform RFA 
through the skin, while surgeons may perform RFA during laparoscopic or open 
surgeries. </p>.<p>In all cases of radiofrequency ablation, a probe is inserted into the center of the tumor and the 
non-insulated electrodes, which are shaped like prongs, are projected out from 
the central probe into the tumor. The local heat that is generated melts the 
tissue (in a process known as coagulative necrosis) that is adjacent to the 
probe. The probe is left in place for about 10 to 15 minutes. For larger tumors 
it might be necessary to re-position the probe in different areas of the tumor. 
Imaging studies are done anywhere from a few hours to weeks after the procedure 
to ensure that the entire tumor tissue has been cauterized.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_expect_during_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Radiofrequency ablation may be done using local anesthesia or general anesthesia (typically if 
RFA is performed during surgery). Radiofrequency ablation performed by inserting the needle probe 
through the skin can be done under local anesthesia in which the skin insertion 
site is numbed. Typically, an intravenous line is placed for delivery of fluid 
and medications. Monitoring devices to measure heart rate and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> are 
attached to the body. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_the_procedure_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Each radiofrequency ablation typically takes 10-30 minutes. Ablating more than 
one area requires more time. The entire procedure is usually finished in 1-3 
hours. After the procedure, the patient remains in a recovery room 
until fully awake. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_and_side_effects_of_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Radiofrequency ablation is generally well-tolerated, and does not typically cause any serious pain 
after the treatment. There is a very low risk of bleeding or infection after the 
treatment as well as a low risk of injury to the gallbladder or bile ducts. 
Sometimes, a low-grade <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu</a>-like symptoms may be present after the 
procedure for a few days. </p>.<p> Other possible side effects of radiofrequency ablation include </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_success_rate_of_radiofrequency_ablation_rfa_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most studies, radiofrequency ablation is over 85% successful at destroying small liver tumors. 
Studies also show that over half of the tumors removed by radiofrequency 
ablation do not recur (come 
back). Because the treatment typically does not cause serious health risks, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a> can be resumed (if needed) soon after the procedure. 
Radiofrequency 
ablation usually 
has few complications, and can be repeated if necessary for the same or 
additional tumors.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
