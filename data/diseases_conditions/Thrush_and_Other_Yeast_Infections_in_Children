<p><b><a name="what_are_yeast_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>What are commonly known as "yeast" infections are caused by various species of a yeast-like fungus called <i>Candida</i>, particularly the species <i>Candida albicans</i>. Yeast organisms are some of the germs (including bacteria) that normally reside on various parts of the body and that ordinarily cause no symptoms or signs.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_do_yeast_sometimes_cause_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, may upset the balance of microbes in the body (particularly between the bacteria and fungi) and allow an overgrowth of <i>Candida</i>. Yeast also can thrive in chronically moist folds of skin, such as in the groin.</p>.<p>Yeast infections may flare up and then heal in most people. However, in newborns or individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast can cause more serious or chronic infections.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_babies_get_yeast_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many infants acquire <i>Candida</i> infections from their mothers during the process of birth. Yeast exists naturally in the mother's vagina.

Thrush appears as creamy white curd-like patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth and back of the throat. As mentioned above, in individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast infections are more common. For example, in a non-infant population, thrush may be a sign of underlying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a> infection. The child may not have any symptoms from the condition or may refuse to eat or swallow because of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> or an unusual feeling in the mouth.

In children (and adults) taking antibiotics or steroids (such as cortisone-related <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_medications/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma medications</a>), the balance of the normal microbes in the mouth can be disturbed.
