The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">oral glucose tolerance test</a> (OGTT)

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 2 diabetes</a>. It is still commonly used during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> for diagnosing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gestational_diabetes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gestational diabetes</a>. With an oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glucose</a> tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 
hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives 
a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drinks</a>. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sugar</a> to measure the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood glucose</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_reliable_is_the_glucose_tolerance_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">common cold</a>). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose. In preparation for the 
oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not 
smoke or consume

Some physicians simply take a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a>, the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diabetes</a>, glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.</p>.<p>People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels have so-called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">impaired glucose tolerance</a> (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes.</p>.<p>Each year, 5% to 10% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually develop diabetes. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Weight loss</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metformin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">metformin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metformin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Glucophage</a>), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, and whether impaired glucose tolerance turns out to be an entity that deserves treatment itself is something that physicians are currently debating.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_preparation_for_a_glucose_tolerance_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned previously, preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test involves fasting overnight (from 8 
to 16 hours) and participating normally in activities of daily living. The individual should eat and drink as they normally do prior to the test. The morning of the test, the person should not 
consume <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a> or smoke.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_results_of_the_glucose_tolerance_test_evaluated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_glucose_tolerance_testing_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned previously, the glucose tolerance test is used for the diagnosis 
of gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy). It may be 
used if there are equivocal fasting or random blood glucose results, or to 
screen for gestational diabetes in pregnant women between 24 to 28 weeks of 
gestation who are not known to have diabetes.	 </p>.<p>The test may also be used in the postpartum period to detect diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Women who had gestational diabetes do not always develop diabetes later in life, but they should undergo diabetes screening at least every 
three years throughout their life.	 <span id="cntid"></span></p>
