<p><b><a name="what_is_c-reactive_protein_crp" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. CRP is produced in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> and its level is measured by testing the blood.</p>.<p>CRP is classified as an acute phase reactant, which means that its levels will rise in response to inflammation. Other common acute phase reactants include the erythrocyte <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">sedimentation rate</a> (ESR) and blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">platelet count</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_of_high_c-reactive_protein" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no signs or symptoms that are specific for an elevated C-reactive protein level, because it is not a specific test. Signs or symptoms, if present, would depend on the underlying inflammatory condition that is the cause of the elevated CRP level.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_normal_range_for_c-reactive_protein" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>C-reactive protein is a marker of inflammation and is typically not detected in the blood unless some degree of inflammation is present in the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_it_mean_to_have_high_c-reactive_protein_levels_in_the_blood" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In general, the main causes of increased CRP and other markers of inflammation are a variety of conditions, including</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_c-reactive_protein_measured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>CRP measurement is made using a blood sample from a vein. The sample is then taken to a laboratory and analyzed.</p>.<p>The traditional CRP measurement is often used to detect inflammation in the body. Your health-care provider may order a C-reactive protein level to check for flare-ups of inflammatory diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lupus</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vasculitis</a> or to monitor whether anti-inflammatory medications are working to treat a disease or condition.</p>.<p>Currently, a more highly sensitive measurement to detect CRP is used for cardiovascular risk assessment. This high-sensitive C-reactive protein is termed hs-CRP.</p>.<p>Because measuring CRP levels at any point in time may be influenced by any infection or inflammation in the body, onetime measurement is generally not regarded as an adequate predictor of cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends checking two separate CRP levels approximately two weeks apart and using the average number of the two readings for cardiovascular risk assessment and screening purposes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_high_c-reactive_protein" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of an elevated CRP in the context of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardiovascular disease</a>, in and of itself, may be meaningless. Instead, appropriate treatment and prevention of the underlying risks and conditions need to be the primary focus of cardiovascular risk reduction.</p>.<p>The most effective and reliable ways to reduce many cardiac factors are regular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>, balanced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cigarette smoking</a> cessation.

In those without known cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors for it, aspirin use is not generally recommended. Some diabetic medications (thiazolidinediones) have also been shown to reduce CRP levels in people with or without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes mellitus</a>.

According to recent studies, after adjusting for these traditional risk factors, elevated CRP level alone is unlikely to be a cause of cardiovascular disease.</p>.<p>Nevertheless, CRP may be used as a predictor of cardiovascular disease based on its correlation with the other known cardiac risk factors and their role in the formation of atherosclerosis. In individuals with some or all of these traditional risk factors, the elevated CRP levels have been detected. Some data even suggest a trend of higher CRP elevation in the presence of higher number of risk factors.</p>.<p><b><a name="should_i_have_my_c-reactive_protein_level_tested" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Checking the CRP level for the entire adult population is not recommended.</p>.<p>Some experts recommend checking the serum CRP level routinely along with the cholesterol level; however, although this is not widely accepted.

Atherosclerosis, or cholesterol plaquing of the arteries, is known to have an inflammatory component that is thought to cause the rise in CRP levels in the blood.

This injury acts as focus of inflammation and leads to the formation of plaques in the blood vessel walls. The plaques typically contain blood cells of inflammation, cholesterol deposits, and debris from the injured cells in the blood vessel lining. The accumulation of these elements leads to narrowing of the wall of the blood vessel. The blood vessel narrowing can hinder the blood flow and the plaque can rupture and flake off the blood vessel wall causing blockage and leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strokes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a>.</p>.<p>The burden of plaques in the body can be proportional to the degree of CRP elevation in persons with atherosclerosis. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Atherosclerotic</a> plaques can exist in different stages throughout the body.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
