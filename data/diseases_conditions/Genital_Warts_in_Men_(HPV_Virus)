<p><b><a name="hpv_virus_genital_warts__in_men_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Much of the information about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genital_warts_in_women/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a> virus (human 
papillomavirus) centers on women, since having the virus increases their risk of 
getting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cervical cancer</a>. But <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a> virus in men can cause health problems, too. So 
it's important for men to understand how to reduce the risks of HPV infection.
</p>.<p>It can increase a man's risk of getting genital cancers, although these 
cancers are not common. HPV can also cause 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genital_warts_in_women/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">genital warts</a> in men, just as in 
women. </p>.<p>More than half of men who are sexually active in the United States will have 
HPV at some time in their life. Often, a man will clear the virus on his own, 
with no health problems. </p>.<p><b><a name="risks_of_hpv_virus_in_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the 30 or so types of HPV associated with 
genital cancers can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anal_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer of the anus</a> or 
penis in men. Both of these 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> types are rare. In those with a healthy immune system, they are even 
rarer. About 1,530 men in the U.S. were diagnosed with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/penis_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer of the penis</a> in 
2006, according to American <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cancer</a> Society estimates. About 1,910 men got a 
diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anal_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anal cancer</a>. </p>.<p>The risk of anal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> is about 17 times higher in sexually active gay and 
bisexual men than in men who have sex only with women. Men who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV</a> (human 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">immunodeficiency</a> virus) are also at higher risk of getting this cancer. </p>.<p>Other types of HPV virus rarely cause cancer in men, but they do cause 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">genital warts</a>. At a given point in time, about 1% of sexually active men in the 
U.S. will have genital <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">warts</a>. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="male_hpv_the_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The types of high-risk HPV that can cause cancer 
rarely present any symptoms in men or in women. Genital <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/warts_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">warts</a> are the first 
symptom you may see with low-risk HPV <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strains</a> that cause warts but not cancer.
</p>.<p><b><a name="tests_for_hpv_virus_in_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To diagnose genital warts in men, the doctor will 
visually check a man's genital area to see if warts are present. Some doctors 
will apply a vinegar solution to help identify warts that aren't raised and 
visible. But the test is not foolproof. Sometimes normal skin is mistakenly 
identified as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wart</a>. </p>.<p>There is no routine test for men to check for high-risk HPV <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid_pictures_slideshow_bumps_bruises_sprains/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strains</a> that can 
cause cancer. However, some doctors are urging anal Pap tests for gay and 
bisexual men, who are at higher risk of anal cancer caused by HPV. In an anal 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pap_smear/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pap test</a>, the doctor collects cells from the anus, and then has them checked for 
abnormalities in a lab. </p>.<p><b><a name="treatments_for_hpv" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no treatment for asymptomatic HPV infection. 
Instead, doctors treat the health problems that are caused by the HPV virus.</p>.<p>When genital warts appear, a variety of treatments can be used. The patient 
can apply prescription creams at home. Or a doctor can surgically remove or 
freeze off the warts. </p>.<p>Early treatment of warts is discouraged by some doctors because genital warts 
can go away on their own. It can also take time for all warts to appear. So a 
person who treats warts as soon as they appear may need another treatment later 
on. </p>.<p>Anal cancer can be treated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a>, and surgery. The 
specific treatments depend on the stage of cancer - how big the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a> is and how 
far the cancer has spread. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="hpv_vaccine_for_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gardasil_vaccine_hpv/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV vaccine</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gardasil_vaccine_hpv/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Gardasil</a>, approved for use in women in 
2006, is not yet approved for men. </p>.<p>Studies are still being done to determine if the vaccine works in males. 
Eventually, public health experts say, boys and men may be vaccinated. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_to_manage_hpv_in_a_relationship" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If a man's long-term sexual partner has 
HPV, chances are good HPV transmission has already occurred and he also has it. 
HPV in men may clear from the body more easily than in women. Women, in general, 
often clear the virus in two years or less. </p>.<p>The HPV types associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cervical cancer</a> usually do not cause health 
problems for a heterosexual man having sex with an HPV-infected woman. </p>.<p>If a partner has HPV, it does not necessarily mean they have had sex with 
someone else recently. The virus can lay dormant in the body for years without 
causing noticeable symptoms. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_to_prevent_transmission_of_hpv" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Abstinence is the only sure way to prevent 
HPV transmission. Risk of transmission can be lowered if a person has sex only 
with one person who is not infected and who is monogamous. </p>.<p>To lower the risk of HPV transmission, men can also limit the number of sex 
partners and pick partners who have had few or no partners in the past. </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/condoms/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Condoms</a> can provide some protection against HPV transmission. But they aren't 
100% effective, since HPV is transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact. The 
virus can still infect the skin uncovered by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">condom</a>. </p>.<p>In a recent study of young women who had just become sexually active, those 
whose partners used a condom each time they had sex were 70% less likely to get 
an HPV infection than were women whose partners used a condom less than 5% of 
the time.</p>.<p><b>WebMD Medical Reference</b></p>.<p class="credits">SOURCES: Joel Palefsky, MD, professor of medicine, University of California,
