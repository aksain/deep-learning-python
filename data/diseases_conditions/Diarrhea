<p><b><a name="diarrhea_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements or a decrease in the form of stool (greater looseness of stool). Although changes in frequency of bowel movements and looseness of stools can vary independently of each other, changes often occur in both.</p>.<p>Diarrhea needs to be distinguished from four other conditions. Although these conditions may accompany diarrhea, they often have different causes and different treatments than diarrhea. These other conditions are:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_considered_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diarrhea can be defined in absolute or relative terms based on either the frequency of bowel movements or the consistency (looseness) of stools.</p>.<p><b>Frequency of bowel movements:</b> Absolute diarrhea is having more bowel movements than normal. Thus, since among healthy individuals the maximum number of daily bowel movements is approximately three, diarrhea can be defined as any number of stools greater than three, although some consider five or more bowel movements to be diarrhea. "<b>Relative diarrhea</b>" is having more bowel movements than usual. Thus, if an individual who usually has one bowel movement each day begins to have two bowel movements each day, then relative diarrhea is present-even though there are not more than three or five bowel movements a day, that is, there is not absolute diarrhea.</p>.<p><b>Consistency of stools:</b> Absolute diarrhea is more difficult to define on the consistency of stool because the consistency of stool can vary considerably in healthy individuals depending on their diets. Thus, individuals who eat large amounts of vegetables will have looser stools than individuals who eat few vegetables and/or fruits. Stools that are liquid or watery are always abnormal and considered diarrheal. Relative diarrhea is easier to define based on the consistency of stool. Thus, an individual who develops looser stools than usual has relative diarrhea--even though the stools may be within the range of normal with respect to consistency.</p>.<p>With diarrhea, stools usually are looser whether or not the frequency of bowel movements have increased. This looseness of stool--which can vary all the way from slightly soft to watery--is caused by increased water in the stool. During normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a>, food is kept liquid by the secretion of large amounts of water by the stomach, upper small intestine, pancreas, and gallbladder. Food that is not digested reaches the lower small intestine and colon in liquid form. The lower small intestine and particularly the colon absorb the water, turning the undigested food into a more-or-less solid stool with form. Increased amounts of water in stool can occur if the stomach and/or small intestine secrete too much fluid, the distal small intestine and colon do not absorb enough water, or the undigested, liquid food passes too quickly through the small intestine and colon for enough water to be removed.</p>.<p>Another way of looking at the <b>reasons for diarrhea</b> is to divide it into five types.</p>.<p>Diarrhea generally is divided into two types, acute and chronic.</p>.<p>It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic diarrhea because they usually have different causes, require different diagnostic tests, and require different treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_signs_and_symptoms_are_associated_with_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms associated with diarrhea depend on the cause and type of diarrhea.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_common_causes_of_acute_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The most common cause of acute diarrhea is infection--viral, bacterial, and parasitic.

Bacterial enterocolitis is characterized by signs of inflammation (blood or pus in the stool, fever, abdominal tenderness), as well as abdominal pain and diarrhea. <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> is the most common bacterium that causes acute enterocolitis in the U.S. Other bacteria that cause enterocolitis include <i>Shigella, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/salmonella_food_poisoning_salmonellosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Salmonella</a></i>, and EPEC.

Unfortunately, infection also is increasing among individuals who have neither taken antibiotics nor have been in the hospital.</p>.<p><i>E. coli O157:H7</i> is a strain of <i>E. coli</i> that produces a toxin that causes hemorrhagic enterocolitis (enterocolitis with bleeding). There was a famous outbreak of hemorrhagic enterocolitis in the U.S. traced to contaminated ground beef in hamburgers (hence, it is also called hamburger colitis).

The toxins cause abdominal pain (cramps) and vomiting, which causes the small intestine to secrete large amounts of water that leads to diarrhea. The symptoms of food poisoning usually last less than 24 hours. With some bacteria, the toxins are produced in the food before it is eaten, while with other bacteria, the toxins are produced in the intestine after the food is eaten.</p>.<p>Symptoms usually appear within several hours when food poisoning is caused by toxins that are formed in the food before it is eaten. It takes longer for symptoms to develop when the toxins are formed in the intestine (because it takes time for the bacteria to produce the toxins). Therefore, in the latter case, symptoms usually appear after 7-15 hours.</p>.<p><i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Staphylococcus aureus</a> </i> is an example of a bacterium that produces toxins in food before it is eaten.

The <i>Staphylococcal</i> bacteria multiply in the food and produce toxins. <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> is an example of a bacterium that multiplies in food (usually canned food), and produces toxins in the small intestine after the contaminated food is eaten.</p>.<p><b><a name="parasites" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Parasitic infections are not common causes of diarrhea in the U.

The clue to drug-induced diarrhea is that the diarrhea begins soon after treatment with the drug is begun.

Other classes of medication that cause diarrhea include:</p>.<p>A few examples of specific medications that commonly cause diarrhea are:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_common_causes_of_chronic_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Irritable bowel syndrome:</b> The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">irritable bowel syndrome</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">IBS</a>) is a functional cause of diarrhea or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a>. Inflammation does not typically exist in the affected bowel. (Nevertheless, recent information suggests that MAY be a component of inflammation in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibs_pictures_slideshow_understanding_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">IBS</a>.) It may be caused by several different underlying problems, but it is believed that the most common cause is rapid passage of the intestinal contents through the colon.</p>.<p><b>Infectious diseases:</b> A few infectious diseases can cause chronic diarrhea, for example, <i>Giardia lamblia</i>. Patients with AIDS often have chronic infections of their intestines that cause diarrhea.</p>.<p><b>Bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine:</b> Because of small intestinal problems, normal colonic bacteria may spread from the colon and into the small intestine. When they do, they are in a position to digest food that the small intestine has not had time to digest and absorb. The mechanism that leads to the development of diarrhea in bacterial overgrowth is not clear.</p>.<p><b>Post-infectious:</b> Following acute viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections, some individuals develop chronic diarrhea. The cause of this type of diarrhea is not clear, but some of the individuals may have bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. They also have been found to have abnormalities, either microscopic or biochemical, in biopsies of the intestines that suggest that there may be inflammation. This condition also is referred to as post-infectious <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">IBS</a>.</p>.<p><b>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):</b> Crohn's disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ulcerative colitis</a>, diseases causing inflammation of the small intestine and/or colon, commonly cause chronic diarrhea.</p>.<p><b>Colon cancer:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Colon cancer</a> can cause either diarrhea or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation_myths_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">constipation</a>. If the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> blocks the passage of stool, it usually causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">constipation</a>. Sometimes, however, there is secretion of water behind the blockage, and liquid stool from behind the blockage leaks around the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> and results in diarrhea. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Cancer</a>, particularly in the distal part of the colon, can lead to thin stools. The diarrhea or constipation caused by cancer usually is progressive, that is, becomes progressively worse. Cancer in the rectum can lead to a sense of incomplete evacuation.</p>.<p><b>Severe constipation:</b> By blocking the colon, hardened stool can lead to the same problems as colon cancer, as discussed previously.</p>.<p><b>Carbohydrate (sugar) malabsorption:</b> Carbohydrate or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sugar</a> malabsorption is an inability to digest and absorb sugars. The most recognized malabsorption of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sugar</a> occurs with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactose_intolerance/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lactase deficiency</a> (also known as lactose or milk intolerance) in which milk products containing the milk sugar, lactose, lead to diarrhea. The lactose is not broken up in the intestine because of the absence of an intestinal enzyme, lactase that normally breaks up lactose into its component sugars, galactose, and glucose. Without being broken up, lactose cannot be absorbed into the body. The undigested lactose reaches the colon and pulls water (by osmosis) into the colon. The lactose also is digested by colonic bacteria into <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gas</a> (hydrogen and methane) as well as chemicals that promote the retention or secretion of fluid in the colon. The result of these events leads to diarrhea. Although lactose is the most common form of sugar malabsorption, other sugars in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> also may cause diarrhea, including fructose and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sorbitol-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sorbitol</a>.</p>.<p><b>Fat malabsorption:</b> Malabsorption of fat is the inability to digest or absorb fat. Fat malabsorption may occur because of reduced pancreatic secretions that are necessary for normal digestion of fat (for example, due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pancreatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pancreatitis</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pancreatic_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pancreatic cancer</a>) or by diseases of the lining of the small intestine that prevent the absorption of digested fat (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/celiac_disease_gluten_enteropathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">celiac disease</a>). Undigested fat enters the last part of the small intestine and colon where bacteria turn it into substances (chemicals) that cause water to be secreted by the small intestine and colon. Passage through the small intestine and colon also may be more rapid when there is malabsorption of fat.</p>.<p><b>Endocrine diseases:</b> Several endocrine diseases (imbalances of hormones) may cause diarrhea, for example, an over-active thyroid gland (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hyperthyroidism</a>) and an under-active pituitary or adrenal gland (Addison's disease).</p>.<p><b>Laxative abuse:</b> The abuse of laxatives by individuals who want attention or to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">lose weight</a> is an occasional cause of chronic diarrhea.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_you_call_a_doctor_for_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most episodes of diarrhea are mild and of short duration and do not need to be brought to the attention of a doctor.

(See the prior discussion of common causes of chronic diarrhea.)</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_of_diarrhea_in_infants_and_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most acute diarrhea in infants and young children is due to viral gastroenteritis and is usually short-lived. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed for viral gastroenteritis. However, fever, vomiting, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loose stools</a> can be symptoms of other childhood infections such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">otitis media</a> (infection of the middle ear), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bladder infection</a>, sepsis (bacterial infection in the blood) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meningitis</a>. These illnesses may require early antibiotic treatment.</p>.<p>Infants with acute diarrhea also can quickly become severely dehydrated and therefore need early rehydration. For these reasons, sick infants with diarrhea should be evaluated by their pediatricians to identify and treat underlying infections as well as to provide instructions on the proper use of oral rehydration products.</p>.<p>Infants with moderate to severe dehydration usually are treated with intravenous fluids in the hospital. The pediatrician may decide to treat infants who are mildly dehydrated due to viral gastroenteritis at home with oral rehydration solutions.</p>.<p>Infants that are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breastfed</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">formula-fed</a> should continue to receive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">breast milk</a> during the rehydration phase of their illness if not prevented by vomiting. During, and for a short time after recovering from viral gastroenteritis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a> can be lactose intolerant due to a temporary deficiency of the enzyme, lactase (necessary to digest the lactose in milk) in the small intestine. Infants with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactose_intolerance/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lactose intolerance</a> can develop worsening diarrhea and cramps when dairy products are introduced. Therefore, after rehydration with oral rehydration solutions, an undiluted lactose-free formula and diluted juices are recommended. Milk products can be gradually increased as the infant improves.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_diarrhea_in_older_children_and_adults" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During mild cases of diarrhea, diluted fruit juices, soft <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">drinks</a> containing sugar, sports drinks such as Gatorade and water can be used to prevent dehydration. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Caffeine</a> and lactose containing dairy products should be temporarily avoided since they can aggravate diarrhea, the latter primarily in individuals with transient lactose intolerance. If there is no nausea and vomiting, solid foods should be continued. Foods that usually are well tolerated during a diarrheal illness include rice, cereal, bananas, potatoes, and lactose-free products.</p>.<p>Oral rehydration solutions can be used for moderately severe diarrhea that is accompanied by dehydration in children older than 10 years of age and in adults. These solutions are given at 50 ml/kg over 4-6 hours for mild dehydration or 100 ml/kg over 6 hours for moderate dehydration. After rehydration, the oral rehydration solution can be used to maintain hydration at 100 ml to 200 ml/kg over 24 hours until the diarrhea stops. Directions on the solution label usually state the amounts that are appropriate. After rehydration, older children and adults should resume solid food as soon as any nausea and vomiting subside. Solid food should begin with rice, cereal, bananas, potatoes, and lactose free and low fat products. The variety of foods can be expanded as the diarrhea subsides.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_home_remedies_help_the_symptoms_of_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many home remedies have been suggested for the treatment of diarrhea; however, few of them have been well studied.

Attapulgite and polycarbophil remain in the intestine and, therefore, have no side effects outside of the gastrointestinal tract. They may occasionally cause constipation and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/why_am_i_so_bloated/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bloating</a>. One concern is that absorbents also can bind medications and interfere with their absorption into the body. For this reason, it often is recommended that medications and absorbents be taken several hours apart so that they are physically separated within the intestines.</p>.<p>Anti-motility medications are drugs that relax the muscles of the small intestine and/or the colon. Relaxation results in slower flow of intestinal contents. Slower flow allows more time for water to be absorbed from the intestine and colon and reduces the water content of stool. Cramps, due to spasm of the intestinal muscles, also are relieved by the muscular relaxation.</p>.<p>The two main anti-motility medications are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loperamide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">loperamide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loperamide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Imodium</a>), which is available without a prescription, and diphenoxylate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenoxylate_and_atropine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lomotil</a>), which requires a prescription. Both medications are related to opiates (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/codeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">codeine</a>) but neither has the pain-relieving effects of opiates.</p>.<p>Loperamide (Imodium), though related to opiates, does not cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">addiction</a>.</p>.<p>Diphenoxylate is a man-made medication that at high doses can be addictive because of its opiate-like, euphoric (mood-elevating) effects. In order to prevent abuse of diphenoxylate and addiction, a second medication, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atropine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">atropine</a>, is added to loperamide in Lomotil. If too much Lomotil is ingested, unpleasant side effects from too much atropine will occur.</p>.<p>Loperamide and diphenoxylate are safe and well tolerated. There are some precautions, however, that should be observed.</p>.<p>Many bismuth-containing preparations are available around the world. Bismuth subsalicylate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bismuth_subsalicylate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pepto-Bismol</a>) is available in the US. It contains two potentially active ingredients, bismuth and salicylate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a>). It is not clear how effective bismuth compounds are, except in traveler's diarrhea and the treatment of <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/helicobacter_pylori_h_pylori_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">H. pylori</a></i> infection of the stomach where they have been shown to be effective. It also is not clear how bismuth subsalicylate might work. It is thought to have some antibiotic-like properties that affect bacteria that cause diarrhea. The salicylate is anti-inflammatory and could reduce secretion of water by reducing inflammation. Bismuth also might directly reduce the secretion of water by the intestine.</p>.<p>Pepto-Bismol is well tolerated. Minor side effects include darkening of the stool and tongue. Several precautions that should be observed when using Pepto-Bismol.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_types_of_doctors_treat_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gastroenterologists are the specialists who usually manage patients with diarrhea and pursue the diagnosis of its cause, particularly when the diarrhea is chronic.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_diarrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dehydration occurs when there is excessive loss of fluids and minerals (electrolytes) from the body due to diarrhea, with or without vomiting.</p>.<p>Electrolytes (minerals) are lost with water when diarrhea is prolonged or severe, and mineral or electrolyte deficiencies may occur. The most common deficiencies occur with sodium and potassium. Abnormalities of chloride and bicarbonate also may develop.</p>.<p>Finally, there may be irritation of the anus due to the frequent passage of watery stool containing irritating substances.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_dehydration_from_diarrhea_be_prevented_and_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are liquids that contain a carbohydrate (glucose or rice syrup) and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride, and citrate or bicarbonate). Originally, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the WHO-ORS to rapidly rehydrate victims of the severe diarrheal illness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholera/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholera</a>. The WHO-ORS solution contains glucose and electrolytes. The glucose in the solution is important because it forces the small intestine to quickly absorb the fluid and the electrolytes. The purpose of the electrolytes in the solution is the prevention and treatment of electrolyte deficiencies.</p>.<p>In the U.S., convenient, premixed commercial ORS products that are similar to the WHO-ORS are available for rehydration and prevention of dehydration. Examples of these products are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolyte_solution-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pedialyte</a>, Rehydralyte, Infalyte, and Resol.</p>.<p>Most of the commercially available ORS products in the U.S. contain glucose. Infalyte is the only one that contains rice carbohydrate instead of glucose. Most doctors believe that there are no important differences in effectiveness between glucose and rice carbohydrate.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
