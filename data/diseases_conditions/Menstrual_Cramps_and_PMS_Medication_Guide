Menstrual cramps usually start shortly before the menstrual period, peak within 24 hours after their onset, and subside after a day or two.</p>.<p>Menstrual cramps can range from mild to severe. Mild menstrual cramps may be barely noticeable and short-lived, and they are sometimes felt only as a sense of mild pressure in the abdomen and pelvis. Severe menstrual cramps can be so painful that they interfere with a woman's regular activities for several days. The discomfort can extend to the lower back or legs. Menstrual cramps are not the same as the symptoms experienced due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premenstrual</a> syndrome (PMS), although the symptoms of both disorders can sometimes be experienced together. Many women suffer from both PMS and menstrual cramps.</p>.<p>Medical research of menstrual cramps has shown that they are often worse in women who began menstruating early and who have long menstrual periods with heavy menstrual flow. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Smoking</a> and a family history of severe menstrual cramps are also associated with severe dysmenorrhea.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_common_menstrual_cramps_primary_dysmenorrhea" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment options vary and each woman needs to find a treatment that works best for her. Non-drug measures that may help include adequate rest and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>, regular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> (especially walking), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> cessation. Some women find that abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/massage_therapy/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">massage</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yoga/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">yoga</a>, or orgasmic sexual activity can help. A heating pad applied to the abdominal area may also relieve the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>.</p>.<p>For mild menstrual cramps, over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tylenol</a>), or acetaminophen plus a diuretic (such as Diurex MPR, Midol, Pamprin, Premesyn) may help. However, aspirin has a limited effect in curbing the production of prostaglandin and is only useful for mild cramps. For moderate menstrual cramps, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful. The NSAIDs are more effective than aspirin in inhibiting the production and action of the prostaglandins. NSAIDs that are available OTC are:</p>.<p>For optimal control of menstrual cramps, a woman should start taking a NSAID before her <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> becomes difficult to control. This might mean starting medication 1 to 2 days before her period is due to begin and continuing taking medication 1 to 2 days into her period. The best results are obtained by taking one of the NSAIDs on a regular schedule rather than on an as needed basis. Therefore, ibuprofen should be taken every 4-6 hours, ketoprofen every 4-8 hours, and naproxen every 8-12 hours for the first few days of the menstrual flow.</p>.<p>Prescription NSAIDs available for the treatment of menstrual cramps include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mefenamic_acid-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mefenamic acid</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mefenamic_acid-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ponstel</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_premenstrual_syndrome_pms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of emotional, physical, psychological, and mood disturbances that occur after a woman's ovulation and normally end with the onset of her menstrual flow.</p>.<p>PMS remains a puzzle because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories has been proven and specific treatments for PMS largely lack a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from alterations in or interactions among the levels of sex hormones and brain chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatments_are_available_for_pms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of PMS can sometimes be as challenging as diagnosing the condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women. Other treatments with a sound scientific basis may not help all patients. General measures include:</p>.<p>Research studies have linked a deficiency of calcium and magnesium to PMS; therefore, it may be beneficial for woman to try <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">supplements</a> of these nutrients at recommended dosages.
