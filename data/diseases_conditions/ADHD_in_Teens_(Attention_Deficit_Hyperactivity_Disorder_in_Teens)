Current research is utilizing powerful neuroimaging techniques (for example, functional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a>) and has developed intriguing hypotheses of neurochemical dysfunction of the brain as a cause of ADHD behaviors. Regions of the brain felt to be responsible for executive functioning, problem solving, as well as goal seeking and impulsivity may function differently in those individuals with ADHD when compared to those without the diagnosis. Interestingly, regions of the brain not felt to be associated with ADHD behaviors may also be different when individuals with ADHD are compared to people not experiencing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">ADHD symptoms</a>. While these theories may have interesting research implications, a more conventional approach utilizes both a mental-health evaluation and a thorough physical examination in determining the diagnosis of ADHD and providing a rational treatment program. There is clear evidence of a hereditary predisposition toward ADHD. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Children with ADHD</a> are more likely to have a parent or nonidentical twin sibling with the same diagnosis. An even higher likelihood exists when considering identical twins.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_adhd_in_teens_are_there_adhd_tests" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary to establishing a diagnosis of ADHD is the demonstration of symptoms detailed in the criteria of the <i>DSM-V</i>. Collecting information from both parents and teachers is crucial. Various rating scales (for example, Connors Scales) are objective and efficient to complete. Part of the evaluation for an individual for possible ADHD involves a thorough search for other associated (but not causative) mental health disorders including (but not limited to) learning disorders, mood disorders, and more. By definition, it is crucial to exclude other causes of the ADHD symptom complex. This umbrella may include</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_adhd_in_teens" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Several of the behaviors displayed in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">childhood ADHD</a> carry through to the teen and even adult years. The manifestations may be more subtle and/or "hidden" due to the more mature coping mechanisms as well as the need to adapt to the expected behavior society demands with more advanced age. Studies have noted the following list of potential symptoms for adolescent ADHD patients:</p>.<p>Besides the obvious and expected academic and social problems these behaviors may engender, there is other "fallout" which may have even more severe consequences. These may include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_adhd_in_teens_affect_executive_function" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The frontal lobes of the brain are located directly behind the forehead and are not felt to be functionally fully mature until an individual is 22-25 years of age. A major role of this brain region is to provide executive function. While older teens generally do not have fully matured frontal lobes, adolescents with ADHD may carry an extra burden of less maturity of this region and thus have even more problems with executive function.</p>.<p>The basic task of executive function is to facilitate formulation and execution of a plan to achieve a goal. Executive function involves the ability to manage several tasks. These include time management, ignoring unnecessary (extraneous) information, switching focus from one task to another, prioritizing, planning and organizing tasks to achieve a goal, remembering details, controlling inappropriate speech and/or behaviors, and integrating past experiences with the current task at hand. Specialists in human behavior subdivide executive function into two elements:</p>.<p>An example of utilizing executive function might take place at dessert time in a restaurant. A large piece of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chocolate_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">chocolate</a> cake is enticing, and the memory of prior pieces of chocolate cake provides a temptation (organization). However, remembering the excessive amount of calories the cake provides and your desire to lose 5 pounds enables you to skip dessert (regulation).</p>.<p>Teens with poorly managed executive function will commonly have problems with planning projects, memorizing information and integrating it into a subject area, estimating the time necessary to complete a project, and initiating and coordinating activities or tasks.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_kinds_of_difficulties_do_teens_with_adhd_face" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Teenagers with ADHD will commonly have problems with relationships (parents and peers), academic and nonacademic (for example, sports and employment) success, and self-esteem. It is important to include the teen when discussing management of his or her ADHD. Accepting the diagnosis of ADHD can be a major hurdle. A teen's sense of self-identity requires fitting in seamlessly with peers; this goal of blending in may be disrupted and the adolescent may feel that he or she has been "labeled" and thus ostracized. Helping the teen to appreciate his or her strengths and that there are options which will help to "level the playing field" will actually enable him or her to better fit in with their non-ADHD affected peers. The analogy of wearing glasses may help to make the point. The glasses merely enable the wearer to see as well as those whose vision is not impacted. Management of ADHD is merely designed to return the teen back to the baseline his or her contemporaries currently experience.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_nonmedical_treatment_strategies_for_teen_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nonmedical management strategies for the adolescent with ADHD include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_stimulant_medications_are_available_to_treat_adhd_in_teens" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Several studies have clearly established that pharmacologic (drug) therapy for ADHD is superior to behavioral therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. Combining medication and behavioral therapy is less likely to improve behavioral outcomes over medication alone unless patients are also experiencing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anxiety</a> or oppositional defiant disorder. The first category of therapeutic medications is chemically classified as "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a>." Studies have established that 80% of patients with ADHD will have a positive response to their use and this therapy is generally well tolerated. Medications come in short- (three to four hour), medium- (five to six hour), and long-lasting (eight to 14 hour) formulations. The two most common medications are</p>.<p>Stimulant medications that are in liquid (Quillivant-XR and Dyanavel) or in patch form (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylphenidate_patch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Daytrana</a>) are now available, allowing children who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swallowing/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">difficulty swallowing</a> pills to benefit from medication. Both the methylphenidate and amphetamine classes of stimulants are felt to positively affect the neurochemical transmitters of the brain that moderate attention, arousal, and impulse control.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_potential_side_effects_of_stimulant_medications_for_teens_with_adhd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Side effects may include appetite suppression, irritability, inhibited personality, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">depression</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> issues. Rarely, patients may develop tics and very rarely patients develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">hallucinations</a> while taking stimulant medications. Studies show that short-term use of stimulants (up to three years) may contribute to a mild slowing of the rate of height acquisition; however, the ultimate acquired height when considering long-term use is not thought to be affected. Recently, there have been concerns regarding the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients treated with stimulants. A recent policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that several elements be evaluated prior to initiating therapy with stimulant medications.</p>.<p>A growing concern in high school and college involves students selling their stimulant medication to non-ADHD peers. These students harbor the false belief that taking such medication will boost their study skills and thus boost their academic performance.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_non-stimulant_medications_are_available_to_treat_adhd_in_teens" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Non-stimulant medications are generally considered to be second line in the treatment of ADHD. They are generally found to be more subtle in their effectiveness compared to stimulant-class medications. One of the primary non-stimulant medications prescribed is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atomoxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">atomoxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atomoxetine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Strattera</a>). Other non-stimulant medications that have been found to be helpful in treating ADHD include those that are also used as cardiac medications like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guanfacine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">guanfacine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guanfacine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tenex</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guanfacine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Intuniv</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">clonidine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine_kapvay_extended-release/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Kapvay</a>).</p>.<p>A disadvantage to such medications is that they may take up to six weeks for atomoxetine and one to four weeks for guanfacine and clonidine to achieve an effective dosage. As a consequence, taking "drug holidays" (for example, winter break) is not as feasible as it is when a patient is utilizing a member of the stimulant class of medications. Side effects of atomoxetine may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/decreased_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">decreased appetite</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">upset stomach</a>, and sleepiness.
