<p><b><a name="what_is_tonometry" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tonometry is a method of measuring the pressure in the eye by measuring the tone or firmness of its surface.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_intraocular_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tonometry is very useful to doctors for measurement of the pressure in the eye, or the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intraocular pressure</a> (IOP). An elevated IOP can be dangerous because people with varying degrees of IOP elevation may develop damage to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">optic nerve</a>. The optic nerve collects all of the visual information from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">retina</a> of the eye and transmits that information to the brain, where the signals are interpreted as vision. When changes occur in the optic nerve leading to decreased peripheral vision and loss of the nerve tissues, a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glaucoma</a> can be made.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/glaucoma_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Glaucoma</a> is a fairly common condition. Many people with glaucoma have not been checked and therefore do not know that they have it. Thus, glaucoma screening efforts as well as regular eye examinations are essential to detect glaucoma at the earliest possible stages.</p>.<p>Glaucoma is usually, but not always, associated with elevated pressure in the eye Actually, glaucoma is now considered a disease of the optic nerve, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">optic neuropathy</a>. Generally speaking, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vision loss</a> in glaucoma usually occurs in both eyes, and is thus termed bilateral. As in many other disease states, the vision loss may not be symmetric, that is, one eye may be worse than the other. Vision loss due to glaucoma often begins with a subtle decrease in peripheral vision. If the glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it may progress to loss of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">central vision</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a>.</p>.<p>Vision loss in the chronic open-angle form of glaucoma generally occurs gradually over many years, while the vision loss of acute angle closure glaucoma may occur within a matter of days if not immediately treated. Since patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">open-angle glaucoma</a> rarely notice their gradual peripheral visual field loss, they may not visit an eye doctor until advanced changes have occurred. Unfortunately, the visual field loss in glaucoma represents permanent damage to the optic nerve and is therefore irreversible. For this reason, glaucoma is often called the sneak thief of sight.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_for_glaucoma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Glaucoma occurs when the normal fluid in the front of the eye chamber, the aqueous humor, is blocked from leaving the eye during the normal aqueous turnover process. This blockage can occur for a number of reasons, the most common of which is simply poor outflow due to chronic open-angle glaucoma. A number of other problems can also impede the ability of the outflow channels to function properly, thus creating elevated IOP. Glaucoma is rarely if ever a disease of excessive aqueous humor production. An eye doctor, your ophthalmologist or optometrist, can usually detect those individuals who are at risk for glaucoma. These patients are called "glaucoma suspects" and must be monitored closely for subtle changes in their visual field or in their optic nerve.</p>.<p>There are many risk factors for glaucoma, including:</p>.<p>The eye doctor also can diagnose patients who already have glaucoma by observing their nerve for damage or detecting visual field loss with a peripheral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/visual_field_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">visual field test</a>. Patients with glaucoma must be monitored closely for the remainder of their lifetime in order to adequately treat the IOP and assess treatment effectiveness. It is extremely cost effective to avoid visual disability due to glaucoma, enabling the at-risk patient or the patient with glaucoma to have an active lifestyle with functional central and peripheral vision.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_tonometry_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tonometry is generally performed upon an anesthetized ocular surface.  Anesthesia is generally rendered with a single drop of topical anesthetic, such as proparicaine (Alcaine) or tetracaine (Pontocaine).  The tonometer device lightly touches the surface of the eye, ever so slightly indenting the cornea.  The resistance to indentation is measured by a precisely calibrated pressure sensing device, the tonometer.  Several types of tonometers are available for this test, the most common being the applanation tonometer:</p>.<p>After the eye has been numbed by the technician or doctor with anesthetic eye drops, the tonometer's sensor is placed against the surface of the eye.  The firmer the tone of the surface of the eye, the higher the pressure reading.  The doctor can record the pressure reading, and this can be used to diagnose or monitor the treatment of glaucoma.  Also, the pressure reading is lower than otherwise expected if the cornea is thin.  Thus, patients with a thin cornea may obtain a falsely low IOP reading when the actual pressure is high.  These patients must be watched more closely for glaucoma.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_tonometry_used_for" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tonometry is an essential component of the global examination in all eye check-ups and specifically for a glaucoma examination. A complete glaucoma examination has a number of important components.</p>.<p>These tests together give a complete picture of the patient's ocular health and therefore the risks for developing or controlling a given disease such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cataracts</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/macular_degeneration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">macular degeneration</a>, or glaucoma. The following tests make up a glaucoma examination:</p>.<p>Once the examinations have been completed, a decision is made as to whether or not glaucoma treatment should be given, maintained at its current level, or modified. If the patient is doing well, then glaucoma treatment may be withheld or cut back. If the patient is doing poorly, then more treatment may be recommended. There are several approaches to glaucoma treatment, any or all of which may be appropriate for a given patient. These include but are not limited to the following:</p>.<p>The bottom line for any patient, and particularly the patient who might be at risk for glaucoma, is to have regular visits to your eye doctor. Patients over the age of 50, or patients at risk of glaucoma over the age of 40, should have regular annual eye examinations.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
