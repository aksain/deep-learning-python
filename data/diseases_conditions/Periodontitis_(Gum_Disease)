<p><b><a name="what_is_gum_disease_gingivitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gum disease, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_health_common_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">gingivitis</a>, is inflammation of the tissues surrounding and supporting the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">teeth</a> and is most commonly a result of poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_oral_health_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">dental hygiene</a>. Gingivitis is a very common condition and varies widely in severity. It is characterized by red, swollen gums that bleed easily when teeth are brushed or flossed. Gingivitis is not the same thing as periodontitis, although sometimes a person may be affected by both.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_difference_between_gingivitis_and_periodontal_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While gingivitis is inflammation of the <i>gums</i> around the teeth, periodontal disease occurs when the <i>bone</i> below the gums gets inflamed or infected.</p>.<p>Gingivitis starts when food debris mixes with saliva and bacteria-forming plaque that sticks on the surfaces of teeth. If dental plaque and tartar aren't removed by brushing with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/choosing_a_toothpaste/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">toothpaste</a> and flossing, it can become mineralized and form tartar, or calculus. Tartar is very hard and can only be removed by a professional dental cleaning.</p>.<p>Both dental plaque and tartar are filled with harmful bacteria, and if they aren't removed from teeth, they will begin to irritate the gums and cause gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis will often extend from the gums to the bone and lead to periodontitis. When the underlying bone gets infected, it will start to recede away from the teeth and form deep gum pockets. These pockets collect plaque and bacteria as they are very difficult to keep clean, and more bone loss occurs. As periodontal disease progresses into later stages and more bone tissue is lost, the teeth may eventually become loose and fall out.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gum disease is mostly caused by improper oral hygiene that allows bacteria in plaque and calculus to remain on the teeth and infect the gums. But there are other factors that increase the risk of developing gingivitis. Some of the most common risk factors are as follows:</p>.<p><b><a name="does_gum_disease_cause_bad_breath" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bad_breath/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Bad breath</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bad_breath/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">halitosis</a>, is most frequently associated with a condition of the mouth like gum disease. As the bacteria that are normally present in the mouth break down plaque and tartar, they release chemicals that have a strong odor. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bad_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Bad breath</a> can also come from plaque that builds up on the tongue. As the plaque and tartar are removed from the teeth and tongue with regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings, the halitosis can be eliminated. This is the easiest way to reverse bad breath, but it can take a while for the mouth odor to completely disappear. A person needs to be consistent and persistent with oral hygiene to reverse the condition.</p>.<p>Other causes of bad breath include partially erupted <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wisdom_teeth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">wisdom teeth</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a>, mouth breathing, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/postnasal_drip_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">postnasal drip</a>, infections in the throat or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/tonsil_stones_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">tonsil stones</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">smoking</a>, digestive problems, and systemic diseases like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_gum_disease_look_like_what_are_gum_disease_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A person with gingivitis will typically have one or more of the following signs and symptoms:</p>.<p>As gingivitis progresses (chronic gingivitis), various complications may arise. The affected person may develop receding gums or areas where the root of the tooth becomes uncovered by the shrinking, diseased gums. Deep pockets may develop around the teeth that trap food, plaque, and debris. If gingivitis advances to periodontal disease, the person may lose gum tissue or bone around the teeth and the teeth may become loose or fall out. These changes can develop either very slowly or very rapidly and can affect either a few teeth or the entire mouth. If oral hygiene is almost never done or if the person becomes immune-compromised, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis may develop (ANUG, formerly termed trench mouth). This is a painful condition where infected gums swell, ulcerate, and slough off dead tissue.</p>.<p>It is possible to have gingivitis and not notice any signs or symptoms, so regular visits to the dentist are vital in determining a patient's specific risk level. The dentist is the primary-care provider of the mouth and will be able to provide all of the facts and information necessary in diagnosing the disease and taking steps in curing or reversing gum disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health-care_professionals_diagnose_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following methods and symptoms are very useful in the diagnosis of gum disease:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment goals for gingivitis are to identify and eliminate the factors that are making the person more susceptible to gum disease. Most factors can be eliminated by establishing more consistent and thorough oral hygiene habits and professional dental cleanings. If there are certain risk factors such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">smoking</a> or uncontrolled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a> that are contributing to the gum disease, they need to be addressed or eliminated to have success in reversing gingivitis. After the plaque and tartar are removed by a dentist or hygienist, the patient can usually cure gum disease by brushing and flossing after every meal and using a daily mouth rinse. Under the supervision of a dentist, a patient can use 10% carbamide peroxide in a custom made tray that fits over the teeth with positive effects on plaque control and gingival health. This is especially helpful in patients where conventional oral hygiene practices like brushing and flossing are impaired due to age or special needs.</p>.<p>In cases where gingivitis has led to periodontal disease and there are deep pockets that are difficult to clean, the patient may require deep scaling and root planing to clean teeth that are surrounded by deep pockets. They may need surgical treatment to gain access to all the tooth surfaces for a thorough cleaning. This surgical procedure is called flap surgery and can be combined with a pocket-reduction surgery to make the areas around the teeth easier for the patient to clean with brushing and flossing. This procedure consists of numbing the gums and then lifting them back to clean the teeth and sometimes reshape the bone. The gums are then repositioned around the teeth so there aren't the deep pockets that existed before treatment.</p>.<p>Soft-tissue grafts are used to cover up root surfaces that have been exposed by receding gums. This can help eliminate sensitive teeth and protect the root surfaces that are softer and more difficult to clean.</p>.<p>Laser therapy is another treatment to help increase gum health. The gum pocket is treated with a soft tissue laser to eliminate the harmful bacteria deep in the periodontal pockets, remove unhealthy tissue and help stimulate healing.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_specialists_treat_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Periodontists are dentists who have completed additional training after dental school focused entirely on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of disease of the gum and bone surrounding the teeth. In advanced cases of gingivitis or periodontal disease, a general dentist may recommend a gross debridement of superficial plaque and tartar and will then refer the affected patient to a periodontist for evaluation. Periodontists may recommend a variety of nonsurgical or surgical procedures to help stabilize the gum condition. Periodontists are also very skilled at performing treatments of other conditions of the gums and bone including gum and bone grafts, functional and esthetic gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, implants, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">crown</a> lengthening.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_medication_are_used_to_treat_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Antibiotic therapy can be combined in various ways to help treat gingivitis, periodontal disease, and especially ANUG. Chlorhexidine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chlorhexidine-topicalmucous_membrane/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Peridex</a>) is an antibiotic mouthwash that can be used under direction of a dentist to help reduce the bacteria that cause gum disease. Pellets or gels like PerioChip that contain the antibiotic chlorhexidine or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxycycline/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">doxycycline</a> can be placed in deep gum pockets after deep scaling and root planing to kill stubborn bacteria and reduce the size of periodontal pockets. These modes of delivering antibiotic therapy are very effective because the antibiotic is released slowly over the course of about seven days. Additional treatment such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">xylocaine</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a> may be needed for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pain</a> control in chronic gingivitis and ANUG.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_home_remedies_or_natural_treatments_effective_for_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There has been evidence to suggest the effectiveness of the following over-the-counter and natural treatments for gum disease:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_reverse_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As long as the causes of gum disease are correctly identified and the patient is persistent in improving their oral hygiene and seeking necessary treatment, gum disease can be reversible. The prognosis is best when treatment is obtained in early stages of gingivitis. At this stage, the affected person usually just needs a professional dental cleaning and more thorough brushing and flossing to reverse disease. As the condition turns from acute to chronic (chronic gingivitis), and from gingivitis to periodontitis or to ANUG, the prognosis gets less predictable. Therefore, it is very important to catch and treat gum disease as early as possible.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_gum_disease_associated_with_other_health_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There have been many attempts to understand the link between gum disease and other systemic health problems such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>, and Alzheimer's disease. Comparing the bacteria that cause dental plaque with the bacteria involved in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">heart disease</a> suggests a correlation between gum disease and heart disease, but researchers have been unable to establish a cause and effect relationship. These types of relationships are difficult to prove or disprove, so it is fair to assume that aiming for a life free of gum disease will only help in leading a generally healthier life.</p>.<p>While it may be hard to prove what health problems gum disease directly causes, it is known that certain health problems can cause gum disease. If there are any sudden changes to a person's medical condition, they should ask their primary-care provider or dentist if there might be any effects on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_oral_health_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">oral health</a>. Healthy gums can quickly become threatened when the body's overall health diminishes or changes for any reason.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_gum_disease_managed_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A child should start having his or her teeth brushed with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste beginning at 12 months of age. As soon as the gaps between the teeth start to close, it is important to start flossing. At the beginning, the parents should establish a routine to brush the teeth so the child can get used to it. As soon as the child is able, the brushing and flossing should be passed over to him or her and monitored by the parent to ensure good thorough technique and consistency. A child should get regular dental visits starting at about 2 years of age. Abiding by these guidelines will effectively prevent and treat gum disease in most children.</p>.<p>It is common for there to be an increase in gingivitis during puberty due to the hormonal changes that occur throughout the body. Adolescents should be monitored for good oral hygiene habits and taken to the dentist regularly to treat gum disease with professional dental cleanings.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_gum_disease_managed_in_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many women who become <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> think that they should avoid the dentist to keep their pregnancy safe, but they shouldn't miss their dental cleanings as long as they feel strong and comfortable enough. During pregnancy, women are at risk of developing pregnancy gingivitis. Because of the increase in hormones that occurs with pregnancy, the gum tissues are more susceptible to attack from bacteria and other pathogens. Pregnant women will often notice an increase in swollen, bleeding gums even if their oral hygiene has remained consistent. It may be necessary to get dental cleanings more often than usual during pregnancy to help combat this increased risk.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prevention of gingivitis and periodontal disease is very simple in most cases. Gum disease is best prevented through proper plaque control. This involves brushing to remove plaque from the outer surfaces of the teeth and flossing to remove food particles and plaque from in between the teeth. Electronic toothbrushes tend to make it easier to remove plaque from some of the harder to reach areas of the mouth. Using a mouthwash after brushing and flossing can also help by reducing the bacteria that cause gingivitis.</p>.<p>Besides these basic oral hygiene practices, there are other things that can be done to eliminate the factors that lead to an increase in gum disease:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_best_toothpaste_to_use_to_prevent_gum_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The goal of toothbrushing is to remove plaque on the teeth that will harbor bacteria and cause gum disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tooth decay</a>. Just about any toothpaste when used with consistent thorough brushing habits will accomplish this goal. There are some ingredients in toothpastes that help remove plaque more effectively and help keep plaque off the teeth after they have been brushed. The abrasive agents in toothpaste such as silicates and calcium carbonates help remove plaque that is a little sticky. Sodium lauryl sulfate is a detergent in toothpaste that causes the foaming effect of toothpastes. Toothpastes vary in the amount of SLS they contain; a high concentration of SLS can cause problems for patients who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dry mouth</a> or low saliva flow. Some toothpastes include plaque-control agents such as pyrophosphates and zinc citrate that prevent plaque from sticking to the teeth after they've been brushed. Using a toothpaste that contains any combination of these ingredients will increase the effectiveness of oral hygiene.</p>.<p>Furthermore, rinsing with an essential-oil containing dentifrice (mouthwash) for 30 seconds twice daily after brushing helps prevent plaque buildup even more.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_gum_disease_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While most of the factors that lead to gingivitis and periodontal disease are dependent on the individual, there has been some limited scientific evidence to affirm that gingivitis and periodontitis-causing bacteria can be passed down from parents to children and between couples.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
