<p><b><a name="dizziness_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="introduction_to_dizziness_feeling_dizzy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dizziness is one of the most common symptoms that will prompt a person to seek medical care. The term dizziness is sometimes difficult to understand since it means different things to different people. It is either the sensation of feeling lightheaded as if the individual is weak and will pass out, or it describes vertigo or the sensation of spinning, as if the affected person just got off a merry-go-round.</p>.<p>Lightheadedness is often caused by a decrease in blood supply to the brain, while vertigo may be caused by disturbances of the inner ear and the balance centers of the brain. It is important that the health care provider understand the complaint the person is experiencing. That is the first important step so that the proper direction can be taken to find a diagnosis and begin treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While classifying dizziness into lightheadedness and vertigo categories may help understand how the body works, sometimes it is worthwhile to review common reasons why people might complain of dizziness.</p>.<p><b><a name="low_blood_pressure_as_a_cause_of_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, and the feeling of passing out is a common complaint in people who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure_hypotension_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low blood pressure</a>. When the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> is too low, not enough oxygen-rich blood is being delivered to the brain, and its function can be affected. If the brain's blood supply is decreased too much, the person may pass out (syncope). Symptoms may worsen when changing position from lying down or sitting, to standing up.</p>.<p>In addition to feeling dizzy, associated symptoms may include:</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/low_blood_pressure_hypotension_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Low blood pressure</a> may be the result of an underlying illness or disease, or it may be a normal physiologic condition. Some common reasons for low blood pressure include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="postural_or_orthostatic_hypotension_as_a_cause_of_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In individuals who are dehydrated or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemic</a>, blood pressure readings may be normal when they are lying flat; however, the lack of fluid is unmasked when they stand up quickly. The lack of blood to the brain may cause dizziness and lightheadedness. This feeling may pass in a few seconds as the body adapts. However, if dehydration or medications (for example, beta blockers) prevent the body from reacting by constricting blood vessels and increasing the heart rate, the dizziness may persist to the point at which the patient passes out (faints, or experiences syncope).</p>.<p>Some diseases are associated with an inability to compensate for changes in body position (autonomic dysfunction). Normally when a person stands, blood vessels contract to increase blood pressure slightly, and the heart rate increases to pump blood uphill to the brain against gravity. In autonomic dysfunction, a person may become dizzy when they move from a lying position to sitting or standing up. Examples of these diseases include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>,  Addison's disease, or  Parkinson's disease).</p>.<p>Orthostatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypotension</a> is a common symptom with Shy-Drager syndrome. Shy-Drager syndrome is a rare disease in which the autonomic nervous system degenerates and cannot provide the routine control mechanisms for the body including heart rate, blood pressure, and bowel and bladder function.</p>.<p><b><a name="high_blood_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">High blood pressure</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>, is known as the "silent killer" since it often has no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings are markedly elevated. On occasion, a person may complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, or dizziness, although the complaints don't necessarily correlate with the degree of blood pressure elevation.</p>.<p>However, if the blood pressure is elevated and the person has symptoms, there is a need to bring the blood pressure under control relatively quickly. The more severe the symptoms, the quicker blood pressure control needs to be achieved. For example, if a person is having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke symptoms</a> associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>, the blood pressure needs to be controlled immediately (hypertensive emergency).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="diabetes_as_a_cause_of_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dizziness is a common complaint in persons with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, and may be caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypoglycemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low blood sugar</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypoglycemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypoglycemia</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperglycemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood sugar</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperglycemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperglycemia</a>), or autonomic dysfunction (see previous section).</p>.<p><b><a name="endocrine_diseases_which_cause_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="hyperventilation_%0Aas_a_cause_of_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the body may use hyperventilation or rapid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a> to help with acid-base balance, it may also occur as a response to an emotionally stressful situation. In hyperventilation syndrome, the rapid breathing eliminates some of the body's carbon dioxide, leading to a tingling sensation in the hands and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a>, and around the mouth. Dizziness and lightheadedness are associated symptoms. The symptoms may increase the perceived emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> and cause even more hyperventilation. In severe hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels drop enough to cause carpopedal spasm, in which the hands and feet become claw-like and difficult to move. Symptoms of hyperventilation resolve relatively quickly once the breathing rate returns to normal.</p>.<p>Hyperventilation is not always an emotional response.

Hyperventilation is also present whenever the body becomes acidotic; the rapid breathing is one correction method that the body uses to regulate its acid-base balance.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="heart_conditions_which_cause_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The heart is an electrical pump and for it to work, the electrical conduction system must be operating properly to stimulate the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart muscle</a> to squeeze in a coordinated fashion and pump blood to the body. The heart muscle itself must be strong enough to pump blood, and the valves in the heart must work properly to allow blood to flow in the direction intended during contraction.</p>.<p><b><a name="vasovagal_syncope_%0Aas_a_cause_of_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of dizziness, lightheadedness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fainting</a>. The vagus nerve is overstimulated and causes the body's blood vessels to dilate and the heart to slow down. This anti-adrenaline effect decreases the ability of the heart to pump blood upward toward the brain. Without blood flow, the brain turns off. In Victorian England, young ladies' sensibilities were easily offended causing a vasovagal episode called a swoon.</p>.<p>Some people faint at the sight of blood. Some parents faint when their child gets immunized. Some medical students faint at their first <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autopsy</a>. Many types of emotional and physical stressors can overstimulate the vagus nerve, causing dizziness, lightheadedness, and at times fainting (passing out).</p>.<p>Fainting is not normal. If a person is unconscious, the emergency medical system should be activated (call 911 if available), and medical care should be sought.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="dizziness_and_vertigo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Vertigo is often described as feeling dizzy, or as a sensation of spinning. A person may specifically mention that the room seems to be spinning around them. Sometimes the complaint is loss of balance or loss of equilibrium. This often occurs because of irritation in the inner ear (the part of the ear that involves balance, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a>).</p>.<p>The inner ear has two parts that help the body determine its position in space relative to gravity; 1) the semicircular canals and 2) the vestibule.</p>.<p>There are three semicircular canals that are aligned at right angles to each other. These canals are filled with fluid and are lined with a nerve-filled, crystal-encrusted membrane that transmits information to the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination). The cerebellum collects information from the eyes (visual stimuli) and the nerve endings in muscles associated with proprioception (the perception of movement), to assist the brain in assessing where the body is in relationship to gravity every time one part of it moves.</p>.<p>Normally, when the head moves, fluid in the semicircular canals shifts, and that information is relayed to the brain. When the head stops moving, the fluid stops as well, and that information is relayed to the brain.</p>.<p>In some cases there may be a short delay in the transmission of this information to the brain. For example, when a person rides on a merry-go-round or spins quickly around in circles, the fluid in the canals develop momentum and though the body stops spinning, the fluid in the semicircular canals may continue to move. This causes vertigo, or a sensation of spinning, and may cause the person to fall or stumble. It also may be associated with vomiting. While kids try to provoke these are symptoms in play, they can be debilitating for an adult.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_experienced_when_a_person_feels_dizzy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_call_the_doctor_for_dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dizziness is a common complaint and often has resolved by the time the patient arrives to see a health care professional. Usually there is no rush to seek care. However, while the complaint of dizziness is not often an emergency, care should be sought immediately if it is accompanied by any of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_dizziness_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of dizziness begins with the health care professional deciding whether the complaint of dizziness refers to lightheadedness or vertigo. Further diagnosis continues once this distinction is made.</p>.<p>The key to the diagnosis of dizziness is a thorough history and physical examination. Often the diagnosis is made by listening to the patient's story. The health care professional may ask about triggers that cause and relieve the symptoms of dizziness.</p>.<p>A review of systems is a series of questions that review the patient's body functions. Questions may be asked about associated symptoms including fever, vomiting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>, chest <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, shortness of breath, palpitations, or abnormal bleeding.</p>.<p>The past medical history may be reviewed, and this includes reviewing medications the patient is currently taking.</p>.<p>A thorough physical examination will likely be done; this may include:</p>.<p><b>Vital signs:</b> Taking the patient's blood pressure and pulse rate lying down and standing (called orthostatic or postural vital signs) often will indicate the fluid status of the body. In patients who are dehydrated or bleeding, the blood pressure may fall and pulse rate may rise on changing position. However, patients taking medications like beta blockers will not generate an increased pulse rate.</p>.<p><b>Tailored physical examination:</b> Often, the physical examination is tailored to the patient based upon the information provided in the patient's medical history. For example, a woman with a heavy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual period</a> may need a pelvic examination, or a patient with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cough</a> and shortness of breath may need a closer examination of the heart and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>. A patient thought to have vertigo will have closer focus on the neurologic exam, including the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and coordination.</p>.<p><b>Imaging studies and blood tests:</b> The need for imaging studies and/or and blood tests will depend on the concerns the health care professional and patient have in regard to the cause of the dizziness. Common tests that may be ordered include:</p>.<p align="left">X-rays, CT scans, and  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a> may be indicated depending upon the patient's needs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_vertigo_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of vertigo is most often made based upon history and clinical presentation. If the patient is experiencing a spinning sensation that worsens by a change in position, and lessens by lying still, the health care professional can confirm the cause of dizziness as vertigo if there are appropriate findings on physical examination.</p>.<p>Further history may be taken to make certain that the symptom of vertigo is isolated to an inner ear condition and not due to a problem in the brain (for example, a stroke).</p>.<p><b>Neurological examination</b></p>.<p>Physical examination will focus on the neurologic examination and may involve looking at eye movements. With vertigo, nystagmus may be present. This is an involuntary movement of the eyes, slow and smooth in one direction with fast twitches in the other. It is the eyes' attempt to compensate for the abnormal signals being created in the inner ear. The patient may be asked to lay flat or sit upright to uncover the presence of nystagmus.</p>.<p>The patient's hearing may be tested to assess potential hearing loss. This may be seen in Meniere's disease or with an acoustic neuroma, but not necessarily with labyrinthitis or benign positional vertigo.</p>.<p>The rest of the neurologic examination may be done to look for one-sided weakness, loss of coordination, or loss of balance as potential signs of stroke.</p>.<p>Evaluation for BPPV or labyrinthitis is often complete at this point, although depending upon the health care professional's concerns, further testing may be indicated. Referral may be made to a physical therapist specially trained in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/balance_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vestibular</a> therapy for diagnosis confirmation and symptom relief.</p>.<p>If there is confusion as to the potential cause of vertigo, imaging of the brain may be needed. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) may be indicated since this test evaluates the cerebellum more accurately. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Computerized tomography</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>) may be used in an emergency to look for bleeding in the brain.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_dizziness_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Dizziness treatment</b></p>.<p>Dizziness is a symptom, not a disease, and treatment will be directed to the underlying cause. For example, dizziness or lightheadedness due to dehydration from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gastroenteritis</a> may require intravenous fluids and medications to stop the vomiting and diarrhea, while dizziness or lightheadedness from a heart rhythm condition may require admission to the hospital and specialized testing and treatment.</p>.<p><b>Vertigo treatment</b></p>
