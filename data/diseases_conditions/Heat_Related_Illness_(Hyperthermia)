Even short periods of high temperatures can cause serious health problems. Heat-related illness encompasses a spectrum of conditions that range from minor illnesses to life-threatening medical emergencies. There are several heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, heat syncope (fainting), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heat_rash_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">heat rash</a>.</p>.<p>Summer can bring heat waves with unusually high temperatures that can last for days and sometimes weeks.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_heat-related_illness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People suffer heat-related illness when the body's normal temperature control system is unable to effectively regulate its internal temperature. Normally, at high temperatures the body primarily cools itself through the evaporation of sweat. However, under certain conditions (air temperatures above 95 F/35 C high humidity), this cooling mechanism becomes less effective. When the humidity is high, sweat will not evaporate as quickly, preventing the body from releasing heat quickly. Furthermore, without adequate fluid intake, excessive fluid losses and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolyte</a> imbalances may also occur leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a>. In such cases, a person's body temperature rises rapidly. Very high body temperatures can damage the brain and other vital organs.</p>.<p>Other conditions that can limit the ability to regulate body temperature include old age, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obesity</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, poor circulation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sunburn_and_sun_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunburn</a>, and drug or alcohol use.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_of_heat-related_illness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Those at greatest risk of heat-related illness include:</p>.<p>Infants and children up to four years of age are very sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and rely on others to regulate their environment and to provide adequate fluid intake. Moreover, they have a higher metabolic rate and inefficient <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a> compared to adults.</p>.<p>People 65 years of age or older may not compensate for heat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> efficiently, and are less likely to sense and respond to changes in temperature. The elderly population also is at a higher risk because they usually have other pre-existing medical conditions, and they often take medications that can make them more vulnerable to dehydration (for example, diuretics).</p>.<p>Overweight individuals may be prone to heat-related illness because of their tendency to retain more body heat.</p>.<p>Any health condition that causes dehydration makes the body more susceptible to heat-related illness. If you or someone you know is at higher risk, it is important to drink plenty of fluids, avoid overexertion, and get your doctor or pharmacist's advice about medications being taken for:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_heat-related_illness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of heat-related illness vary based on the severity of the illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="heat_stroke" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat stroke is a medical emergency requiring immediate medical attention. It is the most severe form of heat-related illness, and it can sometimes lead to death or permanent disability. Heat stroke occurs when the body's ability to regulate its internal temperature has failed. The body's temperature rises rapidly in excess of 104 F (40. C), leading to damage to the brain and other vital organs. Generally, the extent of injury depends on the duration of exposure to excessive heat and the peak temperature attained. Heat stroke is sometimes referred to as sunstroke.</p>.<p>Heat stroke can be categorized as either <b>exertional heat stroke (EHS)</b> or <b>nonexertional heat stroke (NEHS)</b>. Exertional heat stroke generally occurs in young, healthy individuals who engage in strenuous activity in hot weather. Nonexertional heat stroke (also referred to as classic heat stroke) typically occurs in the elderly, the very young, or the chronically ill.</p>.<p>Warning signs of heat stroke vary but may include:</p>.<p>If you see any of these signs, you may be dealing with a life-threatening emergency. <b>Have someone call for immediate medical assistance while you begin cooling the affected individual: </b></p>.<p>If the affected individual's muscles begin to twitch uncontrollably (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizure</a>) as a result of heat stroke; keep the individual from injuring themselves, and do not place any object in the mouth and do not give fluids. If there is vomiting, make sure the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">airway</a> remains clear by turning the person on their side to prevent choking.</p>.<p><b><a name="heat_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat cramps usually affect people who sweat significantly during strenuous activity. This sweating depletes the body's salt and moisture. The low salt level in the muscles causes painful muscle cramps, often following <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a>. Heat cramps may also be a symptom of heat exhaustion.</p>.<p><b>What are the signs and symptoms of heat cramps? </b></p>.<p>Heat cramps are muscle pains or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle spasms</a> (usually in the abdomen, arms, or legs) that may occur in association with strenuous activity. If the affected person has heart problems or are on a low sodium <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a>, seek medical attention for heat cramps.</p>.<p><b><a name="heat_exhaustion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat exhaustion is the body's response to an excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">loss of water</a> and salt contained in sweat as a result of engaging in physical activity (work or exercising) in a hot environment. The body temperature may be normal or mildly elevated, but not above 104 F (40 C). It often occurs in individuals who are not accustomed to working or exercising in the heat. The symptoms may range from minor complaints to more pronounced symptoms, however the affected individual will not experience the central nervous system manifestations noted with heat stroke. Many cases of heat exhaustion can be treated outside of the hospital setting however it is important to understand that heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke if not properly addressed in a timely fashion.</p>.<p>Warning signs of heat exhaustion include:</p>.<p>The skin may be cool and moist. The affected individual's pulse rate may be fast, and breathing may be fast and shallow. If heat exhaustion is untreated and heat exposure continues, it may sometimes progress to heat stroke.</p>.<p>Cooling measures that may be effective include:</p>.<p><b>Seek medical attention immediately if: </b></p>.<p>Otherwise, help the person cool off, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or last longer than one hour.</p>.<p><b><a name="heat_syncope_fainting" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat syncope is a fainting episode that occurs in the heat, either during prolonged standing or exercise, or when rapidly standing from a lying or sitting position. It typically occurs in individuals who are not acclimatized to the heat. Dehydration can also contribute to this condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="heat_rash" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> is a skin irritation that occurs in hot, humid weather. It is caused by profuse sweating, which can lead to the blockage of sweat ducts. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children.</p>.<p>Heat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a> appears as a cluster of small red <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pimples</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a>. This skin irritation can be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itchy</a>. It typically occurs on the neck and upper chest, in the groin, under the breasts, and in the elbow creases.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p>The best treatment for heat rash is to avoid a hot, humid environment and to try to remain in cooler, less humid conditions. Try to keep the affected area dry, and wear light, loose clothing. Dusting powder may be used to increase comfort, but avoid using ointments or creams because they keep the skin warm and moist and may make the condition worse.</p>.<p>Treating heat rash is simple and usually does not require medical assistance.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="heat-related_illness_prevention" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To protect your health when temperatures are extremely high, remember to keep cool and use common sense. The following tips are important.</p>.<p>Increase your fluid intake regardless of your activity level. Do not wait until you feel thirsty. During heavy exercise in a hot environment, drink 2-4 glasses (16-32 ounces) of cool fluids each hour.</p>.<p><b>Caution:</b> If your doctor has prescribed a fluid-restricted <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a> or diuretics for you, ask your doctor how much you should drink.</p>.<p>Heavy sweating removes salt and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">minerals</a> from the body. These are necessary for your body and must be replaced. The easiest and safest way to replace salt and minerals is through your diet.</p>.<p>These self-help measures are not a substitute for medical care but may help you recognize and respond promptly to warning signs of trouble. Your best defense against heat-related illness is prevention. Staying cool and making simple changes in your fluid intake, activities, and clothing during hot weather can help you remain safe and healthy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
