options during labor and delivery are a personal choice, and a birth plan can 
typically be individualized according to a woman's wishes, but the circumstances 
of labor and individual medical conditions can sometimes determine what pain 
relief options are indicated. Available medical pain control options range from 
pain control medications to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nerve_blocks/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nerve blocks</a> and anesthesia. It is helpful to 
discuss your preferences with your health care professional in advance so that 
your questions can be fully answered and your wishes can be expressed. Of 
course, during your labor, your health care professional will assess your 
progress and determine how you are feeling. It's fine to change your mind about 
pain relief options even during labor. Consequently, understanding the various 
options for pain control will help you make an informed decision.</p>.<p>This article describes the most commonly used medical pain relief 
interventions used for labor and delivery. All of these options have been shown 
to be safe for both mother and baby.</p>.<p><b><a name="regional_anesthesia_spinal_and_epidural_blocks" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Spinal and epidural anesthesia are popular choices for pain control because 
they do not affect your ability to push during labor. In both of these 
procedures, medications are injected near the nerves of the low back to block 
pain signals from your lower body, even though you remain awake and labor is 
usually not significantly slowed. An anesthesiologist typically administers this 
type of anesthesia. A spinal block involves injection of the medication right 
around the spinal nerves, while in an epidural block the medicine is injected 
into the sac that surrounds the spinal cord. Before the medications are 
injected, a numbing medication is given in the low back. Both these options can 
also be used for a Cesarean delivery. </p>.<p>Because many women are not able to urinate and others are affected by 
anesthesia, you may require a urinary catheter with spinal or epidural 
anesthesia. An uncommon complication is experiencing a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> after the 
anesthesia wears off. Both types of anesthesia may reduce your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> 
somewhat, although this is more common with a spinal block. </p>.<p>A spinal block 
requires less medication and is typically given one time, while a catheter may 
be inserted into the epidural space for repeated delivery of anesthetic 
medications. </p>.<p>An epidural block takes about 10 to 20 minutes to work, and because a 
catheter is inserted into the epidural space, the effects can last as long as 
needed due to the ability to inject more medication. A spinal block begins 
working immediately, but its effects last only about 2 Â½ hours. It is possible 
to have a combination of spinal and epidural anesthesia.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="local_anesthesia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Local injections of a numbing medication may be used to relieve a small area 
of pain, typically around the vagina, if you require an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/episiotomy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">episiotomy</a> to extend the 
vaginal opening or if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stitches</a> are needed to repair any damage. This type of 
anesthesia cannot be used to relieve the pain from contractions during labor.</p>.<p><b><a name="pudendal_block" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A pudendal block is another type of local anesthesia. It involves injecting a 
numbing medication into the vaginal wall shortly before delivery to block pain 
signals from the vagina and area around the vaginal opening. It usually works 
within 10 minutes and lasts for up to an hour.</p>.<p><b><a name="narcotics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Narcotics, or opioids, are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> that decrease our perception of pain. They 
may be given intravenously or as an intramuscular injection during labor. They 
may lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> or sleepiness, and they do not completely eliminate pain. 
Although narcotics have been shown to be safe in labor, they may cause a 
temporary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a> for both mother and baby.</p>.<p><b><a name="nitrous_oxide" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nitrous oxide is an odorless, tasteless, inhaled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gas</a> that is given using a 
hand-held face mask. It is not generally used in labor in the US but is 
sometimes used in the United Kingdom and Canada. It has little effect on the 
baby. Nitrous oxide does not eliminate pain but changes the way the pain is 
perceived.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
