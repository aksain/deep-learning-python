It is one type of birth defect. People with the disease do not have the nerve cells in the intestine required to expel stools from the body normally.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_many_newborns_have_hirschsprung_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hirschsprung disease occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns. Children with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/down_syndrome_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Down syndrome</a> and other medical problems, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congenital_heart_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">congenital heart defects</a>, are at much greater risk. For example, about one in 100 children with Down syndrome also has Hirschsprung disease.</p>.<p>Hirschsprung disease is congenital, or present at birth; however, symptoms may or may not be obvious at birth. If you have a child with Hirschsprung disease, your chances of having more children with Hirschsprung disease are greater than people who don’t have a child with Hirschsprung disease. Also, if a parent has Hirschsprung disease, the chance of their child having Hirschsprung disease is higher. Talk with your doctor to learn more.</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_hirschsprung_disease_in_newborns" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An early symptom in some newborns is failure to have a first bowel movement within 48 hours after birth. Other symptoms may include</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_in_toddlers_and_older_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of Hirschsprung disease in toddlers and older children may include</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_hirschsprung_disease_is_it_inherited" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before birth, a child's nerve cells normally grow along the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> in the direction of the anus. With Hirschsprung disease, the nerve cells stop growing too soon. Why the nerve cells stop growing is unclear. Some Hirschsprung disease is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>, meaning it is passed from parent to child through genes. Hirschsprung disease is not caused by anything a mother did while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a>.</p>.<p>Isolated Hirschsprung disease can result from mutations in one of several genes, including the RET (most common), EDNRB, and EDN3 genes. However, the genetics of this condition are complex and are not yet completely understood. While a mutation in a single gene sometimes causes the condition, mutations in multiple genes may be required in some cases. The genetic cause of the condition is unknown in approximately half of affected individuals.</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hirschsprung_disease_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging, and the diagnosis for Hirschsprung disease is based on</p>.<p><strong>If your doctor suspects Hirschsprung disease, he or she may refer your child to a pediatric gastroenterologist—a doctor who specializes in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tummy_trouble_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">digestive diseases</a> in children—for additional evaluation.</strong></p>.<p><b><a name="surgery_for_hirschsprung_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><strong>Hirschsprung disease is a life-threatening illness, and treatment requires surgery. </strong>Children who have surgery for Hirschsprung disease most often feel better after surgery. If growth was slow because of Hirschsprung disease, growth typically improves after surgery.</p>.<p>For treatment, a pediatric surgeon will perform a pull-through procedure or an ostomy surgery. During either procedure, the surgeon may remove all or part of the colon, called a colectomy.</p>.<p>During a<strong> pull-through procedure</strong>, a surgeon removes the part of the large intestine that is missing nerve cells and connects the healthy part to the anus. A surgeon most often does a pull-through procedure soon after diagnosis.</p>.<p><strong>Ostomy surgery</strong> is a surgical procedure that reroutes the normal movement of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a> out of the body when a part of the bowel is removed. Creating an ostomy means bringing part of the intestine through the abdominal wall so that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a> can leave the body without passing through the anus. The opening in the abdomen through which stool leaves the body is called a stoma. A removable external collection pouch, called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance, is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect the stool. The child or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caregiving/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">caregiver</a> will need to empty the pouch several times each day.</p>.<p>Although most children with Hirschsprung disease do not need ostomy surgery, a child sick from Hirschsprung disease may need ostomy surgery to get better before undergoing the pull-through procedure. This gives the inflamed areas of the intestine time to heal. In most cases, an ostomy is temporary and the child will have a second surgery to close the ostomy and reattach the intestine. However, sometimes children with Hirschsprung disease have a permanent ostomy, especially if a long segment of the bowel is missing nerve cells or the child has repeated episodes of bowel inflammation, which health care providers call enterocolitis.</p>.<p><strong>Ostomy surgeries include the following:</strong></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_i_expect_as_my_newborn_or_child_recovers_from_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After surgery, your child will need time to adjust to the new structure of his or her large intestine.</p>.<p>Typically, these problems improve over time with guidance from your child’s doctors. Most children eventually have normal bowel movements.</p>.<p>Infants will feel better after ostomy surgery because they will be able to pass <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gas</a> and stool easily.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
