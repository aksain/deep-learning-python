<p><b><a name="hair_loss_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because there are many types of hair loss, finding the cause can be challenging. This review will cover the most common causes of hair loss occurring on normal unscarred scalp skin. The medical term for hair loss is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">alopecia</a>.</p>.<p>Most hair loss is not associated with systemic or internal disease, nor is poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> a frequent factor. Hair may simply thin as a result of predetermined genetic factors and the overall <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> process. Many men and women may notice mild physiologic thinning of hair starting in their 30s and 40s. Life vicissitudes, including illness, emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>, protein deprivation (during strict <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">dieting</a>), and hormonal changes like those in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menopause</a> may cause hair loss.</p>.<p>Several health conditions, including thyroid disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">iron deficiency anemia</a>, can cause hair loss. While <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_blood_tests/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">thyroid blood tests</a> and other lab tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), on people who have ordinary hair loss are usually normal, it is important to exclude treatable causes of hair loss.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_doctors_treat_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Such basic health screening can be done by a family physician, internist, or gynecologist. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in problems of skin, hair, and nails and may provide more advanced diagnosis and treatment of hair thinning and loss. Sometimes a scalp biopsy may be necessary.</p>.<p>Although many medications list "hair loss" among their potential side effects, most <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> are not likely to induce hair loss. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> chemotherapy and immunosuppressive medications commonly produce hair loss. Complete hair loss after chemotherapy usually regrows after six to 12 months.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_classify_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are numerous ways to categorize hair loss. One must first examine the scalp to determine if the hair loss is due to the physical destruction and loss of hair follicles (scarring alopecia). If the scalp appears perfectly normal with plenty of empty hair follicles, this is called non-scarring hair loss. On the other hand, the follicles are permanently destroyed in scarring hair loss. Non-scarring hair loss can also be seen in situations where there is physical or chemical damage to the hair shaft resulting in breakage. Occasionally, it may be necessary to do a biopsy of the scalp to distinguish these conditions. Sometimes, a physician may pull a hair to examine the appearance of the hair shaft as well as the percentage of growing hairs (anagen phase). This article will concentrate on the non-scarring types of hair loss.</p>.<p>Some conditions produce small areas of hair loss, while others affect large areas of the scalp. Common causes of patchy hair loss are</p>.<p>Some common causes of diffuse hair loss are</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_alopecia_areata" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A common condition, alopecia areata usually starts as a single quarter-sized circle of perfectly smooth bald skin. These patches usually regrow in three to six months without treatment. Sometimes, white hair temporarily regrows and then becomes dark. The most extensive form is called alopecia totalis, in which the entire scalp goes bald. It's important to emphasize that patients who have localized hair loss generally don't go on to lose hair all over the scalp. Alopecia areata can affect hair on other parts of the body, too (for example, the beard or eyebrows).</p>.<p>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own hair follicles. Most patients, however, do not have systemic problems and need no medical tests. While alopecia areata is frequently blamed on "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>," in fact, it may be the other way around; that is, having alopecia may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a>.</p>.<p>Treatments for alopecia areata include injecting small amounts of steroids like triamcinolone into affected patches to stimulate hair growth. Although localized injections may not be practical for large areas, often this is a very effective treatment in helping the hairs return sooner. Other treatments, such as oral steroids, other immunosuppressives, or ultraviolet light therapy, are available for more widespread or severe cases but may be impractical for most patients because of potential side effects or risks. In most mild cases, patients can easily cover up or comb over the affected areas. In more severe and chronic cases, some patients wear hairpieces; nowadays, some men shave their whole scalp now that this look has become fashionable. Recently, some beneficial results have been noted in small groups of patients with extensive alopecia areata or alopecia totalis with a JAK1/2 inhibitor, baricitinib (Olumiant). Long-term studies are under way.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_traction_alopecia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This is a small or localized hair loss area caused by repetitive or persistent pulling or traction on hair roots. Tight braids and ponytails can pull hard enough on hairs to make them fall out. If this happens, it's best to choose hairstyles that put less tension on hair. The sooner this is done the better to avoid permanent damage.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_trichotillomania" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This refers to the habitual pulling or twisting of one's own hair. The scalp and eyelashes are often affected. Unlike alopecia areata patches, which are perfectly smooth, hair patches in trichotillomania show broken-off hairs. Treatment is often entirely behavioral. One has to notice the behavior and then consciously stop. Severe or resistant cases may require stress counseling with a therapist or psychologist or medical treatment with a psychiatrist. Several <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antidepressant</a> or anti-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> medications have been shown to help with this condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_tinea_capitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Tinea</i> is the medical word for fungal infection, and <i>capitis</i> means head. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/tinea_capitis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Tinea capitis</a> is fungal infection of the scalp that for the most part affects school-age children. Tinea capitis is more common in black African or African-American scalps. This condition is rare in healthy adults. Bald spots usually show broken-off hairs and is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dermatitis</a>. Oral antifungals can penetrate the hair roots and cure the infection, after which hair grows back. Sharing hats or combs and brushes may transmit tinea capitis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_generalized_diffuse_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This is an overall hair thinning without specific bald spots or patterns. While this type of hair loss may not be noticeable to others, often the individual will feel their hair is not as thick or full as it previously was. Common conditions in this category are</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_telogen_effluvium" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Under normal conditions, scalp hairs live for about three years (the anagen, or growing, phase); they then enter the telogen, or resting, phase. During the three-month telogen period, the hair root shrivels up into a small "club," then the hair falls out. It is therefore normal to lose about 100 hairs every day, more of them on days when shampooing loosens the hairs that are ready to fall out. The hairs are then replaced by the body.</p>.<p>Sometimes people who worry about losing their hair start noticing hairs on their pillow or in the sink, not realizing that they've always been there. A close look at these will usually reveal the club at the end, showing that these hairs were shed normally. Normally, about 10% of scalp hairs are in the telogen phase.</p>.<p>There are several circumstances that produce a "shock to the system" that alters the hair growth rhythm. As a result, as much as 30%-40% of the hairs can cycle into telogen. Three months later, hairs come out in a massive shedding (effluvium), especially near the front of the scalp. These include</p>.<p>None of these need be life-threatening, nor does hair loss usually follow them. (Moreover, it can happen after one pregnancy, but not the next.) But when the hair falls out, it's all over the place -- covering the pillow, clogging the drain, and so forth. Paradoxically, the more dramatic the hair loss, the better the prognosis, because when the body gets back into normal rhythm, most if not all of that hair comes back; these people need no special treatment. Normal shampooing can continue, because this only loosens hairs that were going to come out anyway.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_androgenetic_or_androgenic_alopecia_male-pattern_baldness_female-pattern_baldness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This type of alopecia is often attributed to genetic predisposition and family history. Androgenic alopecia is seen in both men and women. The hair loss in men is often faster, earlier onset, and more extensive.</p>.<p>Doctors refer to common baldness as "androgenetic alopecia" or "androgenic alopecia," which implies that a combination of hormones and heredity (genetics) is needed to develop the condition. The exact cause of this pattern is unknown. (The male hormones involved are present in both men and women.)</p>.<p>Even men who never "go bald" thin out somewhat over the years. Unlike those with reversible telogen shedding, those with common male-pattern hair loss don't notice much hair coming out; they just see that it's not there anymore. Adolescent boys notice some receding near the temples as their hairlines change from the straight-across boys' pattern to the more "M-shaped" pattern of adult men. This normal development does not mean they are losing hair.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatment_is_there_for_hair_loss_in_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are few scientifically proven and FDA-approved treatments for hair loss. There are thousands of unproven claims and products to help with hair regrowth. Many conditioners, shampoos, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a>, and other products claim to help hair grow in some unspecified way. Nioxin has been a popular brand of shampoo for hair loss, but there is no compelling evidence showing it is any more effective than regular shampoos. These products are usually harmless but generally not scientifically proven and therefore potentially useless. To slow down hair loss, there are at least four potentially effective, basic options. These include medications like Minoxidil, and Propecia, which are for long-term use. Stopping these drugs does not seem to worsen or exacerbate the prior hair loss. The patient will simply revert to the state he would have been in had he never started treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_options_do_people_have_for_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many options and alternative cosmetic treatments for hair loss. Some of these are listed here and include hair-fiber powders, hairpieces, synthetic wigs, human hair wigs, hair extensions, hair weaves, laser, and surgery.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_hair_loss_in_women_different_than_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women lose hair on an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> (genetic) basis, too, but the female pattern tends to be more diffuse, with less likelihood of the crown and frontal hairline being lost. Although some women may notice hair thinning as early as their 20s, the pace of hair loss tends to be gradual, often taking years to become obvious to others. There seems to be a normal physiologic thinning that comes with age and occurs in many women in their early to mid-30s. More women have underlying causes of hair loss than men. These include treatable conditions like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anemia</a> and thyroid disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/polycystic_ovary_syndrome_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">polycystic ovary syndrome</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polycystic_ovary/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">PCOS</a>). These conditions are diagnosed by blood tests along with a historical and physical evidence. Although a few studies have suggested that baldness may be inherited through the mother's family genes, these theories require further testing. Current studies are inconclusive. Although not indicated for female pattern balding, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spironolactone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">spironolactone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spironolactone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aldactone</a>) has had some success in treating this condition.</p>.<p>While stories about hats choking off follicles or long hair pulling on the roots may be more folklore, repeat hair trauma like tightly woven hair pulled back and consistent friction can potentially worsen or cause localized hair loss in some individuals. Individuals who pull their hair tightly back in a rubber band can develop a localized hair loss at the front of the scalp.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_pregnancy_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnancy may cause many changes in the scalp hair. As the hormones fluctuate during pregnancy, a large number of women feel their hair thickens and becomes fuller. This may be related to change in the number of hairs cycling in the growth phase of hair growth, but the exact reason is unknown. Quite often, there may be a loss of hair (telogen effluvium) after delivery or a few months later which will eventually normalize.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_specific_treatments_are_there_for_hair_loss_in_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Female hair loss treatments include minoxidil (Rogaine), hair transplants, hair-powder fibers like Toppik, wigs, hair extensions, and weaves.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_vitamins_are_good_for_hair_loss_are_there_home_remedies_for_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A good daily multivitamin containing zinc, vitamin B, folate, iron, and calcium is a reasonable choice, although there is no good evidence that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">vitamins</a> have any meaningful benefit in alopecia. Newer studies suggest that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin D</a> may be somewhat helpful and worth considering. Specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies like iron or vitamin B12 may be diagnosed by blood tests and treated.</p>.<p>Multiple vitamins, including biotin, have been promoted for hair growth, but solid scientific studies for many of these claims are lacking. While taking biotin and other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">supplements</a> marketed for hair, skin, and nails probably won't worsen anything, it may also not necessarily help the situation. Therefore, advertised hair-regrowth <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">supplements</a> should be approached with mild caution. There is only anecdotal evidence that oral or topical application <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/garlic_allium_sativum_l-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">garlic</a>, onion juice, saw palmetto, coconut oil, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/evening_primrose_oil-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">evening primrose oil</a>, apple cider vinegar, creatine, and pumpkin seed oil are of benefit for hair loss.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_itchy_scalp_cause_hair_loss" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Itchy</a> scalp may be a symptom of a scalp disease that could produce hair loss.
