the sources, chemicals, and possible contaminants used to manufacture many club 
drugs make it extremely difficult to determine toxicity and associated medical 
consequences. Nonetheless, we do know that: </p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatment_options_exist" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is very little information available in the scientific literature 
about treatment for persons who abuse or are dependent upon club drugs. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_widespread_is_club_drug_abuse" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey*</b> </p>.<p>MTF has reported consistently low levels of abuse of these club drugs since 
they were added to the survey. For GHB and ketamine, this occurred in 2000; for 
Rohypnol, 1996. According to results of the 2009 MTF survey, 0.7 percent of 
8th-grade and 1.1 percent of 12th-grade students reported past-year** use of 
GHB, a statistically significant decrease from peak-year use of 1.2 percent in 
2000 for 8th-graders and 2.0 percent for 12th-graders in 2004. GHB use among 
10th-grade students was reported at 1.0 percent, an increase from 2008 (0.5 
percent), and statistically unchanged from peak use of 1.4 percent in 2002 and 
2003. </p>.<p>Past-year use of ketamine was reported by 1.0 percent of 8th-graders, 1.3 
percent of 10th-graders, and 1.7 percent of 12th-graders in 2009. These 
percentages also represent significant decreases from peak years: 2000 for 
8th-graders (at 1.6 percent) and 2002 for 10th- and 12th-graders (at 2.2 and 2.6 
percent, respectively). </p>.<p>For Rohypnol, 0.4 percent of 8th- and 10th-graders, and 1.0 percent of 
12th-graders reported past-year use, also down from peak use in 1996 for 
8th-graders (1.0 percent), 1997 for 10th-graders (1.3 percent), and 2002 and 
2004 for 12th-graders (1.6 percent). <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="other_information_sources" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For more information about club drugs, visit www.clubdrugs.gov,
