Any kind of irritant, whether environmental, infectious, or manmade, can cause symptoms consistent with eye allergies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_basic_anatomy_of_the_outer_eye" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eye allergies mainly involve the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctiva</a>, which is the tissue lining (mucus membrane) that covers the white surface of the eyeball and the inner folds of the eyelids. The conjunctiva is a barrier structure that is exposed to the environment and the many different allergens (substances that stimulate an allergic response) that become airborne. It is rich in blood vessels and contains more mast cells (cells that release histamine, a chemical mediator of allergic reactions) than the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>.</p>.<p>The lacrimal (tear) glands are located in the upper and outer portions of the eye. They are responsible for producing the watery part of tears, which keeps the eye moist and washes away irritants. The tears also contain important parts of the immune defense such as immunoglobulins (antibodies), lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells), and enzymes.</p>.<p>The cornea is the transparent sheath in front of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lens</a> of the eye. The cornea has no blood vessels and very little immune activity.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_are_the_eyes_an_easy_target_for_allergies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When you open your eyes, the conjunctiva becomes directly exposed to the environment without the help of a filtering system such as the cilia, the hairs commonly found in the nose.</p>.<p>Approximately 54 million people, about 20% of the U.S. population, have symptoms of allergies. Almost half of these people have allergic eye disease.</p>.<p>People who are more susceptible to allergic eye disease are those with a health history of allergic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_rhinitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rhinitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atopic_dermatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atopic dermatitis</a> and those with a strong family and/or personal history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergy</a>. Symptoms and signs usually appear before the age of 30.</p>.<p>The scenario for developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">allergy symptoms</a> and signs is much the same for the eyes as that for the nose. Allergens cause the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergy</a> antibody IgE to coat numerous mast cells in the conjunctiva. Upon reexposure to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergen</a>, the mast cell is prompted to release histamine and other mediators. The result is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>, burning, and runny eyes that become red and irritated due to inflammation, which results in congestion and discomfort. The eyelids may swell, even to the point of closing altogether. Sometimes, the conjunctiva swells with fluid and protrudes from the surface of the eye, resembling a "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hives/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hive</a>" on the eye. These reactions may also induce light sensitivity. Typically, both eyes are affected by an allergic reaction. Occasionally, only one eye is involved, particularly when only one eye is rubbed with an allergen, as this causes mast cells to release more histamine.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_eye_allergy_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Typical symptoms associated with eye allergies include inflammation of the conjunctiva that is caused by a reaction to allergens. The inflammation causes enlargement of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva ("congestion"), resulting in a red or bloodshot appearance of the eyes. These allergy symptoms can range from very mild redness to severe swelling associated with discharge.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_allergic_eye_conditions" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Allergic conjunctivitis</a>, also called "allergic rhinoconjunctivitis," is the most common allergic eye disorder. The condition is usually seasonal and is associated with hay <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a>. The main cause is pollens, although <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/indoor_allergens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indoor allergens</a> such as dust mites, molds, and dander from household pets such as cats and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puppies_and_dogs_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">dogs</a> may affect the eyes year-round. Typical complaints include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a>, redness, tearing, burning, watery discharge, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> swelling. To a large degree, the acute (initial) symptoms appear related to histamine release.</p>.<p>The treatments of choice are topical antihistamine drops such as olopatadine (Patanol), decongestants, and the newer mast-cell stabilizer medications. Topical steroids should be used only if prescribed by a doctor for severe reactions and on a short-term basis because of the potential for side effects. In general, oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">antihistamines</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loratadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">loratadine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loratadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Claritin</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cetirizine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">cetirizine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cetirizine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zyrtec</a>) are the least effective option, but they are often used for treating allergic rhinitis together with allergic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">conjunctivitis</a>.</p>.<p>Rubbing itchy eyes is a natural response. However, rubbing usually worsens the allergic reaction due to the physical impact on the mast cells, which causes them to release more mediators of the immune response. Translation: Do not rub your eyes!</p>.<p>Commonly called "atopic keratoconjunctivitis," this health condition is a notorious cause of severe eye changes, particularly in young adults. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis implies inflammation of both the conjunctiva and cornea. "Kerato" means pertaining to the cornea. This form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctivitis</a> usually affects males 3 times more frequently than females and may begin in late adolescence. It's peak incidence is in males aged 30 to 50. It is more common in those who had <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_atopic_dermatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atopic dermatitis</a> in early childhood. The condition is characterized by intensely itchy, red areas that appear on the eyelids. A heavy discharge from the eyes can occur, and the skin of the eyelid may show scales and crusts. In severe cases, the eyes become sensitive to light, and the eyelids noticeably thicken. If managed poorly, there can be permanent scarring of the cornea due to chronic rubbing and scratching of the eyes. This scarring can cause visual changes.</p>.<p>The triggers for atopic keratoconjunctivitis appear to be similar to those of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">atopic dermatitis</a>. A search for common food allergies, such as eggs, peanuts, milk, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/soy_glycine_soya-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">soy</a>, wheat, or fish is important. Airborne allergens, particularly dust mites and pet dander, have been overlooked as a significant contributing factor and should be evaluated and controlled.</p>.<p>The hallmark of treatment for allergic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">conjunctivitis</a> is the use of potent antihistamines (similar to those used in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/atopic_dermatitis_or_eczema_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">atopic dermatitis</a>) to subdue the itching. Topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, and the short-term use of oral steroids are all beneficial for relief of the itching. Occasionally, an infection of the area (usually with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">staphylococcus</a>, commonly referred to as "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">staph</a>") worsens the symptoms, and antibiotic treatment may help control the itching. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy_shots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Allergy shots</a> are useful in selected cases.</p>.<p>Atopic keratoconjunctivitis can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cataract</a> formation in up to 10% of cases. In rare cases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a> can occur.</p>.<p>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is an uncommon health condition that tends to occur in preadolescent boys (3:1 male to female ratio) and is usually outgrown during the late <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a> or early adulthood. (Vernal is another term for "spring.") Vernal keratoconjunctivitis usually appears in the late spring and particularly occurs in rural areas where dry, dusty, windy, and warm conditions prevail. The eyes become intensely itchy, sensitive to light, and the lids feel uncomfortable and droopy. The eyes produce a "stringy" discharge and, when examined, the surface under the upper eyelids appears "cobblestoned." A closer examination of the eye reveals severe inflammation due to the vast number of mast cells and accumulated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in the allergic response), producing so-called called "Trantas dots."</p>.<p>Improper treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis can lead to permanent visual impairment. The most effective treatment appears to be a short-term course of low-dose topical steroids. Topical mast-cell stabilizers and topical antihistamines can also be beneficial. Wraparound <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eyeglasses_sunglasses_and_magnifiers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunglasses</a> are helpful to protect the eyes against wind and dust.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/keratitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Keratitis</a>, or the inflammation of the cornea, in vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis is largely caused by a substance that is released from the eosinophils called major basic protein.</p>.<p>This health condition is named for its typical feature, large papillae, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a>, on the conjunctiva under the upper eyelid. These bumps are likely the result of irritation from a foreign substance, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contact lenses</a>. Hard, soft, and rigid gas-permeable lenses are all associated with the condition. The reaction is possibly linked to the protein buildup on the contact lens surface. This condition is believed, in part, to be due to an allergic reaction to either the contact lens itself, protein deposits on the contact lens, or the preservative in the solution for the contact lenses. Redness and itching of the eye develop, along with a thick discharge.</p>.<p>Allergy to contact lenses is most common among wearers of hard contact lenses and is least common among those who use disposable lenses, especially the one-day or one-week types. Sleeping with the contact lenses on greatly increases the risk of developing GPC.</p>.<p>The most effective treatment is to stop wearing the contact lenses. Occasionally, changing the type of lens in addition to more frequent cleaning or using disposable daily wear lenses will prevent the condition from recurring.</p>.<p>The giant papillae on the conjunctiva, which are characteristic of GPC, however, may persist for months despite these measures. Eye medications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cromolyn/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">cromolyn</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cromolyn/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Opticrom</a>) or lodoxamide (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lodoxamide-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Alomide</a>), often are used in this condition, sometimes for several months. Contact lenses should not be worn while these medications are being used.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_eyelid_allergies_also_called_contact_eye_allergies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Contact eye allergies are essentially <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_dermatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contact dermatitis</a> of the eyelids. This is allergic inflammation of the eyelid from direct contact with certain allergens. Women in particular may experience this problem due to allergic reactions to preservatives in eye products and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beauty_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">makeup</a> (for example, eye creams, eyeliner or eye pencils, mascara, and nail <nobr>polish -- from</nobr> rubbing the eye with the fingers). Other irritants include common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter (OTC)</a> ointments such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neomycin-oral_solution_tablet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">neomycin</a>/bacitracin/polymyxin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neomycinbacitracinpolymyxin-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Neosporin</a> or Bacitracin) as well as contact lens solutions (especially if they contain thimerosal). Symptoms and signs that are similar to those of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/poison_ivy_oak_and_sumac/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">poison ivy</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> appear 24 to 48 hours after exposure to the offending agent. The eyelids may develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a>, itching, and redness. The conjunctiva may also become red and watery. If the eyelids continually come into contact with the offending allergens, the lids may become chronically (long term) inflamed and thickened.</p>.<p>The best treatment for eyelid allergies is avoidance of the sensitizing agent(s). Changing to hypoallergenic lens solutions, cosmetics, or topical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_care/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eye care</a> products is usually necessary. Application of a mild topical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroid</a> cream for short periods will probably help. As is the case with atopic dermatitis, it is important to treat any secondary bacterial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impetigo/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin infection</a> that may develop.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_conditions_can_be_confused_with_eye_allergies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following is a list of health conditions, the symptoms of which are commonly confused with eye allergy.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_eye_allergies_are_there_home_remedies_for_eye_allergies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people with eye allergies treat themselves and do so quite effectively with OTC eye care products. Most commonly, home care consists of an allergy sufferer flushing the eye with water. With exposure to an allergen to the eye, it is important to thoroughly flush the eye with lukewarm tap water or commercially prepared eyewash solution. If these remedies are not working or if there is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">eye pain</a>, extreme redness, or heavy discharge, you should seek medical advice. Some conditions, for example, are serious with potential sight-threatening health complications if required treatment is delayed.</p>.<p>Moistening the eyes with artificial tears helps to dilute accumulated allergens and also prevents the allergens from sticking to the conjunctiva. Tear substitutes may also improve the defense function of the natural tear film.</p>.<p>Antihistamine eye drops work by blocking histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The histamine, therefore, is unable to attach to the conjunctiva and exert its effects. They are effective in relieving itching but have little impact on swelling or redness. They have two advantages over antihistamine tablets; there is a quicker onset of action and less drying of the eye. The new generation of topical antihistamines includes emedastine difumarate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/emedastine-ophthalmic_solution/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Emadine</a>) and levocabastine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levocabastine-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Livostin</a>). The side effects of these medications include mild stinging and burning of the eyes upon use, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headaches</a>, and sleepiness. But treatment with antihistamines at the point of irritation is still preferable than treating systemically with oral antihistamines if possible.</p>.<p>Decongestants take the redness away as advertised. However, they do not help relieve itching. They act by shrinking the blood vessels on the conjunctiva. (They are not really effective against allergic eyes.) The decongestants oxymetazdine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetrahydrozoline-ophth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Visine</a> LR) and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride (Visine Original) are available OTC. They do have a potential for abuse and should not be used by people with narrow-angle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a>, an eye disease characterized by elevated pressure within the eye.</p>.<p>The prolonged use of decongestant nasal sprays can produce a rebound phenomenon in which the medication begins to cause more congestion than it relieves. This phenomenon rarely occurs in the eyes with the repeated use of decongestant drops. The mucous membranes of the eye are different from those of the nose. The eyes can become irritated and less responsive to the drops, but unlike the nose, the eyes tend not to develop "rebound" redness.</p>.<p>Combination antihistamine-decongestant preparations can provide quick relief that lasts a few hours. They lessen the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itch</a>, redness, and swelling and are very useful for milder symptoms. Common combinations include pheniramine with naphcyoline hydrochloride (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naphazoline_with_pheniramine-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Naphcon-A</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naphazoline_with_pheniramine-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Opcon-A</a>) and antazoline with naphazoline (<span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_78"><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naphazoline-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Vasocon</a>-A). Side effects are minimal, but the drops may become less effective if used for prolonged periods. They do have a potential for abuse and should not be used by people with narrow-angle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/glaucoma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">glaucoma</a>.</span></p>.<p>Mast-cell stabilizers prevent the release of chemical mediators of inflammation from the mast cells. These are effective for all eye allergies. The first of this class of drug was cromolyn sodium (Crolom or Opticrom), which is available OTC. This topical medicine has been effective for treating mild cases of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and probably mild allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and has no significant side effects. It does have a slow onset of action. The newer agent, lodoxamide (Alomide), is 2,500 times more potent than Crolom and has a faster onset of action. This prescription medicine may be used in children older than 2 years of age and has minimal side effects. One disadvantage is the need to use the drops four times a day, and long-term use is necessary to prevent symptoms.</p>.<p>The most effective mast-cell stabilizer, which also has antihistamine properties, is olopatadine (Patanol). Available by prescription, it is 250 times more effective than Alomide in relieving itching and redness. This drug provides rapid relief of itching and burning eyes. It can also prevent symptoms when used before an exposure or before the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pollen</a> season. The drops are very comfortable in the eye and can be used in children as young as 3 years old. The longer duration of action allows dosing of twice a day.</p>.<p>Another new product, ketotifen (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketotifen-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zaditor</a>), also has dual mast-cell-stabilizing and antihistamine effects. It dramatically reduces itching and redness and gives more rapid relief within minutes.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDS</a>) are particularly useful in treating itchy eyes. They reduce redness and swelling to a lesser degree. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketorolac-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Ketorolac</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketorolac_tromethamine-ophthalmic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Acular</a>) is a topical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAID</a>, which may cause temporary stinging and burning in 40% of users.</p>.<p>Steroid antiinflammatory eyedrops are very effective in treating eye allergies, but they are reserved for severe symptoms that are unresponsive to other treatments. They must be used with caution in people with bleeding tendencies because they can increase the bleeding risk. Since there are significant risks with long-term treatment, their use should be supervised by an ophthalmologist.</p>.<p>Caution must be taken, however, because of the potential side effects of the long-term use of steroids, even in eye drop form. Side effects of steroids include elevated pressure in the eyes and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cataracts</a>. The elevated pressure in the eyes can become glaucoma and lead to damage of the optic (eye) nerve and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loss of vision</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Cataracts</a> are a clouding or opacification of the clear natural lens within the eye, which can interfere with vision.
