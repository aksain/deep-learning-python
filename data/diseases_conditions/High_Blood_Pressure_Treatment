Ideally, hypertension is treated early before it damages critical organs in the body. Increased public awareness and screening programs to detect early, uncomplicated hypertension are keys to successful treatment. Successful early treatment of high blood pressure can significantly decrease the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a>.</p>.<p>The goal for patients with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is to attain a blood pressure of 134/80 mm Hg. Although lifestyle changes in prehypertensive patients are appropriate, it is not well established that treatment with medication of patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">prehypertension</a> is beneficial.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="starting_treatment_for_high_blood_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Blood pressure persistently higher than 134/80 mm Hg usually is treated with lifestyle modifications and medication.

(See the next section for a more detailed discussion of each of the several classes of antihypertensive medications.)</p>.<p>In some situations, certain classes of antihypertensive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> are preferable to others as the first-line (preferred first-choice) drugs. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocking (ARB) drugs are the drugs of choice in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a>, chronic kidney failure (in diabetics or nondiabetics), or heart attack (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myocardial infarction</a>) that weakens the heart muscle (systolic dysfunction). Also, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta blockers</a> are sometimes the preferred treatment in hypertensive patients with a resting tachycardia (racing heart beat when resting) or an acute (rapid onset) heart attack.</p>.<p>Patients with hypertension may sometimes have a co-existing second medical condition. In such cases, a particular class of antihypertensive medication or combination of drugs may be chosen as the first-line approach. The idea in these cases is to control the hypertension while also benefiting the second condition. For example, beta blockers may treat chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">migraine headache</a> as well as hypertension. Also, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB drug can be used to treat certain diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies) and certain kidney diseases where reduction in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/proteinuria_protein_in_the_urine/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">protein in the urine</a> would be beneficial.</p>.<p>In other situations, certain classes of antihypertensive medications should not be used. Dihydropyridine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcium_channel_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">calcium channel blockers</a> used alone may cause problems for patients with chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/renal_artery_stenosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">renal disease</a> by increasing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/proteinuria_protein_in_the_urine/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">proteinuria</a>. However, an ACE inhibitor will blunt this effect. The non-dihydropyridine type of calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with heart failure. However, these drugs may be beneficial in treating certain arrhythmias. Some drugs, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/minoxidil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">minoxidil</a>, may be relegated to second- or third-line choices for treatment. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Clonidine</a> is an excellent drug but has side effects such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, sleepiness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a> making it a second- or third-line choice. See the section below on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> for the antihypertensive drugs that are used in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnant</a> women.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_with_combinations_of_drugs_for_high_blood_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The use of combination drug therapy for hypertension is common. At times, using smaller amounts of one or more drugs in combination can minimize side effects while maximizing the anti-hypertensive effect. For example, diuretics, which also can be used alone, are more often used in a low dose in combination with another class of antihypertensive medications. This way, the diuretic has fewer side effects while improving the blood pressure-lowering effect of the other drug. Diuretics also are added to other antihypertensive medications when a patient with hypertension has fluid retention and swelling (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a>).</p>.<p>A useful combination is that of a beta blocker with an alpha blocker in patients with high blood pressure and enlargement of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">prostate gland</a> in order to treat both conditions simultaneously.

In preeclampsia, which can occur with or without pre-existing hypertension, affected women have hypertension, protein loss in the urine (proteinuria), and swelling (edema). In eclampsia, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizures</a> also occur and the hypertension requires emergency treatment. The baby must be delivered quickly as part of the treatment of the mother. The main goal of treating the high blood pressure in toxemia is to keep the diastolic pressure below 105 mm Hg in order to prevent a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_hemorrhage/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">brain hemorrhage</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epilepsy_and_seizures_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">seizures</a> in the mother.</p>.<p>Hypertension that develops before the 20th week of pregnancy almost always is due to pre-existing hypertension and not toxemia. High blood pressure that occurs only during pregnancy, called gestational hypertension, may start late in the pregnancy. Women with gestational hypertension do not have proteinuria, edema, or convulsions, and there appears to be no ill effects on the mother or fetus. This form of hypertension resolves shortly after delivery, although it may recur with subsequent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancies</a>.</p>.<p>The use of medications for hypertension during pregnancy is controversial. The risk of untreated mild to moderate hypertension to the fetus or mother during pregnancy probably is not very great. Lowering the blood pressure too much can interfere with the flow of blood to the placenta and impair fetal growth. Not all mild or moderate hypertension during pregnancy needs to be treated with medication.

Some antihypertensive medications are not recommended (contraindicated) during pregnancy. These include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ACE inhibitors</a>, ARB drugs, and diuretics. ACE inhibitors may aggravate a diminished blood supply to the uterus (uterine ischemia) and cause kidney dysfunction in the fetus. ARB drugs may lead to death of the fetus.

ACE inhibitors act by blocking (inhibiting) an enzyme that converts the inactive form of angiotensin in the blood to its active form. The active form of angiotensin constricts or narrows the arteries, but the inactive form cannot. With an ACE inhibitor as a single drug treatment (monotherapy), 50 to 60 percent of Caucasians usually achieve good blood pressure control. African American patients also may respond, but they may require higher doses and frequently do best when an ACE inhibitor is combined with a diuretic. (See the discussion of diurectics that follows.)</p>.<p>As an added benefit, ACE inhibitors may reduce an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_heart/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">enlarged heart</a> (left ventricular hypertrophy) in patients with hypertension. These drugs also appear to slow the deterioration of kidney function in patients with hypertension and protein in the urine (proteinuria). They have been particularly useful in slowing the progression of kidney dysfunction in hypertensive patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">kidney disease</a> resulting from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">type 1 diabetes</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">insulin</a>-dependent). ACE inhibitors usually are the first-line drugs to treat high blood pressure in patients who also have congestive heart failure, chronic kidney failure, and heart attack (myocardial infarction) that weakens the heart muscle (systolic dysfunction). ARB drugs currently are recommended for first-line kidney protection in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetic_peripheral_neuropathy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetic nephropathy</a> (kidney disease).</p>.<p>Patients treated with ACE inhibitors who also have kidney disease should be monitored for further deterioration in kidney function and high serum potassium.

ARB drugs work by blocking the angiotensin receptor (binder) on the arteries to which activated angiotensin must bind to have its effects. As a result, the angiotensin is not able to work on the artery. (Angiotensin is a hormone that constricts the arteries.) ARB drugs appear to have many of the same advantages as the ACE inhibitors but without the associated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cough</a>; however, edema still may occur. They are also suitable as first-line agents to treat hypertension.</p>.<p>ARB drugs include:</p>.<p>In patients who have hypertension in addition to certain second diseases, a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB drug may be effective in controlling the hypertension and also benefiting the second disease. This combination of drugs can treat hypertension and reduce the loss of protein in the urine (proteinuria) in certain kidney diseases and perhaps help strengthen the heart muscle in certain diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies). Both the ACE inhibitors and the ARB drugs are not to be used (contraindicated) in pregnant women.

The nerves of the sympathetic nervous system extend throughout the body and exert their effects by releasing chemicals that travel to nearby cells in the body. The released chemicals bind to receptors (molecules) on the surface of the nearby cells and stimulate or inhibit the function of the cells. In the heart and blood vessels, the receptors for the sympathetic nervous system that are most important are the beta receptors. When stimulated, beta-receptors in the heart increase the heart rate and the strength of heart contractions (pumping action). Beta-blocking drugs acting on the heart slow the heart rate and reduce the force of the heart's contraction.</p>.<p>Stimulation of beta-receptors in the smooth muscle of the peripheral arteries and in the airways of the lung causes these muscles to relax. Beta blockers cause contraction of the smooth muscle of the peripheral arteries and thereby decrease blood flow to body tissues. As a result, the patient may experience coolness in the hands and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>.

They work in the tiny tubes (tubules) of the kidneys to promote the removal of salt from the body. Water also may be removed along with the salt. Diuretics may be used as single drug treatment (monotherapy) for hypertension. More frequently low doses of diuretics are used in combination with other antihypertensive medications to enhance the effect of the other medications.</p>.<p>The diuretic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrochlorothiazide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">hydrochlorothiazide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrochlorothiazide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">HydroDIURIL</a>) works in the far end (distal) part of the kidney tubules to increase the amount of salt that is removed from the body in the urine. In a low dose of 12.5 to 25 mg per day, this diuretic may improve the blood pressure-lowering effects of other antihypertensive drugs, and the low doses also can prevent the fluid retention (edema) associated with ACE and ARB drugs. The idea is to treat the hypertension without causing adverse effects sometimes seen with higher doses of hydrochlorothiazide. These side effects include potassium depletion and elevated levels of triglyceride (fat), uric acid, and glucose (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sugar</a>) in the blood.</p>.<p>Occasionally, when salt retention causing accumulation of water and swelling (edema) is a major problem, the more potent 'loop' diuretics may be used in combination with other antihypertensive medications. The loop diuretics are so called because they work in the loop segment of the kidney tubules to eliminate salt.</p>.<p>The most commonly used diuretics to treat hypertension include hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chlorthalidone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">chlorthalidone</a>, the loop diuretics <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/furosemide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">furosemide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/furosemide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lasix</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/torsemide-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">torsemide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/torsemide-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Demadex</a>), the combination of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/triamterene_and_hydrochlorothiazide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide</a> (Dyazide), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metolazone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">metolazone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metolazone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zaroxolyn</a>).

Calcium is needed for these muscles to contract. Calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure by decreasing the force of the heart's pumping action and relaxing the muscle cells in the walls of the arteries.</p>.<p>Three major types of calcium channel blockers are used. One type is the dihydropyridines, which do not slow the heart rate or cause other abnormal heart rates or rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias).

One type is verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, and Verelan) and the other is diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, Dilacor, and Diltia). The non-dihydropyridines can cause slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia). The non-dihydropyridines are not recommended in congestive heart failure. Both the dihydropyridines and the non-dihydropyridines are very useful when used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.</p>.<p>Many of the calcium channel blockers come in a short-acting form and a long-acting (sustained release) form. The short-acting forms of the calcium channel blockers may have adverse long-term consequences, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">strokes</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a>. These effects are due to the wide fluctuations in the blood pressure and heart rate that occur during treatment resulting from the rapid onset and short duration of the short-acting compounds. When the calcium channel blockers are used in sustained release preparations less fluctuation occurs. The sustained release forms of calcium channel blockers are probably safer for long-term use. The main side effects of these drugs include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a>, swelling (edema), and a slow heart rate (only with the non-dihydropyridine types).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="alpha_blockers" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alpha blockers lower blood pressure by blocking alpha-receptors in the smooth muscle of peripheral arteries throughout the tissues of the body. The alpha-receptors are part of the sympathetic nervous system, as are the beta-receptors. The alpha-receptors, however, serve to constrict the peripheral arteries and the alpha-blockers cause the peripheral arteries to widen (dilate) and lower the blood pressure.</p>.<p>Evidence suggests using alpha blockers alone as a first-line drug choice for hypertension may actually increase the risk of heart-related problems, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_in_women/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a> or strokes.

That is, it works in a control center for the sympathetic nervous system in the brain. The drug is referred to as a central alpha agonist because it stimulates alpha-receptors in the brain. The result of this central stimulation is to decrease the sympathetic nervous system outflow and to decrease the stiffness (resistance) of the peripheral arteries. Clonidine lowers the blood pressure by relaxing (dilating or widening) the peripheral arteries throughout the body.

Rather, it is a muscle relaxant that works directly on the smooth muscle of the peripheral arteries throughout the body. Minoxidil is used for patients who have not responded to other medications. It must be combined with a beta blocker or clonidine to prevent an increase in the heart rate and with a diuretic to prevent retention of fluid (swelling). Minoxidil may also increase hair growth.</p>.<p><b><a name="renin_inhibitors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Aliskiren (Tekturna) is in a class of antihypertensive drugs called renin inhibitors. Renin is an enzyme in the chain of blood pressure regulating hormones referred to as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) hormonal system.</p>.<p>The first step in the chain is the production of renin in the kidneys when the kidneys detect lower blood pressure.

Certain antihypertensive medications may cause such side effects as fatigue and sexual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_pictures_slideshow_erectile_dysfunction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">impotence</a> which can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life and compliance with treatment. More resistant cases of hypertension that require higher doses of medication may cause more adverse effects, and therefore, less compliance.</p>.<p>In dosing schedules that require taking medication two to four times a day (split dose), some patients will remember to take their medicine only some of the time. In contrast, medications that can be given once daily tend to be remembered more regularly.</p>.<p>Expensive blood pressure medications, especially if insurance does not cover the costs, may also reduce compliance. People attempt to save money by skipping doses of the prescribed medication. The least expensive medication regimes use generic drugs, which are readily available for some of the diuretics and beta blockers. Lifestyle changes such as losing weight, reducing dietary sodium, decreasing consumption of alcohol, and exercising regularly, reduce the need for some medications.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_alternative_medicine_used_to_treat%0Ahigh_blood_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alternative medicine, also called integrative or complementary medicine, features the use of nontraditional (at least in the Western world) techniques for treatment. For example, self-relaxation approaches to the therapy of hypertension include yoga, biofeedback, and meditation. These techniques can be effective in lowering blood pressure, at least temporarily. In order to produce sustained reductions in the blood pressure these techniques may require hours of diligent adherence daily. They are generally practical only for a few highly motivated individuals with hypertension. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acupuncture/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Acupuncture</a> has not yet been established as a standard or proven therapy for hypertension in the Western world.</p>.<p>Certain herbal remedies have blood pressure-lowering components that may well be effective in treating hypertension. Most herbal remedies are available as food supplements and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them as drugs. Therefore, herbal treatments for hypertension have not yet been adequately evaluated in scientifically controlled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a> for effectiveness and safety. In particular, their long-term side effects are unknown. A major problem with most herbal treatments is that their contents are not standardized. The ways in which herbal treatments work to lower blood pressure are not known. For all of these reasons, herbal remedies usually are not recommended for the treatment of hypertension.</p>.<p>As mentioned previously, some supplements, such as garlic and flaxseed have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure. Some small-scale studies have shown that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may lower blood pressure, but further studies are needed. Other home remedies, such as calcium, magnesium, and fish oil have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure. Patients should consult their physicians before taking any supplement or home remedy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_high_blood_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p></p>.<p>High blood pressure (hypertension) increases the risk of developing heart (cardiac) disease, kidney (renal) disease, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), aneurysms, eye damage, and stroke (brain damage).</p>.<p>These complications of hypertension often are referred to as end-organ damage. Because of this damage, the diagnosis of high blood pressure is important so efforts can be made to normalize blood pressure and prevent complications.</p>.<p>People with high blood pressure have an increased stiffness, or resistance, in the arteries throughout the tissues of the body. This increased resistance causes the heart muscle to work harder to pump the blood through the arteries. The increased workload can put a strain on the heart, which can lead to heart abnormalities that are usually first seen as an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">enlarged heart</a> muscle. Heart enlargement may be a forerunner of heart failure, coronary (heart) artery disease, and abnormal heart rate or rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias). Proper treatment of the high blood pressure and its complications can reverse some of these heart abnormalities.</p>.<p>Blood and urine tests may be helpful in detecting kidney abnormalities in people with high blood pressure. (Kidney damage can be either the cause or the result of hypertension.) Measuring the serum <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/creatinine_blood_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">creatinine</a> in the blood can assess how well the kidneys are functioning. An elevated level of serum creatinine indicates damage to the kidneys. In addition, the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) may reflect chronic kidney damage from hypertension, even if kidney function (as represented by the blood creatinine level) is normal. African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension are at a higher risk than Caucasians for most end-organ damage and, particularly, kidney damage.</p>.<p>Uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) can cause strokes, which can lead to brain or neurological damage. The strokes are usually due to a hemorrhage (leaking blood) or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> (thrombosis) of the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain. The patient's symptoms and signs (findings on physical examination) are evaluated to assess the neurological damage. A stroke can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, tingling, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">paralysis</a> of the arms or legs and difficulties with speech or vision. Multiple small strokes can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dementia</a> (impaired intellectual capacity). The best prevention for this complication of hypertension or, for that matter, for any of the complications, is control of the blood pressure. Recent studies have also suggested the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angiotensin_ii_receptor_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ARBs</a> may offer an additional protective effect against strokes above and beyond control of blood pressure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_high_blood_pressure_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p></p>.<p>High blood pressure can sometimes be prevented if individuals follow a healthy lifestyle and:</p>.<p><b>Maintain a healthy weight.</b> Being overweight can make a person two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure.</p>.<p><b>Get regular exercise.</b> Physically active people have up to a 50% lower risk of getting high blood pressure than people who are not active.</p>.<p><b>Reduce salt intake.</b> Less than 4 grams per day is the goal.</p>.<p><b>Drink alcohol in moderation, or not at all.</b> Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure. If a person drinks alcohol, they should limit it to no more than two drinks a day.</p>.<p><b>Reduce stress.</b> Stress can raise blood pressure.</p>.<p><b><a name="whats_new_in_high_blood_pressure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A novel approach to hypertension treatment has been found by studying a hormone that controls insect growth. Butterfly researchers identified and characterized epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in a critical pathway in the breakdown of anti-inflammatory arachidonate metabolites called EETs, or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Other researchers found that inhibiting the breakdown of EETs reduced blood pressure in rodents. This newly discovered enzyme also reduced vascular inflammation and end-organ damage, the long-term effects of high blood pressure.</p>.<p>The oral form of the enzyme developed in this study, currently in clinical trials, reduced the most common type of high blood pressure in middle-aged individuals. Pharmaceutical companies in several countries have initiated programs using this enzyme to treat high blood pressure, inflammation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>, and other disorders.</p>.<p>A surgical procedure also is being tested in other countries to lower high blood pressure. The procedure involves disrupting the nerves to the kidney. A large trial of this did not demonstrate benefit in lowering blood pressure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
