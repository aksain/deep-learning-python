<p><b><a name="hypercalcemia_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="hypercalcemia_introduction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Calcium is a mineral that is important in the regulation and processes of many body functions including bone formation, hormone release, muscle contraction, and nerve and brain function. Hypercalcemia is the term that refers to elevated levels of calcium in the bloodstream.</p>.<p>Calcium levels are tightly regulated in the body. Calcium regulation is primarily controlled by parathyroid hormone (PTH), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutritional_health_vitamin_d_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin D</a>, and calcitonin. </p>.<p>Together, these three hormones act on the bones, the kidneys, and the GI tract to regulate calcium levels in the 
bloodstream. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_hypercalcemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>One of the most common causes of high calcium levels (hypercalcemia), is an overproduction of parathyroid hormone, or hyperparathyroidism. </p>.<p>Hypercalcemia can occur due to other medical conditions. These conditions can vary in severity and chronicity, and may be life-threatening. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Malignancy</a> is a common cause of elevated blood calcium. Up to 20% of individuals with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> will develop hypercalcemia at some point in their disease. </p>.<p>Other conditions associated with hypercalcemia include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_hypercalcemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the majority of patients with hypercalcemia, the signs and symptoms are minimal. In general, the symptoms increase with higher levels of calcium in the blood. In severe cases, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperparathyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">elevated calcium</a> levels can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abnormal heart rhythms</a> with specific findings on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrocardiogram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">EKG</a>).</p>.<p>Because of the clinical findings that are seen in hypercalcemia, the symptoms are often described as "moans, stones, groans, and bones". </p>.<p>Some of the symptoms include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hypercalcemia_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hypercalcemia is easily diagnosed with a blood test. Diagnosing the causes of hypercalcemia, however, is a more involved process; in addition to a detailed history and physical examination, it may require further blood tests (such as a PTH level and vitamin D level), urine evaluation, X-rays, and other imaging procedures.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_hypercalcemia_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment of elevated levels of calcium in the blood involves the evaluation of the following:</p>.<p>If the hypercalcemia is causing severe symptoms, or if the values are critically high, lowering the blood levels may require hospitalization and the use of hydration, steroids, or 
even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dialysis</a>. There are intravenous medications that can be used to lower calcium as well.</p>.<p>If the hypercalcemia is modest, treatment with medications can be administered on an outpatient basis. </p>.<p>If the underlying cause is hyperparathyroidism (particularly from an adenoma), there are certain criteria that are reviewed to discuss if surgery should be considered. These criteria include the absolute calcium level, a history of kidney stones or other calcium-related complications, and the amount of calcium seen in a 24-hour urine collection. Based on these findings, surgical removal of the adenoma may be considered. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_hypercalcemia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The results of treatment for hypercalcemia depend on the underlying cause of the condition. If hypercalcemia is seen in the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, the average 
30-day survival rate is about 50%. The prognosis is excellent for many of the other causes of hypercalcemia provided the underlying cause is addressed and treated.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_hypercalcemia_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hypercalcemia cannot be prevented, but early detection can both allow for normalization of calcium levels and lead to an early work-up to define the cause. If there is a known family history of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism, it is worth mentioning this to the health care practitioner; together the patient and health care practitioner can determine if screening is warranted.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
