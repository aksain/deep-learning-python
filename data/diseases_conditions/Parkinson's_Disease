<p><b><a name="parkinsons_definition_and_disease_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder. Characteristics of Parkinson’s disease are progressive loss of muscle control, which leads to trembling of the limbs and head while at rest, stiffness, slowness, and impaired balance. As symptoms worsen, it may become difficult to walk, talk, and complete simple tasks.</p>.<p>The progression of Parkinson's disease and the degree of impairment vary from person to person. Many people with Parkinson's disease live long productive lives, whereas others become disabled much more quickly. Complications of Parkinson’s such as falling-related injuries or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> can cause premature death. However, studies of patent populations with and without Parkinson’s Disease suggest the life expectancy for people with the disease is about the same as the general population.</p>.<p>Most individuals who develop Parkinson's disease are 60 years of age or older. Since overall life expectancy is rising, the number of individuals with Parkinson's disease will increase in the future. Adult-onset Parkinson's disease is most common, but early-onset Parkinson's disease (onset between 21-40 years), and juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (onset before age 21) can occur.</p>.<p>Descriptions of Parkinson's disease date back as far as 5000 BC. Around that time, an ancient Indian civilization called the disorder Kampavata and treated it with the seeds of a plant containing therapeutic levels of what is today known as levodopa. Parkinson's disease was named after the British doctor James Parkinson, who in 1817 first described the disorder in detail as "shaking palsy."<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_early_and_later_signs_and_symptoms_of_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease are all related to voluntary and involuntary motor function and usually start on one side of the body. Symptoms are mild at first and will progress over time. Some individuals are more affected than others are. Studies have shown that by the time that primary symptoms appear, individuals with Parkinson's disease will have lost 60% to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Characteristic motor symptoms include the following:</p>.<p><b>Secondary symptoms of Parkinson's disease</b></p>.<p>While the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are movement-related, progressive loss of muscle control and continued damage to the brain can lead to secondary symptoms. These vary in severity, and not every individual will experience all of them. Some of the secondary symptoms include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A substance called dopamine acts as a messenger between two brain areas - the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum - to produce smooth, controlled movements. Most of the movement-related symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by a lack of dopamine due to the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. When the amount of dopamine is too low, communication between the substantia nigra and corpus striatum becomes ineffective, and movement becomes impaired; the greater the loss of dopamine, the worse the movement-related symptoms. Other cells in the brain also degenerate to some degree and may contribute to non-movement related symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p>Although it is well known that lack of dopamine causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, it is not clear why the dopamine-producing brain cells deteriorate. Genetic and pathological studies have revealed that various dysfunctional cellular processes, inflammation, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> can all contribute to cell damage. In addition, abnormal clumps called Lewy bodies, which contain the protein alpha-synuclein, are found in many brain cells of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The function of these clumps in regards to Parkinson's disease is not understood. In general, scientists suspect that dopamine loss is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_stages_of_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Researchers may disagree on the number of stages of Parkinson’s disease (range from 3-5 stages), however, they all agree that the disease is progressive with symptoms that usually occur in one stage, and may overlap or occur in another stage. The stage increase in number value for all stage naming systems reflect the increasing severity of the disease. The stages used by the Parkinson’s Foundation will be reviewed.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_parkinsons_disease_inherited_genetic" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most individuals, Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, which means that it arises sporadically with no known cause. However, some of individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's also have family members with the disease. By studying families with hereditary Parkinson's disease, scientists have identified several genes that are associated with the disorder. Studying these genes helps understand the cause of Parkinson's disease and may lead to new therapies. So far, five genes have been identified that are definitively associated with Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p>Several other chromosome regions and the genes GBA (glucosidase beta acid), SNCAIP (synuclein alpha interacting protein), and UCHL1 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1) may also be linked to Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_conditions_resemble_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In its early stages, Parkinson's disease can resemble a number of other conditions with Parkinson-like symptoms known as Parkinsonism. These conditions include multiple system atrophy, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/progressive_supranuclear_palsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">progressive supranuclear palsy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/corticobasal_degeneration_cbd_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">corticobasal degeneration</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lewy_body_dementia_dementia_with_lewy_bodies/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Lewy body dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalitis</a> (inflammation of the brain), and head trauma. Alzheimer's disease and primary lateral sclerosis can also be mistaken for Parkinson's disease. Other similar conditions include essential <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">tremor</a>, dystonic tremor, vascular Parkinsonism, and drug-induced Parkinsonism.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_test_to_diagnose_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is important in developing good treatment strategies to maintain a high quality of life for as long as possible. However, there is no test to diagnose Parkinson's disease with certainty (except after the individual has passed away). A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease - especially in the early phase - can be challenging due to similarities to related movement disorders and other conditions with Parkinson-like symptoms. Individuals may sometimes be misdiagnosed as having another disorder, and sometimes individuals with Parkinson-like symptoms may be inaccurately diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. It is therefore important to re-evaluate individuals in the early phase on a regular basis to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms.</p>.<p>A neurologist who specializes in movement disorders will be able to make the most accurate diagnosis. An initial assessment is made based on medical history, a neurological exam, and the symptoms present. For the medical history, it is important to know whether other family members have Parkinson's disease, what types of medication have been or are being taken, and whether there was exposure to toxins or repeated head trauma previously. A neurological exam may include an evaluation of coordination, walking, and fine motor tasks involving the hands.</p>.<p>Several guidelines have been published to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. These include the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Tests are used to measure mental capacity, behavior, mood, daily living activities, and motor function. They can be very helpful in the initial diagnosis, to rule out other disorders, as well as in monitoring the progression of the disease to make therapeutic adjustments. Brain scans and other laboratory tests are also sometimes carried out, mostly to detect other disorders resembling Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is more likely if:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is currently no treatment to cure Parkinson's disease. Several therapies are available to delay the onset of motor symptoms and to ameliorate motor symptoms. All of these therapies are designed to increase the amount of dopamine in the brain either by replacing dopamine, mimicking dopamine, or prolonging the effect of dopamine by inhibiting its breakdown. Studies have shown that early therapy in the non-motor stage can delay the onset of motor symptoms, thereby extending quality of life.</p>.<p>The most effective therapy for Parkinson's disease is levodopa (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levodopa-carbidopa/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sinemet</a>), which is converted to dopamine in the brain. However, because long-term treatment with levodopa can lead to unpleasant side effects (a shortened response to each dose, painful cramps, and involuntary movements), its use is often delayed until motor impairment is more severe. Levodopa is frequently prescribed together with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/carbidopa-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">carbidopa</a> (Sinemet), which prevents levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain. Co-treatment with carbidopa allows for a lower levodopa dose, thereby reducing side effects.</p>.<p>In earlier stages of Parkinson's disease, substances that mimic the action of dopamine (dopamine agonists), and substances that reduce the breakdown of dopamine (monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors) can be very efficacious in relieving motor symptoms. Unpleasant side effects of these preparations are quite common, including swelling caused by fluid accumulation in body tissues, drowsiness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation_myths_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">constipation</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dizziness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">hallucinations</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>.</p>.<p>For some individuals with advanced, virtually unmanageable motor symptoms, surgery may be an option. In <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_brain_stimulation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS), the surgeon implants electrodes to stimulate areas of the brain involved in movement. In another type of surgery, specific areas in the brain that cause Parkinson's symptoms are destroyed.</p>.<p>An alternative approach that has been explored is the use of dopamine-producing cells derived from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stem_cells/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stem cells</a>. While stem cell therapy has great potential, more research is required before such cells can become of therapeutic value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p>In addition to medication and surgery, general lifestyle changes (rest and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>), physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy may be beneficial.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_and_life_expectancy_for_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms varies greatly from individual to individual and it is not possible to predict how quickly the disorder will progress. Parkinson's disease itself is not a fatal disease, and the average life expectancy is similar to that of people without the disease. Secondary complications, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a>, falling-related injuries, and choking can lead to death. There are many treatment options that can reduce some of the symptoms and can prolong the quality of life of an individual with Parkinson's disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_parkinsons_disease_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Scientists currently believe that Parkinson's disease is triggered through a complex combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental factors such as toxins, illness, and trauma. Since the exact causes are not known, Parkinson's disease is at present not preventable.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_people_learn_to_cope_with_parkinsons_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although Parkinson's disease progresses slowly, it will eventually affect every aspect of life - from social engagements, work, to basic routines. Accepting the gradual loss of independence can be difficult. Being well informed about the disease can reduce anxiety about what lies ahead. Many support groups offer valuable information for individuals with Parkinson's disease and their families on how to cope with the disorder. Local groups can provide emotional support as well as advice on where to find experienced doctors, therapists, and related information. It is also very important to stay in close contact with health care professionals to monitor the progression of the disease and to adjust therapies to maintain the highest quality of living.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
