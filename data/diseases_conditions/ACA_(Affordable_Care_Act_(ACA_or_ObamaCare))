What follows are Mr. Lee's concepts of the future health-care landscape as he relayed them to me. --</em><strong> William C. Shiel Jr. MD, FACP, FACR</strong></p>.<p>The entire health-care industry is poised for the most profound changes in several generations. These changes can be categorized into Market Changes and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA is the most visible and most talked about driver of change, there are also numerous, less conspicuous factors that are already altering the way care is delivered and how it is paid for.</p>.<p>The ultimate decision supported by the 2012 presidential election is that the ACA will be the "rule of the land" and its continued evolutions have put additional stresses on providers of every discipline and size. Namely, providers of health care can expect the following changes:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_major_changes_to_medical_insurance_how_does_the_aca_affect_medicare" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Numerous other factors that are placing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> on health-care providers began prior to the ACA and remain an integral portion of reform. These include the following:</p>.<p>As the landscape changes, some of the key provisions that affect beneficiaries are as follows:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_benefits_of_the_affordable_care_act" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In response to these changes, hospital, health systems, and physicians will need greater emphasis on primary and preventative care, greater attention to standardization of care, and greater patient participation in high-value health-care decisions. This will require significant investment in clinical decisions support systems, realignment of the physician compensation models to create appropriate incentives as insurance requirements, and system-wide changes in patient management.</p>.<p>Cost containment is vital and focus must be on where drivers are, namely chronic conditions, implantable devices, and pharmaceuticals. Forward-thinking organizations must look to decisions around cost containment and ultimately closing the value gap. It would appear, though, that closing the value gap is generally concentrating on one side of the equation. Providers overwhelmingly aim for their organizations' reputations to be based on high quality and patient satisfaction. Providers do not seek to be known as the low-cost provider in today's health-care environment.</p>.<p>Ultimately, the ACA's goal is to increase the quality of health-care delivered as well as increase coverage to the uninsured. It is also the intent of the ACA and the other market drivers to sustain the Medicare program financially. As of May 31, 2013, it was estimated by the program's trustees that Medicare will be sustained until 2026, two additional years from previous estimates.</p>.<p>Though the implementation of the ACA is in phases, the most significant reimbursement impacts to providers will begin in Oct. 2013 with changes in the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program. Providers have begun to react, however, in preparation for the changes on the horizon.</p>.<p><i>Editorial note by Charles P. Davis, MD, PhD</i></p>.<p><i>There are many specific questions that remain about the true cost and true benefits to those who provide and to those who need health care. Some of these questions are inferred by this general article. The answers to these questions should begin to come as each ACA phase quickly matures. If the ACA phase enhances the health care of most individuals without damaging the health-care system, ACA and its phase may be deemed a success. However, if ACA damages the health care of many individuals (for example, provides limited access to physicians, creates long waits for diagnostic tests, medical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> become scarce commodities, or patients have poor health-care experiences) or damages the health-care system (for example, fewer doctors, a decline in the quality of medical-school applicants, spiraling costs, and hospital and emergency department closures), the ACA or that ACA phase will be considered a failure. That ACA phase will require quick and effective revision if quality health care is to survive and advance in the U.S. Many potential patients, doctors, and health-care professionals are concerned that provisions in the ACA may not be appropriately amenable to revisions if problems develop.</i></p>.<p><i>The ACA is 974 pages long and divided into 10 sections. While short summaries are useful to obtain some general understanding of this massive change in health care, for a more complete grasp of this law, it is best to read all of its details.
