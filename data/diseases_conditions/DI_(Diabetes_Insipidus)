The large volume of urine is diluted, mostly water. To make up for lost water, a person with 
diabetes insipidus may feel the need to drink large amounts and is likely to urinate frequently, even at night, which can disrupt <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a> and, on occasion, cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bedwetting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bedwetting</a>. Because of the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine, people with 
diabetes insipidus may quickly become 
dehydrated if they do not drink enough water. Children with 
diabetes insipidus may be irritable or listless and may have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. Milder forms of 
diabetes insipidus can be managed by drinking enough water, usually between 2 and 2.5 liters a day. 
Diabetes insipidus severe enough to endanger a person's health is rare.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_difference_between_diabetes_insipidus_and_diabetes_mellitus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Diabetes insipidus should not be confused with diabetes mellitus (DM), which results from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insulin</a> deficiency or resistance leading to high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood glucose</a>, also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/reasons_for_blood_sugar_swings_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood sugar</a>. 
Diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus are unrelated, although they can have similar signs and symptoms, like excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thirst/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thirst</a> and excessive urination.
</p>.<p>
Diabetes mellitus is far more common than diabetes insipidus and receives more news coverage. 
Diabetes mellitus has two main forms, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 1 diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 2 diabetes</a>. 
Diabetes insipidus is a different form of illness altogether.
</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_fluid_in_the_body_normally_regulated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The body has a complex system for balancing the volume and composition of body fluids. The kidneys remove extra body fluids from the bloodstream. These fluids are stored in the bladder as urine. If the fluid regulation system is working properly, the kidneys make less urine to conserve fluid when water intake is decreased or water is lost, for example, through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sweating</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. The kidneys also make less urine at night when the body's metabolic processes are slower.</p>.<p>
</p>.<p>To keep the volume and composition of body fluids balanced, the rate of fluid intake is governed by thirst, and the rate of excretion is governed by the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin. This hormone is made in the hypothalamus, a small gland located in the brain. ADH is stored in the nearby <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pituitary_gland_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pituitary gland</a> and released into the bloodstream when necessary. When ADH reaches the kidneys, it directs them to concentrate the urine by reabsorbing some of the filtered water to the bloodstream and therefore make less urine. 
Diabetes insipidus occurs when this precise system for regulating the kidneys' handling of fluids is disrupted.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_diabetes_insipidus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
<b>Central Diabetes Insipidus</b>
</p>.<p>
The most common form of serious diabetes insipidus, central diabetes insipidus, results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of ADH. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by 
head injuries, neurosurgery, or 
genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times. The drug prevents water excretion, and water can build up now that the kidneys are making less urine and are less responsive to changes in body fluids.</p>.<p>
<b>Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus</b></p>.<p>

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results when the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH. The kidneys' ability to respond to ADH can be impaired by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>-like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lithium/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lithium</a>, for example-and by chronic disorders including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polycystic_kidney_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">polycystic kidney disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sickle cell disease</a>, kidney failure, partial blockage of the ureters, and inherited genetic disorders. Sometimes the cause of nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus is never discovered.
</p>.<p>
Desmopressin will not work for this form of diabetes insipidus. Instead, a person with nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus may be given <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrochlorothiazide/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hydrochlorothiazide</a> (HCTZ) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/indomethacin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">indomethacin</a>. HCTZ is sometimes combined with another drug called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amiloride-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amiloride</a>. The combination of HCTZ and amiloride is sold under the brand name Moduretic. Again, with this combination of drugs, one should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times.</p>.<p>
<b>Dipsogenic Diabetes insipidus</b></p>.<p>

Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by a defect in or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake that suppresses ADH secretion and increases urine output. Desmopressin or other drugs should not be used to treat dipsogenic 
diabetes insipidus because they may decrease urine output but not thirst and fluid intake. This fluid overload can lead to water intoxication, a condition that lowers the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concentration</a> of sodium in the blood and can seriously damage the brain. Scientists have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic 
diabetes insipidus.</p>.<p>
<b>Gestational Diabetes Insipidus</b></p>.<p>

Gestational diabetes insipidus occurs only 
during 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> and results when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in the mother. The placenta is the system of blood vessels and other tissue that develops with the fetus. The placenta allows exchange of nutrients and waste products between mother and fetus.</p>.<p>

Most cases of gestational diabetes insipidus can be treated with desmopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational 
diabetes insipidus, and desmopressin should not be used.
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_diabetes_insipidus_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because diabetes mellitus is more common and because diabetes mellitus and 
diabetes insipidus have similar symptoms, a health care provider may suspect that a patient with 
diabetes insipidus has diabetes mellitus. But testing should make the diagnosis clear.
</p>.<p>
A doctor must determine which type of diabetes insipidus is involved before proper treatment can begin. Diagnosis is based on a series of tests, including urinalysis and a fluid deprivation test.
</p>.<p>
Urinalysis is the physical and chemical examination of urine. The urine of a person with 
diabetes insipidus will be less concentrated. Therefore, the salt and waste concentrations are low and the amount of water excreted is high. A physician evaluates the concentration of urine by measuring how many particles are in a kilogram of water or by comparing the weight of the urine with an equal volume of distilled water.
</p>.<p>
A fluid deprivation test helps determine whether diabetes insipidus is caused by one of the following:
</p>.<p>

This test measures changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH during this test is also necessary.
</p>.<p>
In some patients, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>) of the brain may be necessary as well.
