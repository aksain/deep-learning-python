The stomach receives food, mixes it with acid and digestive juices and turns it into a clean slurry that is pushed through the three parts of small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) where the nutrients are absorbed into the body. The refuse is dumped into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">large intestine</a>, or colon, where water is absorbed and the feces become more solid and are eliminated from the body.</p>.<p>The normal bacteria (flora) of the gut, perform important functions, helping to digest certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/folic_acid-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">folic acid</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_k-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin K</a>, and they protect the intestine from being invaded by disease causing bacteria. However, if the normal function of the intestine is compromised, bacterial overgrowth may occur. This may be the result of a lack of adequate stomach acid, damage to the intestine by toxins like alcohol, or a decrease in the speed at which the small intestine transfers material to the colon.</p>.<p>The colon is not as clean as the small intestine and reflux, or backflow, of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a> into the small intestine can colonize it with colonic bacteria.</p>.<p>This article will discuss only the type of SIBO associated with intestinal diseases and conditions.</p>.<p><b><a name="associated_sibo_types_of_other_diseases_or_conditions_associated_with_it" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Small intestine bowel overgrowth is often associated with another illness that affects the function of the small intestine. The body has many protective mechanisms to keep bacteria under control, including stomach acidity and intestinal motility, the ability for the intestine to move its contents downstream at an appropriate speed. Bacterial growth is hindered by the presence of bile and immunoglobulins. Finally, the ileocecal valve prevents <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a> from refluxing from the colon (large intestine) into the ileum or the last part of the small intestine.</p>.<p>Any illness or disease that affects the body's defense mechanism puts a person at risk for SIBO, but the majority of people develop SIBO because of a problem with intestinal anatomy or intestinal muscle. These may include abnormal anatomy of the intestines caused by surgery (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastric_bypass_surgery/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">gastric bypass surgery</a>, bypassed intestine), bowel strictures and adhesions that can lead to intermittent bowel obstructions, diverticuli or outpouchings of the small intestine, and tumors. Bowel motility may be affected by neurologic diseases including myotonic dystrophy and Parkinson's disease and a rare condition called intestinal pseudoobstruction. People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> with autonomic dysfunction (nerve damage) that affects intestinal muscle also may develop dysmotility.</p>.<p>Any illness or disease that affects the body's defense mechanism puts a person at risk for SIBO, but the majority of people develop SIBO because of an intestinal motility problem.

The clues may come from illnesses associated with malabsorption of proteins, fats and vitamins. When there is malabsorption it is important to look for SIBO.</p>.<p>Blood tests may be ordered looking for different causes of anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and vitamin deficiencies.</p>.<p>Breath tests may be considered to diagnose SIBO by looking for the byproducts of digestion , especially those produced by bacteria. Upper GI endoscopy allows a gastroenterologist to look at the inside of the upper part of the small intestine and take biopsies or small bits of tissue that can be examined under the microscope. Biopsies can determine if there is damage to the lining of the intestine that may be giving rise to the symptoms either through the mechanism of bacterial overgrowth or via another mechanism.</p>.<p>While these diagnostics tests are being performed, it is appropriate for the health care professional to look for conditions that are associated with SIBO. If such a condition is already known, then maximizing treatment of the associated condition may be undertaken at the same time the diagnosis of whichÂ SIBO is being considered and tested.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="antibiotic_and_probiotic_treatment_for_sibo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for SIBO includes controlling and treating any underlying associated illness. The goal is to control the symptoms of small intestine bacterial overgrowth since it may not be possible to "cure" the disease.</p>.<p>Antibiotics are one of the treatments that are helpful in controlling the excess bacteria. It is important that not all the bacteria in the intestine are eradicated, since some are required to help with normal digestion.</p>.<p>Amoxillin-clavulanate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amoxicillin_and_clavulanic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Augmentin</a>) and rifaxamin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rifaximin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Xifaxan</a>) are the two common first line antibiotics that may be prescribed. Depending upon the situation, other antibiotics may also be considered, including:</p>.<p>While a single course of antibiotics for 1-2 weeks may be sufficient, SIBO has a tendency to relapse, and sometimes repeated courses of antibiotics may be required. In some people, the antibiotics will be routinely cycled, meaning that they will alternate a 1-2 weeks on the antibiotic with 1-2 weeks off.</p>.<p>In addition, underlying vitamin and nutrient deficiencies due to malabsorption should be treated.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_the_condition_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Since SIBO usually is a secondary illness that occurs because the intestine has in some way been affected by another disease, it is important to keep chronic diseases properly treated and under control as best as possible.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_sibo_relapse_whats_the_prognosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Small intestine bacterial overgrowth is usually associated with another underlying illness. Even with appropriate treatment, the relapse rate is high and often depends upon how well the underlying illness is managed and controlled.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
