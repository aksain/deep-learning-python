The weeks are grouped into three trimesters (TREYE-mess-turs). Find out what's happening with you and your baby in these three stages.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_first_trimester_of_pregnancy_week_1-week_12" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">first trimester</a> your body undergoes many changes. Hormonal changes affect almost every organ system in your body. These changes can trigger symptoms even in the very first weeks of pregnancy. Your period stopping is a clear sign that you are pregnant. Other changes may include:</p>.<p>As your body changes, you might need to make changes to your daily routine, such as going to bed earlier or eating frequent, small meals. Fortunately, most of these discomforts will go away as your pregnancy progresses. And some women might not feel any discomfort at all! If you have been pregnant before, you might feel differently this time around. Just as each woman is different, so is each pregnancy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_second_trimester_of_pregnancy_week_13-week_28" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most women find the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/second_trimester_16_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">second trimester</a> of pregnancy easier than the first. But it is just as important to stay informed about your pregnancy during these months.</p>.<p>You might notice that symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a> are going away. But other new, more noticeable changes to your body are now happening. Your abdomen will expand as the baby continues to grow. And before this trimester is over, you will feel your baby beginning to move!</p>.<p>As your body changes to make room for your growing baby, you may have:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_third_trimester_trimester_of_pregnancy_week_29-week_40" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You're in the home stretch! Some of the same discomforts you had in your second trimester will continue. Plus, many women find <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> difficult and notice they have to go to the bathroom even more often. This is because the baby is getting bigger and it is putting more pressure on your organs. Don't worry, your baby is fine and these problems will lessen once you give birth.</p>.<p>Some new body changes you might notice in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/third_trimester_32_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">third trimester</a> include:</p>.<p>As you near your due date, your cervix becomes thinner and softer (called effacing). This is a normal, natural process that helps the birth canal to open during the birthing process. Your doctor will check your progress with a vaginal exam as you near your due date.

Get the low-down on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/stretch_marks_white_striae_axilla_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stretch marks</a>, weight gain, heartburn and other "joys" of pregnancy. Find out what you can do to feel better.</p>.<p><b><a name="body_aches" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As your uterus expands, you may feel aches and pains in the back, abdomen, groin area, and thighs. Many women also have backaches and aching near the pelvic bone due the pressure of the baby's head, increased weight, and loosening joints. Some pregnant women complain of pain that runs from the lower back, down the back of one leg, to the knee or foot. This is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sciatica/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sciatica</a> (SYE-AT-ick-uh). It is thought to occur when the uterus puts pressure on the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sciatica_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sciatic nerve</a>.</p>.<p><b>What might help:</b></p>.<p>The pain does not get better.</p>.<p><b><a name="breast_changes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>During pregnancy, you might have:</b></p>.<p>A woman's breasts increase in size and fullness during pregnancy. As the due date approaches, hormone changes will cause your breasts to get even bigger to prepare for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breastfeeding</a>. Your breasts may feel full, heavy, or tender.</p>.<p>In the third trimester, some pregnant women begin to leak colostrum (coh-LOSS-truhm) from their breasts. Colostrum is the first milk that your breasts produce for the baby. It is a thick, yellowish fluid containing antibodies that protect newborns from infection.</p>.<p>You feel a lump or have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nipple</a> changes or discharge (that is not colostrum) or skin changes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="constipation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many pregnant women complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation_myths_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a>. Signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> include having hard, dry stools; fewer than three bowel movements per week; and painful bowel movements.</p>.<p>Higher levels of hormones due to pregnancy slow down <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">digestion</a> and relax muscles in the bowels leaving many women constipated. Plus, the pressure of the expanding uterus on the bowels can contribute to constipation.</p>.<p>If constipation does not go away.</p>.<p><b><a name="dizziness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>During pregnancy, you might have:</b></p>.<p>Many pregnant women complain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lightheadedness</a> throughout their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancies</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fainting</a> is rare but does happen even in some healthy pregnant women. There are many reasons for these symptoms. The growth of more blood vessels in early pregnancy, the pressure of the expanding uterus on blood vessels, and the body's increased need for food all can make a pregnant woman feel lightheaded and dizzy.</p>.<p>You feel faint and have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal bleeding</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="fatigue_sleep_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During your pregnancy, you might feel tired even after you've had a lot of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. Many women find they're exhausted in the first trimester. Don't worry, this is normal! This is your body's way of telling you that you need more rest. In the second trimester, tiredness is usually replaced with a feeling of well being and energy. But in the third trimester, exhaustion often sets in again. As you get larger, sleeping may become more difficult. The baby's movements, bathroom runs, and an increase in the body's metabolism might interrupt or disturb your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. Leg cramping can also interfere with a good night's sleep.</p>.<p><b><a name="heartburn_and_indigestion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hormones and the pressure of the growing uterus cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">indigestion</a> and heartburn. Pregnancy hormones slow down the muscles of the digestive tract. So food tends to move more slowly and digestion is sluggish. This causes many pregnant women to feel bloated.</p>.<p>Hormones also relax the valve that separates the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a> from the stomach. This allows food and acids to come back up from the stomach to the esophagus. The food and acid causes the burning feeling of heartburn. As your baby gets bigger, the uterus pushes on the stomach making heartburn more common in later pregnancy.</p>.<p><b>Call the doctor if:</b></p>.<p>Symptoms don't improve after trying these suggestions. Ask your doctor about using an antacid.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="hemorrhoids_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemorrhoids_piles_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hemorrhoids</a> (HEM-roidz) are swollen and bulging veins in the rectum. They can cause itching, pain, and bleeding. Up to 50 percent of pregnant women get hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are common during pregnancy for many reasons. During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly, which can cause veins to enlarge. The expanding uterus also puts pressure on the veins in the rectum. Plus, constipation can worsen hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids usually improve after delivery.</p>.<p><b><a name="itching" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>During pregnancy, you might have:</b></p>.<p>About 20 percent of pregnant women feel <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itchy</a> during pregnancy. Usually women feel <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itchy</a> in the abdomen. But red, itchy palms and soles of the feet are also common complaints. Pregnancy hormones and stretching skin are probably to blame for most of your discomfort. Usually the itchy feeling goes away after delivery.</p>.<p><b>Call the doctor if:</b></p>.<p>Symptoms don't improve after a week of self-care.</p>.<p><b><a name="leg_cramps" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>At different times during your pregnancy, you might have sudden <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">muscle spasms</a> in your legs or feet. They usually occur at night. This is due to a change in the way your body processes calcium.</p>.<p><b><a name="morning_sickness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the first trimester hormone changes can cause nausea and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>. This is called "morning sickness," although it can occur at any time of day. Morning sickness usually tapers off by the second trimester.</p>.<p>You have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu</a>-like symptoms, which may signal a more serious condition.</p>.<p>You have severe, constant nausea and/or vomiting several times every day.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="nasal_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness are common during pregnancy. They are caused by the increased amount of blood in your body and hormones acting on the tissues of your nose.</p>.<p>Nosebleeds are frequent and do not stop after a few minutes.</p>.<p><b><a name="numb_or_tingling_hands" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Feelings of swelling, tingling, and numbness in fingers and hands, called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/carpal_tunnel_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, can occur during pregnancy. These symptoms are due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swelling of tissues</a> in the narrow passages in your wrists, and they should disappear after delivery.</p>.<p><b><a name="stretch_marks_skin_changes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Stretch marks are red, pink, or brown streaks on the skin. Most often they appear on the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, and breasts. These <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scars</a> are caused by the stretching of the skin, and usually appear in the second half of pregnancy.</p>.<p>Some women notice other skin changes during pregnancy. For many women, the nipples become darker and browner during pregnancy. Many pregnant women also develop a dark line (called the linea nigra) on the skin that runs from the belly button down to the pubic hairline. Patches of darker skin usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip also are common. Patches often match on both sides of the face. These spots are called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melasma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">melasma</a> or chloasma and are more common in darker-skinned women.</p>.<p><b><a name="swelling" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>During pregnancy, you might have:</b></p>.<p>Many women develop mild swelling in the face, hands, or ankles at some point in their pregnancies. As the due date approaches, swelling often becomes more noticeable.</p>.<p>Your hands or feet swell suddenly or you rapidly gain weight - it may be preeclampsia.</p>.<p><b><a name="urinary_frequency_and_leaking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Temporary bladder control problems are common in pregnancy. Your unborn baby pushes down on the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles. This pressure can lead to more frequent need to urinate, as well as leaking of urine when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sneezing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a>, or laughing.</p>.<p><b><a name="varicose_veins" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly. This can cause veins to enlarge. Plus, pressure on the large veins behind the uterus causes the blood to slow in its return to the heart. For these reasons, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/varicose_veins/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">varicose veins</a> in the legs and anus (hemorrhoids) are more common in pregnancy.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spider_and_varicose_veins_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Varicose veins</a> look like swollen veins raised above the surface of the skin. They can be twisted or bulging and are dark purple or blue in color. They are found most often on the backs of the calves or on the inside of the leg.</p>
