Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas. This release of insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into body cells.

Control of blood glucose levels is only one goal of a healthy eating plan. A diabetic diet helps achieve and maintain a normal body weight, while preventing the common cardiac and vascular complications of diabetes.</p>.<p>There is no prescribed diet plan for diabetes and no single “<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetic_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes diet</a>”. Eating plans are tailored to fit each individual's needs, schedules, and eating habits. Each diabetes diet plan must be balanced with the intake of insulin and other diabetes medications. In general, the principles of a healthy diabetes diet are the same for everyone. Consumption of various foods in a healthy diet includes whole grains, fruits, non-fat dairy products, beans, lean meats, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vegetarian_diet_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">vegetarian</a> substitutes, poultry, or fish.</p>.<p>People with diabetes may benefit from eating small meals throughout the day, instead of eating one or two heavy meals.

Before being absorbed into the bloodstream, enzymes in the small intestine must break down carbohydrates into smaller sugar particles, such as glucose. One of the enzymes involved in breaking down carbohydrates is called alpha-glucosidase.

An enzyme called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) removes incretin from your body. Stopping (inhibiting) DPP-4 helps the incretin that is in the body to stay there longer. This triggers insulin to be released, which lowers blood sugar.</p>.<p>In 2006, the FDA approved the first drug in this class called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sitagliptin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sitagliptin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sitagliptin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Januvia</a>).

They are not associated with weight gain.</p>.<p><b><a name="glp-1_receptor_agonists" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin, a hormone that signals the body to release insulin after eating. A GLP-1 agonist drug works in a similar manner to DPP-4 inhibitors, by stimulating action of the incretin GLP-1. GLP-1 agonists are also known as incretin mimetics. Their effects are stronger than those of the DPP-4 inhibitors.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exenatide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Exenatide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exenatide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Byetta</a>) was the first drug of the GLP-1 agonist group. It originated from an interesting source, the saliva of the Gila monster. Scientists observed that this small lizard could go a long time without eating. They discovered a substance in its saliva that slowed stomach emptying, thus making the lizard feel fuller for a longer time. This substance resembled the hormone GLP-1.</p>.<p>Other drugs in this class have since been developed. They include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liraglutide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">liraglutide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liraglutide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Victoza</a>), long-acting exenatide (Bydureon), albiglutide (Tanzeum), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trulicity_dulaglutide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dulaglutide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trulicity_dulaglutide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Trulicity</a>).</p>.<p>These drugs slow stomach emptying and slows the release of glucose from the liver, thereby regulating delivery of nutrients to the intestine for absorption. They may also work in the brain to regulate hunger and are therefore associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">weight loss</a>.</p>.<p>GLP-1 receptor agonists are often associated with some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weight loss</a>.

Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of human amylin, a naturally occurring hormone made by the pancreas to help control glucose after meals. Similar to insulin, amylin is absent or deficient in person with diabetes.</p>.<p>Pramlintide used with insulin reduces post-meal blood sugar peaks, reduces glucose fluctuations throughout the day, enhances satiety (the sensation of fullness) leading to potential weight loss, and lowers mealtime insulin requirements.</p>.<p>Pramlintide is administered by injection just prior to meals (three times each day) for type 1 diabetes as an additional treatment to mealtime insulin therapy for those failing to achieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy and type 2 diabetes as an additional treatment to mealtime insulin therapy for those failing to achieve desired glucose control with optimal insulin therapy.</p>.<p>Pramlintide with insulin has been associated with an increased risk of insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia, particularly in type 1 diabetes. This severe hypoglycemia occurs within 3 hours of injecting pramlintide.

There are many, many more combination pills available.</p>.<p>These combination drugs carry the benefit of taking fewer pills, which hopefully improves compliance. While they work well, most health-care professionals initiate individual medications to optimize dosing, before switching to a combination pill once the patient has been stable on individual medications for a while.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_of_diabetes_with_insulin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Insulin remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes. Insulin is also important therapy for type 2 diabetes when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise, and oral medications.</p>.<p>Ideally, insulin should be administered in a manner that mimics the natural pattern of insulin secretion by a healthy pancreas. However, the complex pattern of natural insulin secretion is difficult to duplicate. Still, adequate blood glucose control can be achieved with careful attention to diet, regular exercise, home blood glucose monitoring, and multiple insulin injections throughout the day..</p>.<p>Various formulations of insulin differ in the pharmacokinetics, i.e., the amount of time until they begin to work and the duration of their action after injection. These different insulins allow for more tailored regimens to optimize blood sugar control. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_for_diabetes_treatment_types_side_effects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">types of insulin</a> currently available are:</p>.<p><b><a name="different_methods_of_delivering_insulin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Not only is the variety of insulin preparations growing, so are the methods for administering insulin.</p>.<p>In the twentieth century, insulin was available only in an injectable form that required carrying syringes, needles, vials of insulin, and alcohol swabs. Clearly, patients found it difficult to take multiple shots each day; as a result, good blood sugar control was often difficult. Many pharmaceutical companies now offer discreet and convenient methods for delivering insulin.</p>.<p>Many manufacturers offer pen delivery systems. Such systems resemble the ink cartridge in a fountain pen. A small, pen-sized device holds an insulin cartridge (usually containing 300 units). Cartridges are available for the most widely used insulin formulations. The amount of insulin to be injected is dialed in, by turning the bottom of the pen until the required number of units is seen in the dose-viewing window. The tip of the pen consists of a needle that is replaced with each injection. A release mechanism allows the needle to penetrate just under the skin and deliver the required amount of insulin.</p>.<p>An insulin pump is composed of a reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump, and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered. The pump is attached to a thin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> tube (an infusion set) that has a cannula (like a needle but soft) at the end through which insulin passes. This cannula is inserted under the skin, usually on the abdomen.. The pump continuously delivers insulin, 24 hours a day. The amount of insulin is programmed and is administered at a constant rate (basal rate). Often, the amount of insulin needed over the course of 24 hours varies, depending on factors like exercise, activity level, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>. The insulin pump allows the user to program many different basal rates to allow for variations in lifestyle. The user can also program the pump to deliver additional insulin during meals, covering the excess demands for insulin caused by eating carbohydrates.</p>.<p>The most exciting innovation in pump technology has been the ability to combine the pump in tandem with newer glucose sensing technology. This is called sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy.</p>.<p>A newer option involves devices that use sensors that communicate directly with the insulin pump. One device is approved by the FDA that is a hybrid system (not fully automated), in which the basal insulin doses are automatically adjusted depending on results from the sensor. Users need to manually request insulin doses prior to meals.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="alternative_treatments_for_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There have been some small, limited studies as well as anecdotal reports that certain alternative or “natural” treatments can help control blood glucose levels in people with diabetes or otherwise prevent the condition or prevent its complications.
