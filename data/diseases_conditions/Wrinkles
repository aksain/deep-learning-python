<p><b><a name="wrinkles_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="introduction_to_wrinkles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although wrinkles can signify wisdom, or at least some level of maturity, there is no question that newly born infants also have wrinkles. The real concern that most of us have is that certain types of wrinkling is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Aging</a> in our current "pop" culture is not viewed positively. Generally, the treatment of normal skin aging that does not result in a functional abnormality is termed "cosmetic." And most cosmetic procedures are not covered by health insurance.</p>.<p>Many products and procedures promise to reduce wrinkles. Some do little or nothing (like the products that claim they reduce "the appearance of fine lines," which means that they don't reduce the lines themselves). Others can achieve a fair amount of success.</p>.<p>Although all of our skin ages, sun exposure dramatically enhances the rate at which this occurs. Changes brought on by sun damage (photoaging) include dryness (really roughness), sagginess, skin growths like keratoses, lentigos ("<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/freckles/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver spots</a>"), and wrinkles. Just compare the facial skin of a poorly pigmented farmer to the skin of his buttocks.</p>.<p>Most wrinkles associated with aging appear on the parts of the body where sun exposure is greatest. These sites are the face, neck, the backs of the hands, and the tops of the forearms. Wrinkles come in two categories: fine surface lines and deep furrows that are related to muscular contraction. Some deep furrows are anatomical in nature and have little to do with aging. Generally, it is only the aging wrinkles that really bother people. There are two basic approaches to the amelioration of these signs of aging: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> and treatment. Topical wrinkle treatments are, in general, much more effective for fine lines. Deeper creases may require more invasive techniques, such injection of fillers, local muscle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">paralysis</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic_surgery_cosmetic_surgery/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic surgery</a>. There is a special form of wrinkling called "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulite/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cellulite</a>" that produces a "cottage cheese-like" appearance to the skin. This is most commonly noted in the hips and buttocks of women and is due to fat deposition in certain anatomical areas in the dermis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_factors_promote_wrinkles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Factors that promote wrinkling include the following:</p>.<p>Some of these factors are beyond our control. The main preventive measures we can take are to minimize sun exposure and not smoke. These measures can, at best, delay wrinkles.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">SPF</a> numbers on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sunscreen</a> labels refer to protection against UVB <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> (the "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sunburn_and_sun_poisoning/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sunburn</a> rays"). Higher SPF numbers (50) are better at protecting the skin than lower numbers. Broad-spectrum sunscreens offer protection against UVB and UVA radiation (longer-wave ultraviolet light). UVA rays are abundant in sunlight and are produced by tanning salon light bulbs; they may not cause immediate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/sunburn_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sunburn</a> but do produce aging and an increase <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">skin cancer</a> risk over time. (Sorry, but there is no such thing as a "safe tan.") Sunscreens that block UVA indicate this on the label and contain ingredients such as Parsol, Mexoryl, and benzophenones.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_treatments_and_procedures_are_available_for_wrinkles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several medical (topical medicines and creams) and many invasive techniques available for ameliorating wrinkles. They are all effective to the degree that (1) they change the nature of aging collagen, (2) they stretch the skin, (3) fill in the depressions in the skin, or (4) they paralyze muscles that cause the skin to crease. They include both medical and surgical methods:</p>.<p>Anyone considering any of the cosmetic procedures should be sure to consult doctors who have experience in one or several of these techniques. Patients should fully inform themselves about the risks and potential benefits of the procedure they are considering before going forward.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
