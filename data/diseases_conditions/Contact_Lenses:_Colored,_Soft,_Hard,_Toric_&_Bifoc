There are four types of colored contact lenses, each offering a slightly different benefit:</p>.<p>Remember, never share colored contacts lenses with anyone. Clean and care for them just as you would any prescription contact lens.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="soft_contact_lenses" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Soft contact lenses are made of a soft plastic and are more comfortable than hard contact lenses because they hold more water. Many soft contact lenses also provide UV protection. They are usually disposable and can be thrown away after a short period of use, generally every two to four weeks or daily, depending on the type of contact lens prescribed. Being able to have a fresh pair of soft contact lenses means less chance of infection, less cleaning, and more comfort, especially for people whose eyes naturally produce more protein that clouds contact lenses.</p>.<p>While most people choose soft contact lenses because of their benefits, there are also some disadvantages. Soft contact lenses easily absorb pollutants like lotion or soap from your hands, which can irritate your eyes. Soft contact lenses are also more fragile than hard contact lenses and can rip or tear easily.</p>.<p>The most recent type of soft contact lenses to hit the market include Daily Disposables and New Silicone Extended Wear Disposables.</p>.<p><b><a name="rigid_gas_permeable_hard_contact_lenses" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Rigid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gas</a> permeable lenses, or hard contact lenses, are more rigid than soft contact lenses and therefore more durable. Unlike older versions of hard contact lenses, rigid gas permeable lenses are made with silicone polymers, allowing oxygen to circulate to the cornea of the eye. Compared to soft contact lenses, hard contacts maintain their shape better and offer clearer vision for some types of corrections. They are also easy to take care of and are extremely durable.

There is no one best place to buy contact lenses from. Before you begin to shop around for contact lenses, make sure you ask your eye doctor for your contact lens prescription.
