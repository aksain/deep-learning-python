<p><b><a name="ingrown_hair_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_an_ingrown_hair" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An ingrown hair happens when the sharp tip of the hair curls back or grows sideways into the skin of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">hair follicle</a>. It is a benign condition, which usually appears as a small tan or sometimes pink bump under the skin. Often, a small pinpoint (often dark) part of the underlying hair may be seen under the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">skin bump</a>. In severe cases, multiple small red or pink little bumps at hair follicles may be seen on any skin area that normally grows hair.</p>.<p>An ingrown hair is a very common skin condition occurring primarily after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a>. Ingrown hairs tend to be more common in areas with coarse hairs, like the bikini area in women, and beard and neck in men. Individuals with thicker, tightly curled hairs, such as African Americans, tend to have the highest rate of problems with ingrown hairs, particularly of the beard area. Rarely, an ingrown hair may also appear in other skin parts, such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> or thighs. An ingrown hair is medically harmless, yet it may become cosmetically disfiguring and lead to scarring, skin discoloration (referred to as post-inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/phytophotodermatitis_hyperpigmentation_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">hyperpigmentation</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impetigo/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin infection</a>, and rarely <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/keloid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">keloid</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar</a> formation.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_an_ingrown_hair" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hair that is cut close to or below the follicular opening may have a sharp tip that can pierce the skin to cause an ingrown hair. Improper shaving techniques are the major cause of ingrown hairs. Other hair-removal methods, including waxing, as well as common friction from tight clothing, may worsen the situation. Although an ingrown hair is primarily caused by improper or aggressive hair removal, it sometimes occurs naturally as too much dead skin debris blocks the hair follicle opening, causing the hair to grow sideways.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_develops_ingrown_hairs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Nearly everyone will have an ingrown hair at some time. Overall, teenagers and adults are more prone to ingrown hairs. African-American individuals with thicker, coarser tightly curling hairs tend to have the highest rate of problems with ingrown hairs.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_an_ingrown_hair" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itch</a> and tenderness. An ingrown hair can lead to a localized foreign-body inflammatory reaction, which causes the pinpoint red or pink <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps on the skin</a>. Some of the bumps may be slightly red or have an accompanying light-red halo indicating inflammation. Sometimes, the curled hair can be barely visible at the center of the bump. Small pustules or dry red bumps are often scattered over an area that has been shaved recently. Often the bumps start a few days to weeks after hair removal and get worse as the hairs grow back. Pustules may be a sign of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/folliculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">folliculitis</a> due to the infection with common skin bacteria, such as <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Staphylococcus</a>.</i></p>.<p><b><a name="are_ingrown_hairs_the_same_as_razor_bumps_or_pseudofolliculitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>One type of ingrown hair is pseudofolliculitis, also called "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/razor_bumps_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">razor bumps</a>," in which small red bumps appear on the beard area (lower face and neck) and may flare with repeat shaving. Razor bumps are commonly experienced by African-American men, especially those who shave frequently. Flesh-colored red bumps with a hair shaft in their center are seen in shaved areas adjacent to the hair follicle opening. Pustules and abscesses may occasionally form, especially if there are bacteria on the skin. In chronic or inadequately treated situations, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, scarring, and rare <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/keloid_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">keloid</a> formation may occur.

Consulting a medical doctor who specializes in dermatology may be necessary for the optimal treatment of more severe cases.</p>.<p>Chemical depilatories like Neet or Nair can loosen the structure of hair, resulting in blunt tips of shaved hairs at the follicular opening. Chemical depilatories may be used every second or third day rather than every day to avoid chemical irritation on the skin. Hydrocortisone cream can be applied to alleviate the irritation caused by chemical depilatories.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tretinoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tretinoin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tretinoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Retin A</a>) cream can help decrease skin plugging or hyperkeratosis.

Topical antibiotics, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erythromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">erythromycin</a> (E-Mycin, Ilosone) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clindamycin-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">clindamycin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clindamycin-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cleocin</a>), topical antibacterial agents, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benzoyl_peroxide-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">benzoyl peroxide</a> (Persa-Gel), and the combinations of topical antibiotics and antibacterial agent, can help reduce the growth of skin bacteria and treat secondary infection.

Antibacterial washes, such as benzoyl peroxide (Clearasil, Proactiv) or chlorhexidine (Hibiclens), can be used once or twice a day to control the infection.
