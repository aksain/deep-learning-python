often used during surgery and other invasive procedures. Specifically, this 
reaction occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block 
the sensation of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, and with a muscle relaxant that is used to temporarily 
paralyze a person during a surgical procedure. If given these drugs, people at 
risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of 
muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, increased acid levels in the blood 
and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. Without prompt treatment, 
the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening. </p>.<p>People at increased risk for this disorder are said to have malignant 
hyperthermia susceptibility. Affected individuals may never know they have the 
condition unless they undergo testing or have a severe reaction to anesthesia 
during a surgical procedure. While this condition often occurs in people without 
other serious medical problems, certain inherited muscle diseases (including 
 central core disease and multiminicore disease) are associated with malignant 
hyperthermia susceptibility. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_malignant_hyperthermia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Malignant hyperthermia occurs in 1 in 5,000 to 50,000 instances in which 
people are given anesthetic gases. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is 
probably more frequent, because many people with an increased risk of this 
condition are never exposed to drugs that trigger a reaction. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_genes_are_related_to_malignant_hyperthermia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Variations of the <i>CACNA1S</i> and <i>RYR1</i> genes increase the risk of developing 
malignant hyperthermia. </p>.<p>Researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia 
susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. Mutations in 
the <i>RYR1</i> gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as MHS1. These 
mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. 
Another form of the condition, <i>MHS5</i>, results from mutations in the <i>CACNA1S</i> gene. 
These mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of 
malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. </p>.<p>The <i>RYR1</i> and <i>CACNA1S</i> genes provide instructions for making proteins that play 
essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to 
move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated 
way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms 
(ions) into muscle cells. The proteins produced from the <i>RYR1</i> and <i>CACNA1S</i> genes 
are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. In response to 
certain signals, the <i>CACNA1S</i> protein helps activate the RYR1 channel, which 
releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. The resulting increase in 
calcium ion <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concentration</a> inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to 
contract. </p>.<p>Mutations in the <i>RYR1</i> or <i>CACNA1S</i> gene cause the <i>RYR1</i> channel to open more 
easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. As a result, large 
amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. An 
overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract 
abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant 
hyperthermia. An increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also 
activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) 
and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis). </p>.<p>The genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (MHS2, 
MHS4, and MHS6) are still under study. A form of the condition known as MHS3 has 
been linked to the <i>CACNA2D1</i> gene. This gene provides instructions for making a 
protein that plays an essential role in activating the RYR1 channel to release 
calcium ions into muscle cells. Although this gene is thought to be related to 
malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been 
identified. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_inherit_malignant_hyperthermia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant 
pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to 
increase the risk of a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery. In 
most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who is 
also at risk for the condition. </p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_information_about_diagnosis_management_or_treatment_of_malignant_hyperthermia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These resources address the diagnosis or management of malignant hyperthermia
