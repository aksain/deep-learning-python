<p><b><a name="mental_illness_in_children_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_most_common_mental_illnesses_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mental disorders in children are quite common and sometimes severe. About 
one-fourth of children and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teens</a> experience some type of mental disorder in any 
given year, one-third at some time in their lives. The most common kind of 
mental disorders are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> disorders, like overanxious disorder of childhood 
or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/separation_anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">separation anxiety</a> disorder. Other common types of mental illnesses in childhood include 
behavior disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_children_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ADHD</a>), mood 
disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, and substance-use disorders like alcohol use 
disorders. Statistics indicate how relatively common these disorders occur. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ADHD</a> 
affects 8%-10% of school-aged children. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Depression</a> occurs at a rate of about 
2% during childhood and from 4%-7% during adolescence, affecting up to about 
20% of adolescents by the time they reach adulthood. In teens more frequently 
than in younger children, addictions, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bipolar disorder</a>, and less often early 
onset <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizophrenia</a> may manifest. </p>.<p>Although not as commonly occurring, developmental disabilities like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> 
spectrum disorders can have a significant lifelong impact on the life of the 
child and his or her family. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Autism spectrum disorder</a> is a developmental 
disorder that is characterized by impaired development in communication, social 
interaction, and behavior. Statistics about <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> include that it afflicts one 
out of every 88 children, a 78% increase in the past 10 years. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_mental_illness_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As is the case with most mental-health disorders at any age, such disorders 
in children do not have one single definitive cause. Rather, people with these 
illnesses tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental 
risk factors that contribute to their development. Biologically, mental 
illnesses tend to be associated with abnormal levels of neurotransmitters, like 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">serotonin</a> or dopamine in the brain, a decrease in the size of some areas of the 
brain, as well as increased activity in other areas of the brain. Girls are more 
likely to be diagnosed with mood disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and anxiety compared 
to boys, while disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_children_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> and 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_spectrum_disorder_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> spectrum disorders are more often assigned to boys. Gender differences in 
mental illness are thought to be the result of, among other things, a 
combination of biological differences based on gender, as well as the 
differences in how girls are encouraged to interpret their environment and 
respond to it compared to boys. There is thought to be at least a partially 
genetic contribution to the fact that children and adolescents with a mentally 
ill parent are up to four times more likely to develop such an illness 
themselves. Teens who develop a mental disorder are also more prone to having 
had other biological challenges, like low birth weight, trouble sleeping, and 
having a mother younger than 18 years old at the time of their birth. </p>.<p>Psychological risk factors for mental illness in children include low 
self-esteem, poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beauty_and_body_image/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">body image</a>, a tendency to be highly self-critical, and feeling 
helpless when dealing with negative events. Teen mental disorders are somewhat 
associated with the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> of body changes, including the fluctuating hormones 
of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">puberty</a>, as well as teen ambivalence toward increased independence, and with 
changes in their relationships with parents, peers, and others. Teenagers who 
suffer from conduct disorder, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD), 
clinical anxiety, or who have cognitive and learning problems, as well as 
trouble relating to others are at higher risk of also developing a mental 
disorder. </p>.<p>Childhood mental illness may be a reaction to environmental stresses, 
including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> like being the victim of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, the 
death of a loved one, school problems, or being the victim of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bullying/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bullying</a> or peer 
pressure. Gay teens are at higher risk for developing mental disorders like 
depression, thought to be because of the bullying by peers and potential 
rejection by family members. Children in military families have been found to be 
at risk for experiencing depression as well.
</p>.<p>The aforementioned environmental risk factors tend to specifically predispose 
individuals to childhood mental illness. Other risk factors tend to predispose 
people to developing a mental disorder at any age. Such nonspecific risk 
factors include a history of poverty, exposure to violence, having an antisocial 
peer group, or being socially isolated, abuse victimization, parental conflict, 
and family dissolution. Children who have low physical activity, poor academic 
performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for mental illness as 
well. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_mental_illness_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children with mental illness may experience the classic symptoms of their 
particular disorder but may exhibit other symptoms as well, including</p>.<p>Examples of risk-taking 
behaviors include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">running</a> into the street, climbing too high, engaging in 
physical altercations, or playing with unsafe items.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_mental_illness_in_children_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many health-care professionals may help make the diagnosis of a 
mental illness in children, including licensed mental-health therapists, 
pediatricians or other primary-care providers, emergency physicians, 
psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers. One of 
these professionals will likely conduct an extensive medical interview and 
physical examination or refer the child for those assessments as part of 
establishing the diagnosis.</p>.<p>Childhood mental illnesses may be associated with a 
number of other medical conditions or can be a side effect of various 
medications. For this reason, routine laboratory tests are often performed 
during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms. 
Occasionally, an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study may be needed. As part of 
this examination, the child and his or her parents may be asked a series of 
questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help further assess 
symptoms. The use of screening tools is particularly important for detecting 
early signs of mental illness in infants and toddlers, due to their being 
largely preverbal in their communication.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_mental_illness_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are a variety of treatments 
available for managing mental illnesses in children, including several effective 
medications, educational or occupational interventions, as well as specific 
forms of psychotherapy. In terms of medications, medications from specific drug 
classes are used to treat childhood mental illness. Examples include the 
stimulant class for treating ADHD, serotonergic medications for treating 
depression and anxiety, and neuroleptic medications for management of severe mood 
swings, anxiety, aggression, or in the treatment of childhood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizophrenia</a>.</p>.<p>For 
individuals who may be wondering how to manage the symptoms of a childhood 
mental illness using treatment without prescribed medications, psychotherapies 
are often used. While interventions like limiting exposure to food additives, 
preservatives, and processed sugars have been found to be helpful for some 
people with an illness like ADHD, the research evidence is still considered to 
be too limited for many physicians to recommend nutritional interventions. Also, 
placing such restrictions on the eating habits of a child or teenager can prove 
to be difficult at best, nearly impossible at worst.</p>.<p>Psychotherapy 
("talk therapy") is a form of mental-health counseling that involves working 
with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with 
childhood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">emotional disorders</a>. It can be a powerful intervention, even producing 
positive biochemical changes in the brain. Two major approaches are commonly 
used to treat childhood mental illness, interpersonal psychotherapy and 
cognitive behavioral therapy. In general, these 
therapies take weeks to months to complete. Each has a goal of alleviating 
symptoms. More intense psychotherapy may be needed for longer time periods when 
treating very severe mental illness.</p>.<p>The behavioral, educational/vocational, and 
psychotherapy components of treatment for childhood mental illnesses are usually 
at least as important as the medication treatment. Dealing with the specific 
challenges that mentally ill children present takes patience, understanding, and 
a balance of structure and flexibility. One kind of psychotherapy used to treat 
children with mental illness is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This form of 
therapy seeks to help those with many different kinds of psychiatric disorders 
identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce 
maladaptive behaviors. This therapy can be administered either individually or 
in group therapy. CBT that seeks to help the sufferer of many childhood mental 
illnesses may decrease the tendency of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depressed</a> or anxious child to pay 
excessive attention to potential threats, while helping the child with ADHD 
appropriately refocus their attention.</p>.<p>Behavioral techniques that are often used to decrease symptoms in children with 
behavioral disorders like ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct 
disorder or to help children with anxiety disorders like separation anxiety 
disorder or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> involve the parents, teacher, and other 
adult caretakers understanding the circumstances surrounding both positive and 
negative behaviors and how each kind of behavior is encouraged and discouraged. 
Specifically, learning when and where specific behaviors occur can go a long way 
toward understanding how to encourage the behavior to happen again if it's 
positive or extinguishing it if the behavior is negative. Being aware of how the 
reactions of others contribute to a behavior's continuing or not continuing tend 
to help the child with a behavior disorder shape their behaviors more 
positively. Also, developing a fair, meaningful, and effective repertoire of ways 
to encourage positive behaviors and provide consequences for negative behaviors 
is a key component of any behavior-management plan and therefore in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parenting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">parenting</a> 
children with behavioral disorders.</p>.<p>Often, a combination 
of medication and nonmedication interventions produces good results in helping 
the child with a mental illness. Depending on the illness, the length of time it 
existed before treatment starts, as well as the course of treatment deemed most 
appropriate, improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time, from 
two to three weeks to several months. Thus, appropriate treatment for mental 
illness can relieve symptoms or at least substantially reduce their severity and 
frequency, bringing significant relief to many children. There are also things 
that families of children with a mental illness can do to help make treatment 
more effective. Tips to better manage symptoms of most childhood mental-health 
problems include getting adequate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>, having a healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, and having the 
support and encouragement of parents and teachers.</p>.<p>If symptoms indicate that 
your child is suffering from mental illness, the health-care professional will 
likely strongly recommend treatment. Treatment may include addressing any 
medical conditions that cause or worsen the psychiatric symptoms. For example, 
an individual who is depressed and found to have low levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid hormone</a> 
might receive hormone replacement with levothyroxine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levothyroxine_sodium/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Synthroid</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/levothyroxine_sodium/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Levoxyl</a>). It 
may be found that a hyperactive, anxious, or psychotic child is having a reaction 
to a medication. Other components of treatment may be supportive therapy, such 
as changes in lifestyle and behavior, psychotherapy, and may include medication 
for moderate to severe mental illness. If symptoms are severe enough to warrant 
treatment with medication, symptoms tend to improve faster and for longer when 
medication treatment is combined with psychotherapy.</p>.<p>Interpersonal therapy 
(IPT): This helps to alleviate symptoms of mood disorders like anxiety and 
depression and helps the sufferer develop more effective skills for coping with 
relationships. IPT employs two strategies to achieve these goals:</p>.<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT): This has been found to be effective as part of treatment for childhood 
mental illness. This approach helps to alleviate 
depression, anxiety, and some behavioral problems and reduce the likelihood that 
symptoms will come back by helping the child change his or her way of thinking 
about or otherwise reacting to certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three 
techniques to accomplish these goals:</p>.<p>Most 
practitioners will continue treatment of a mental illness for at least six 
months. Treatment for children with a mental illness can have a significantly 
positive effect on the child's functioning with peers, family, and at school. 
Without treatment, symptoms tend to last much longer and may never get better. 
In fact, they may get worse. With treatment, chances of recovery are much 
improved. </p>.<p>The major type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antidepressant</a> and anti-anxiety 
medication prescribed for children is the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI medications affect levels of serotonin in the brain. 
For many prescribing doctors, these medications are the first choice because of 
the high level of effectiveness and general safety of this group of medicines. 
Examples of medications in this class that are approved for use in children are 
listed here. The generic name is first, with the brand name in parentheses.</p>.<p>The medications available for attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can have slightly different effects from 
individual to individual, and currently no way exists to tell which will work 
best. Medications indicated for ADHD are thought to work by improving the 
imbalance of neurochemicals that are thought to contribute to ADHD. Some 
commonly prescribed medications include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bipolar disorder</a> with 
medications tends to address two aspects: relieving already existing symptoms of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mania</a> or depression and preventing symptoms from returning. Medications that are 
thought to be particularly effective in treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">manic</a> and mixed symptoms and

autism spectrum disorder, Risperdal has been FDA approved in children 5 years 
of age and older, while Abilify has been approved in children 6 years of age and 
older. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_mental_illness_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children and youth with 
mental-health problems are at risk for having lower educational achievement, 
greater involvement with the criminal justice system, and fewer stable and 
longer-term placements in the child welfare system than their peers. Children 
and youth with mental-health problems are more likely to experience problems at 
school, be absent, or be suspended or expelled than are children with other 
disabilities. Youth in high school with mental-health problems are more likely 
to fail or drop out of school. When treated, children and youth with mental-health 
problems fare better at home, in schools, and in their communities.</p>.<p>Children with more anxiety disorders 
are at higher risk for anxiety, depression, and substance-abuse disorders in 
adulthood. They tend to achieve less academically and are more likely to engage 
in early parenthood and suicidal behaviors.</p>.<p>Depression can be quite chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode 
of the illness will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. A bit 
over 50% of teens who are part of research studies on the treatment of 
depression improve significantly. Over 8% of adolescents suffer from depression 
that lasts a year or more. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the 
United States in people over 5 years of age. This illness is a leading cause of 
health impairment (morbidity) and death (mortality). Certainly the worst 
potential outcome of depression, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">suicide</a> is the third leading cause of death in 
teens. </p>.<p>About half of children who are diagnosed as having attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are thought to continue to have significant 
symptoms of the disorder into adulthood. Of those individuals, about half tend 
to exhibit less overt hyperactivity than they did as children. People with this 
disorder are at higher risk for lower educational achievement as children, job 
and relationship loss, as well as experiencing more automobile accidents and 
drug use as teens and adults, particularly if left untreated.</p>.<p>While the prognosis for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_mania_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bipolar disorder</a> indicates that individuals with 
this disorder can expect to experience episodes of some sort of mood problem up 
to 60% of the time, those episodes can be well managed by comprehensive 
treatment. There are a number of potential complications of bipolar disorder, 
particularly if left untreated. This illness may be compounded by other mental-health problems, 
including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">substance abuse</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">addiction</a>. The risk of committing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">suicide</a> is 60 
times higher for people with bipolar disorder compared to the general 
population. Bipolar disorder is the fifth leading cause of disability and the 
ninth leading cause of years lost to death or disability worldwide.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_mental_illness_in_children_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Attempts at prevention of childhood mental illness tends to address both 
specific and nonspecific risk factors, strengthen protective factors, and use an 
approach that is appropriate for the child's age and developmental level. Such 
programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well 
as family based prevention strategies because research shows that these 
interventions tend to be the most helpful. </p>.<p>The inverse of most risk factors, protective factors for childhood mental 
illness include having the involvement of supportive adults, strong family and 
peer relationships, healthy coping skills, and emotional regulation. Children and 
adolescents of a mentally ill parent tend to be more resilient when the child is 
more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their 
relationships, as well as being able to understand their parents' illness. For 
mentally ill parents, their children seem to be more protected from developing a 
psychiatric illness when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to 
parenting and to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_relationships/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">healthy relationships</a>. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_research_is_being_done_on_mental_illness_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Due to the historical lack of understanding of this topic, research on mental 
illness in children is occurring on a number of fronts. In an effort to better 
understand how often childhood mental illnesses occur, a great deal of research 
is focused on achieving that goal. Understanding more about the protective 
factors against mental illness is being explored. Ways to improve the access that children have to treatment is another
