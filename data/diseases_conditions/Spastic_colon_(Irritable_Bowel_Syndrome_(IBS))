It is believed to be due to a number of factors, including alteration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility, abnormal nervous system signals, increased sensitivity to pain, and food intolerances. The following are risk factors thought to cause IBS:</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_test_for_irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Irritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed by excluding other GI disorders that can cause similar symptoms. A complete history and physical is taken to determine the duration and frequency of symptoms. To be diagnosed with the condition, the duration of symptoms should be at least six months and should occur at least three times a month.</p>.<p>A doctor may order tests, including blood tests, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a> tests, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scans</a>. There is no specific finding on these tests that can confirm the diagnosis of IBS, however, other problems can be ruled out by performing them.</p>.<p>Two relatively new blood tests may help diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. One test is for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibs_pictures_slideshow_understanding_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">IBS-D</a>), and the other is for irritable bowel syndrome with both diarrhea and constipation (irritable bowel syndrome mixed IBS-M). Neither test is able to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).</p>.<p>Both blood tests are for anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies. It is thought that these antibodies develop in some patients after an acute bout of gastroenteritis that is caused by several different, common types of bacteria. The overgrowth of these bacteria in the gut may trigger an immune attack on the patientsâ€™ own intestinal tissues (autoimmunity) with the ensuing inflammation and damage to the tissues causing the symptoms of IBS.</p>.<p>The tests may help distinguish between irritable bowel syndrome and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibs_vs_ibd_differences_and_similarities/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inflammatory bowel disease</a> or IBD, a different type of intestinal inflammatory disease that includes Crohn's disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>.<p>The antibody tests seems to be useful in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea IBS-D, but not IBS with constipation (IBS-C). The tests also appear to be specific, and if the antibodies are present, it is highly likely that IBS is present. However, the tests are insensitive, meaning if the antibodies are not present, the patient still may have IBS. Thus, these irritable bowel syndrome tests may be identifying only a subset of patients with IBS, those with post-infectious IBS. Both IBS blood tests have not undergone rigorous testing, and have not yet been approved by the FDA. It is expected to be an expensive test costing $500 to over $1,000.</p>.<p>A doctor also may send the patient to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the digestive system). Depending on the symptoms, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">upper endoscopy</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">colonoscopy</a> may be performed.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized mostly by abdominal pain and cramping.
