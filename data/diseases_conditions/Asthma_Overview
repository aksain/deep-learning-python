There is a newly described syndrome called asthma/COPD overlap syndrome that displays characteristics of both asthma and COPD. This is an area of medicine that needs further study.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_and_causes_of_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Asthma results from complex interactions between an individual's inherited genetic makeup and their interactions with the environment. The factors that cause a genetically predisposed individual to become <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">asthmatic</a> are poorly understood. The following are risk factors for asthma:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The many potential triggers of asthma largely explain the different ways in which asthma can present. In most cases, the disease starts in early childhood from 2-6 years of age. In this age group, the cause of asthma is often linked to exposure to allergens, such as dust mites, tobacco smoke, and viral respiratory infections. In very young children, less than 2 years of age, asthma can be difficult to diagnose with certainty. Wheezing at this age often follows a viral infection and might disappear later, without ever leading to asthma. Asthma, however, can develop again in adulthood. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adult-onset_asthma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Adult-onset asthma</a> occurs more often in women, mostly middle-aged, and frequently follows a respiratory tract infection. The triggers in this group are usually nonallergic in nature.</p>.<p>Your doctor may refer to asthma as being "extrinsic" or "intrinsic." A better understanding of the nature of asthma can help explain the differences between them. Extrinsic, or allergic asthma, is more common and typically develops in childhood. Approximately 70%-80% of children with asthma also have documented <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergies</a>. Typically, there is a family history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergies</a>. Additionally, other allergic conditions, such as nasal allergies or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_atopic_dermatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eczema</a>, are often also present. Allergic asthma often goes into remission in early adulthood. However, in many cases, the asthma reappears later.</p>.<p>Intrinsic asthma represents a small amount of all cases. It usually develops after the age of 30 and is not typically associated with allergies. Women are more frequently affected and many cases seem to follow a respiratory tract infection. Obesity also appears to be a risk factor for this type of asthma. Intrinsic asthma can be difficult to treat and symptoms are often chronic and year-round.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_asthma_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The classic signs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of asthma</a> are shortness of breath, cough (often worse at night), and wheezing (high-pitched whistling sound produced by turbulent airflow through narrow airways, typically with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">exhalation</a>). Many patients also report chest tightness. It is important to note that these symptoms are episodic, and individuals with asthma can go long periods of time without any symptoms.</p>.<p>Common triggers for asthmatic symptoms include exposure to allergens (pets, dust mites, cockroach, molds, and pollens), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>, and viral infections. Tobacco use or exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/secondhand_smoke/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">secondhand smoke</a> complicates asthma management.</p>.<p>Many of the symptoms and signs of asthma are nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions as well. Symptoms that might suggest conditions other than asthma include new symptom onset in older age, the presence of associated symptoms (such as chest discomfort, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lightheadedness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/palpitations_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">palpitations</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>), and lack of response to appropriate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_medications/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">medications for asthma</a>.</p>.<p>The physical exam in asthma is often completely normal. Occasionally, wheezing is present. In an asthma exacerbation, the respiratory rate increases, the heart rate increases, and the work of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">respiration</a> increases. Individuals often require accessory muscles to breathe, and breath sounds can be diminished. It is important to note that the blood oxygen level typically remains fairly normal even in the midst of a significant asthma exacerbation. Low blood oxygen level is therefore concerning for impending respiratory failure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_asthma_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of asthma begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Primary-care providers are familiar with the diagnosis of asthma, but specialists such as allergists or pulmonologists may be involved. A typical history is an individual with a family history of allergic conditions or a personal history of allergic rhinitis who experiences <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a>, wheezing, and difficulty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a>, especially with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> or during the night. There may also be a propensity toward <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_acute/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bronchitis</a> or respiratory infections. In addition to a typical history, improvement with a trial of appropriate medications is very suggestive of asthma.</p>.<p>In addition to the history and exam, the following are diagnostic procedures that can be used to help with the diagnosis of asthma:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_asthma_treatment_options_are_there_home_remedies_for_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As per widely used guidelines, the treatment goals for asthma are to:</p>.<p>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the chronic treatment of asthma and are first-line therapy per most asthma guidelines. It is well recognized that ICS are very effective in decreasing the risk of asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the combination of a long-acting bronchodilator (LABA) and an ICS has a significant additional beneficial effect on improving asthma control.</p>.<p>The most commonly used <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_medications/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma medications</a> include the following:</p>.<p>There is often concern about potential long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that even long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has very few if any sustained, clinically significant side effects, including changes in bone health, growth, or weight. However, the goal always remains to treat all individuals with the least amount of medication that is effective. Patients with asthma should be routinely reassessed for any appropriate changes to their medical regimen.</p>.<p>Asthma medications can be administered via inhalers either with or without a spacer or nebulized solution. It is important to note that if an individual has proper technique with an inhaler, the amount of medication deposited in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> is no different than that when using a nebulized solution. When prescribing asthma medications, it is essential to provide the appropriate teaching on proper delivery technique.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Smoking cessation</a> and/or minimizing exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/secondhand_smoke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">secondhand smoke</a> are critical when treating asthma. Treating concurrent conditions such as allergic rhinitis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">GERD</a>) may also improve asthma control. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Vaccinations</a> such as the annual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">influenza</a> vaccination and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> vaccination are also indicated.</p>.<p>Although the vast majority of individuals with asthma are treated as outpatients, treatment of severe exacerbations can require management in the emergency department or inpatient hospitalization. These individuals typically require use of supplemental oxygen, early administration of systemic steroids, and frequent or even continuous administration of bronchodilators via a nebulized solution. Individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes are referred to a specialist (pulmonologist or allergist). The following factors should prompt consideration or referral:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_someone_do_when_experiencing_an_asthma_attack" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients experiencing acute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">asthma symptoms</a> should first use their rescue inhaler (albuterol). If asthma symptoms are worsening and use of albuterol is increasing, then asthma patients should have a medical evaluation. A course of oral steroids may be indicated and an adjustment in asthma maintenance therapy may be needed. If symptoms are rapidly progressive, asthma patients should seek emergency medical care.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_an_asthma_action_plan" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patient education is a critical component in the successful management of asthma. An asthma action plan provides an individual with specific directions for daily asthma management and for adjusting medications in response to increasing symptoms or decreasing lung function, as usually measured by a peak flow meter.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for asthma is generally favorable. Children experience complete remission more often than adults. Although adults with asthma experience a greater rate of loss in their lung function as compared to age-controlled counterparts, this decline is usually not as severe as seen in other conditions, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> (COPD) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/emphysema_lung_condition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emphysema</a>. Asthma in the absence of other comorbidities does not appear to shorten life expectancy. Risk factors for poor prognosis from asthma include</p>.<p>The airway narrowing in asthma may become fixed over time and can resemble COPD or emphysema. The other main complication of asthma is due to side effects from oral steroid use, which can include bone loss (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoporosis</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weight gain</a>, and glucose intolerance.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_asthma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>With the increasing prevalence of asthma, numerous studies have looked for risk factors and ways to potentially prevent asthma. It has been shown that individuals living on farms are protected against wheezing, asthma, and even environmental allergies. The role of air pollution has been questioned in both the increased incidence of asthma and in regards to asthma exacerbations.</p>.<p>Climate change is also being studied as a factor in the increased incidence of asthma. Maternal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_during_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking during pregnancy</a> is a risk factor for asthma and poor outcomes. Tobacco smoke is also a significant risk factor for the development and progression of asthma. Treatment of environmental allergies with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergen</a> immunotherapy, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> shots, has been shown to decrease a child's risk of developing asthma. The development of asthma is ultimately a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic factors, and currently there is no proven way to decrease an individual's risk of developing asthma.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
