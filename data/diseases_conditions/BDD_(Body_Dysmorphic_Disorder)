A person with BDD tends to have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_surgery_before_after_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cosmetic surgery</a>, and even if the surgery is successful, does not think it was and is unhappy with the outcome.</p>.<p><b><a name="symptoms_of_bdd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Getting cosmetic surgery can make BDD worse. They are often not happy with the outcome of the surgery. If they are, they may start to focus attention on another body area and become preoccupied trying to fix the new "defect." In this case, some patients with BDD become angry at the surgeon for making their appearance worse and may even become violent towards the surgeon.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_for_bdd" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>
