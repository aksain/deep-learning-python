<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=41529" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="bio">Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD</a></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the GI tract works. Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged. IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together. The most common symptoms of IBS are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abdominal pain</a> or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation_myths_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">constipation</a>, or both. In the past, IBS was called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">colitis</a>, mucous colitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">spastic colon</a>, nervous colon, and spastic bowel. The name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a person's imagination.</p>.<p>IBS is diagnosed when a child who is growing as expected has <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">abdominal pain</a> or discomfort once per week for at least 2 months without other disease or injury that could explain the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> or discomfort of IBS may occur with a change in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a> frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_gi_tract" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a> of food. Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a>, stomach, small intestine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">large intestine</a> - which includes the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">appendix</a>, cecum, colon, and - rectum - and anus. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> are sometimes called the bowel. The last part of the GI tract - called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barium_enema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">lower GI</a> tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.</p>.<p>The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool. Stool passes from the colon to the rectum. The rectum is located between the last part of the colon - called the sigmoid colon - and the anus. The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement. During a bowel movement, stool moves from the rectum to the anus, the opening through which stool leaves the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_ibs_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Limited information is available about the number of children with IBS. Older studies have reported prevalence rates for recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abdominal pain in children</a> of 10 to 20 percent.¹ However, these studies did not differentiate IBS from functional abdominal pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a>, and abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">migraine</a>. One study of children in North America found that 14 percent of high school students and 6 percent of middle school students have IBS. The study also found that IBS affects boys and girls equally.²<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_ibs_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain or discomfort and changes in bowel habits. To meet the definition of IBS, the pain or discomfort should be associated with two of the following three symptoms:</p>.<p>Other symptoms of IBS may include:</p>.<p>Symptoms may often occur after eating a meal. To meet the definition of IBS, symptoms must occur at least once per week for at least 2 months.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_ibs_in_children" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The causes of IBS are not well understood. Researchers believe a combination of physical and mental health problems can lead to IBS. The possible causes of IBS in children include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_ibs_in_children_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the child's symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the child's symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:</p>.<p>Further testing is not usually needed, though the health care provider may do a blood test to screen for other problems. Additional diagnostic tests may be needed based on the results of the screening blood test and for children who also have signs such as:</p>.<p>Further diagnostic tests may also be needed for children with a family history of:</p>.<p>Additional diagnostic tests may include a stool test, ultrasound, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.</p>.<p><b>Stool tests.</b> A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child's caretaker a container for catching and storing the child's stool. The sample is returned to the health care provider or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam, to check for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_the_stool_rectal_bleeding/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood in the stool</a>. Stool tests can show the presence of parasites or blood.</p>.<p><b>Ultrasound.</b> Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider's office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist - a doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show problems in the GI tract causing pain or other symptoms.</p>.<p><b>Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. </b>The tests are similar, but a colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while a flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist - a doctor who specializes in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tummy_trouble_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">digestive diseases</a>. For both tests, a health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The child may be asked to follow a clear <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liquid_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">liquid diet</a> for 1 to 3 days before either test. The night before the test, the child may need to take a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lactulose-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">laxative</a>. One or more enemas may also be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.</p>.<p>In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show signs of problems in the lower GI tract.</p>.<p>The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of intestinal lining for examination with a microscope. The child will not feel the biopsy. A pathologist - a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases - examines the tissue in a lab.</p>.<p>Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Full recovery is expected by the next day.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_ibs_in_children_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Though there is no cure for IBS, the symptoms can be treated with a combination of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="eating_diet_and_nutrition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help IBS symptoms. Eating meals that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables may help.</p>.<p>Certain foods and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">drinks</a> may cause IBS symptoms in some children, such as:</p>.<p>Children with IBS may want to limit or avoid these foods. Keeping a food diary is a good way to track which foods cause symptoms so they can be excluded from or reduced in the diet.</p>.<p>Dietary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">fiber</a> may lessen constipation in children with IBS, but it may not help with lowering pain. Fiber helps keep stool soft so it moves smoothly through the colon. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends children consume "age plus 5" grams of fiber daily. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get "7 plus 5," or 12 grams, of fiber a day.³ Fiber may cause gas and trigger symptoms in some children with IBS. Increasing fiber intake by 2 to 3 grams per day may help reduce the risk of increased gas and bloating.</p>.<p><b><a name="medications" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The health care provider will select medications based on the child's symptoms. Caregivers should not give children any medications unless told to do so by a health care provider.</p>.<p><b><a name="probiotics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Probiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/probiotics/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">probiotic</a> combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. But more research is needed. Probiotics can be found in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dietary supplements</a>, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt. A health care provider can give information about the right kind and right amount of probiotics to take to improve IBS symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="therapies_for_mental_health_problems" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following therapies can help improve IBS symptoms due to mental health problems:</p>
