Approximately 6 million people become infected with HPV every year in the US, and approximately 50% of those infected are between the ages of 15 and 25.</p>.<p>HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the development of warts, cancers, or even symptoms. In fact, the majority of people infected with HPV have no symptoms or lesions at all. Determination of whether or not a person is infected with HPV involves tests that identify the genetic material (DNA) of the virus. Moreover, it has not been definitely established whether the body's immune system is able to permanently clear the body of an HPV infection. Many people will test positive for HPV infection, and then have negative HPV tests for months to years, only to have a positive test result later. Currently, it is unclear if this is due to a latent (continuing but hidden) viral infection or if the person has become re-infected with the virus.</p>.<p>Asymptomatic people infected with HPVs (those without HPV-induced warts or lesions) are still able to spread the infections to others through sexual contact.</p>.<p>It is important to note that in the U.S. and other developed countries, screening and early treatment of precancerous changes of the cervix have dramatically reduced the incidence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cervical cancer</a>. In developing countries lacking the medical infrastructure or financial means to implement a screening program, the incidence of cervical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> resulting from HPV infection is much higher. In fact, cervical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> develops in around 500,000 women each year worldwide, and, in many countries, it is the most common cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a> deaths.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_genital_warts_in_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women who have genital warts inside the vagina may experience symptoms such as bleeding following sexual intercourse or an abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vaginal discharge</a>. Rarely, bleeding or urinary obstruction may occur if the wart involves the urethral opening.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_genital_warts_look_like_pictures_in_women_and_men" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_get_genital_warts_hpv_infection_causes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_vaccine_to_prevent_genital_warts_and_hpv_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> is available against common HPV types associated with the development of genital warts and cervical and anogenital carcinomas. This vaccine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gardasil_vaccine_hpv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Gardasil</a> 9) has received FDA approval for use in females between 9 and 26 years of age and in males aged 9 to 15. It confers immunity against 9 HPV types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. An earlier version of this vaccine (Gardasil) is directed at four common HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18). Another vaccine directed at HPV types 16 and 18, known as Cervarix, was approved for use in females aged 10 to 15, but was withdrawn from the market in 2016 due to low demand.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_treatment_or_cure_for_genital_warts_hpv_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No treatment will cure genital warts or HPV infection. The only treatment is to remove the lesions caused by the virus. Unfortunately, even removal of the warts does not necessarily prevent the spread of the virus, and genital warts frequently recur. None of the available treatment options is ideal or clearly superior to others.<br>Available treatments for genital warts lesions, signs, and symptoms include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_if_a_woman_has_precancerous_changes_dysplasia_of_the_cervix" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Women who have evidence of moderate or severe precancerous changes in the uterine cervix require treatment to ensure that these cells do not progress to cancer. In this case, treatment usually involves surgical removal or destruction of the involved tissue.</p>.<p><b><a name="will_birth_control_protect_against_genital_warts_or_hpv_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_to_do_if_you_have_been_exposed_to_someone_with_genital_warts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Both people with HPV infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading HPV and the appearance of the lesions. They should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/condoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">condoms</a> are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. It is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity.</p>.<p>Finally, female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix, as precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer. Similarly, men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers, although it is not yet been determined how to optimally screen for or manage early <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anal_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anal cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_test_to_diagnose_genital_warts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>HPV sometimes can be suspected by changes that appear on a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pap_smear/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Pap smear</a>, since pap smears identify infected abnormal cells that may be precursors to cancer. HPV infection can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix that are recognized on a Pap smear. If a woman has an abnormal Pap smear, more advanced tests may be performed. HPV also can be seen on biopsy (for example, from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">genital wart</a> or from the uterine cervix).</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_dna_test_for_types_of_hpv_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In 2009, the U.S. FDA approved the first DNA tests for diagnosis of the common cancer-causing HPV types in cervical samples. Two tests known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR, are used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with cancer. These are HPV types 16 and 18, as well as other "high risk" or cancer-associated HPV types. These tests do not replace standard Pap testing or clinical examination, and they are used in combination with traditional screening methods to help estimate a woman's risk and aid in management decisions.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
