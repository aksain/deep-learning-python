<p><b><a name="peyronies_disease_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Peyronie's disease (also termed Peyronie disease) is the development of scar 
tissue inside the penis that causes the penis to develop abnormal curvature 
(contracture) in the scarred area. The disease may occur in about 1% to 8% of men, 
most frequently in men aged about 40 to 70 years old. The disease also may occur 
more frequently with men that develop:</p>.<p>It occasionally can occur 
in younger men.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact cause of Peyronie's disease is not known. However, whatever can cause plaque or scar formation in the penile shaft is a likely causal candidate. Researchers have suggested several possible agents such as vitamin E deficiency, beta-blocking medications, elevations in serotonin, and genetic causes. Some researchers think that minor vascular traumas to the penis (during sex, athletic or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> endeavors) that occur repeatedly over time may lead to scar formation. None of these possible agents or processes is proven to be the cause to date.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of Peyronie's disease usually are a combination of one or more 
symptoms as follows:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_phases_of_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are, in general, two phases of Peyronie's disease. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_peyronies_disease_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The patient's history of pain with erections and/or sex and the physical 
examination of the penis that shows abnormal angulation of the penile shaft or 
the presence of plaque or scarring felt or palpated in the penis is usually the 
basis for diagnosis. Urologists are specialists that usually diagnose and treat 
this disease. There are no definitive blood tests for this disease, although a 
human cell antigen, HLA-B7 has been associated with the disease. In general no 
additional tests are necessary, but 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ultrasound</a> techniques, when accompanied by 
an injection of drug into the penis (intercavernous injection) can help show the 
doctor where and how extensive is the scarring, and aid the doctor in 
determining treatments. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no treatment that will cure Peyronie's disease. However, there are 
several types of treatments that are designed to reduce the symptoms of the 
disease. </p>.<p><b><a name="medications_vitamins_and_supplements" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In December, 2013, the FDA approved <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/collagenase_clostridium_histolyticum/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">collagenase clostridium histolyticum</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/collagenase_clostridium_histolyticum/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Xiaflex</a>) to treat individuals with Peyronie's disease. Each treatment cycle consists of two Xiaflex injections into the plaque in the penis to break up the collagen that causes the curvature deformity. Treatments consist of a maximum four injections.</p>.<p>Oral therapy with vitamin E, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colchicine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">colchicine</a>, PABA, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tamoxifen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tamoxifen</a>, and other medications have been tried with limited success in some patients. Usually those in the acute phase of the disease responded best.</p>.<p>In the early stages of the disease, erectile dysfunction (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ED</a>) may be treated with such drugs as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sildenafil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sildenafil</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sildenafil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Viagra</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vardenafil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vardenafil</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vardenafil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Levitra</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tadalafil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tadalafil</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tadalafil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cialis</a>, Adcirca).</p>.<p>Injection therapy using combinations of drugs mentioned above and adding prostaglandin E1 or other drugs such as betamethasone alone or with hyaluronidase; PABA has been reported to reduce the penile plaque size.</p>.<p>Other drugs have also been used with varying degree of success. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/verapamil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Verapamil</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/verapamil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Calan</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/verapamil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Verelan</a>, Verelan PM, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/verapamil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Isoptin</a>, Isoptin SR, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/verapamil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Covera-HS</a> [a medication usually used for high blood pressure treatment]) appears to disrupt the production of a protein involved in the formation of Peyronie's disease leisons.</p>.<p>Another method is iontophoresis (also termed electromotive administration or EMDA) where verapamil and other drugs are applied to the penile skin and pushed through the skin with a low electrical current.</p>.<p><b><a name="shockwave_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Shockwave therapy (done with a lithotripter device like those used to 
break up <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney stones</a>) has been used on plaque or scaring that is calcified. 
Other mechanical devices, including vacuum-based machines and low-dose 
radiotherapy have been tried. Although some successes are seen with these 
methods, best results are in acute phase patients. There are ongoing studies 
with different drugs (for example, interferons, and collagenase) and surgical techniques.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgical therapy is done on some patients. These surgical patients usually have to meet criteria that may vary from surgeon to surgeon. In general, surgical therapy is done when other methods have failed or the patient is in the chronic stage of the disease and erectile dysfunction is part of the patient's symptoms. Surgical therapy may involve incision or cutting the scarred tissue, scar tissue removal, scar tissue removal with auto-grafting or artificial graft material. In addition, implanted devices (penile implant) that allow the patient to sustain an erection are also utilized in some individuals.</p>.<p><b><a name="other_therapies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some individuals suggest stretching and/or milking the penis are exercises that can help reduce the penile curvature that occurs in the disease. Patients should discuss these techniques with their doctor (Urologist) before using these methods.
