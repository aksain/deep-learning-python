<p><b><a name="psoriasis_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psoriasis is a noncontagious, chronic skin disease that produces plaques of thickened, scaly skin. The dry flakes of silvery-white skin scales result from the excessively rapid proliferation of skin cells. Psoriasis is fundamentally an immune system problem. The proliferation of skin cells is triggered by inflammatory chemicals produced by specialized white blood cells called T-cells. Psoriasis commonly affects the skin of the elbows, knees, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">scalp</a>.</p>.<p>The spectrum of this autoimmune disease ranges from mild with limited involvement of small areas of skin to severe psoriasis with large, thick plaques to red inflamed skin affecting the entire body surface.</p>.<p>Psoriasis is considered an incurable, long-term (chronic) inflammatory skin condition. It has a variable course, periodically improving and worsening. It is not unusual for psoriasis to spontaneously clear for years and stay in remission. Many people note a worsening of their symptoms in the colder winter months.</p>.<p>Psoriasis, an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, affects all races and both sexes. Although psoriasis can be seen in people of any age, from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a> to seniors, most commonly patients are first diagnosed in their early adult years. The self-esteem and quality of life of patients with psoriasis is often diminished because of the appearance of their skin. Recently, it has become clear that people with psoriasis are more likely to have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a>, high blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipids</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardiovascular disease</a>, and a variety of other inflammatory diseases. This may reflect an inability to control inflammation. Caring for psoriasis takes medical teamwork.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_psoriasis_causes_and_risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact cause remains unknown. A combination of elements, including genetic predisposition and environmental factors, are involved. It is common for psoriasis to be found in members of the same family. Defects in the immune system and the control of inflammation are thought to play major roles. Certain medications like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta-blockers</a> have been linked to psoriasis. Despite research over the past 30 years, the "master switch" that turns on psoriasis is still a mystery.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several different forms of psoriasis, including plaque psoriasis or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/psoriasis_vulgaris_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">psoriasis vulgaris</a> (common type), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/guttate_psoriasis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">guttate psoriasis</a> (small, drop-like spots), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/inverse_psoriasis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">inverse psoriasis</a> (in the folds like of the underarms, navel, groin, and buttocks), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pustular_psoriasis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pustular psoriasis</a> (small pus-filled yellowish <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blisters</a>). When the palms and the soles are involved, this is known as palmoplantar psoriasis. In <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/erythrodermic_psoriasis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">erythrodermic psoriasis</a>, the entire skin surface is involved with the disease.

Usually, the nail signs accompany the skin and arthritis symptoms and signs. Nail psoriasis is typically very difficult to treat. Treatment options are somewhat limited and include potent topical steroids applied at the nail-base cuticle, injection of steroids at the nail-base cuticle, and oral or systemic medications as described below for the treatment of psoriasis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_psoriasis_symptoms_and_signs_what_does_psoriasis_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Plaque psoriasis signs and symptoms appear as red or pink small scaly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a> that merge into plaques of raised skin.

This is when a biopsy can be quite valuable to distinguish between the two conditions. Of note, both eczematous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dermatitis</a> and psoriasis often respond to similar treatments. Certain types of eczematous dermatitis can be cured where this is not the case for psoriasis.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_many_people_have_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Psoriasis is a fairly common skin condition and is estimated to affect approximately 1%-3% of the U.S. population. It currently affects roughly 7.5 million to 8.5 million people in the U.S. It is seen worldwide in about 125 million people. Interestingly, African Americans have about half the rate of psoriasis as Caucasians.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_psoriasis_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No. A person cannot catch it from someone else, and one cannot pass it to anyone else by skin-to-skin contact. Directly touching someone with psoriasis every day will never transmit the condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_cure_for_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No, psoriasis is not currently curable. However, it can go into remission, producing an entirely normal skin surface. Ongoing research is actively making progress on finding better treatments and a possible cure in the future.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_psoriasis_hereditary" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although psoriasis is not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> from person to person, there is a known hereditary tendency. Therefore, family history is very helpful in making the diagnosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_health_care_specialists_treat_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatology/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatologists</a> specialize in the treatment of joint disorders and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriatic_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriatic arthritis</a>. Many kinds of doctors may treat psoriasis, including dermatologists, family physicians, internal medicine physicians, rheumatologists, and other medical doctors. Some patients have also seen other allied health professionals such as acupuncturists, holistic practitioners, chiropractors, and nutritionists.</p>.<p>The American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation are excellent sources to help find doctors who specialize in this disease. Not all dermatologists and rheumatologists treat psoriasis. The National Psoriasis Foundation has one of the most up-to-date databases of current psoriasis specialists.</p>.<p>It is now apparent that patients with psoriasis are prone to a variety of other disease conditions, so-called comorbidities. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypertension</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_intestinal_problems/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inflammatory bowel disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_hyperlipidemia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">hyperlipidemia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> problems, and arthritis are more common in patients with psoriasis. It is very important for all patients with psoriasis to be carefully monitored by their primary care providers for these associated illnesses. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">joint inflammation</a> of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriatic_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">psoriatic arthritis</a> and its complications are frequently managed by rheumatologists.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_psoriasis_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are many effective psoriasis treatment choices. The best treatment is individually determined by the treating doctor and depends, in part, on the type of disease, the severity, and amount of skin involved and the type of insurance coverage.</p>.<p>For mild disease that involves only small areas of the body (less than 10% of the total skin surface), topical treatments (skin applied), such as creams, lotions, and sprays, may be very effective and safe to use. Occasionally, a small local injection of steroids directly into a tough or resistant isolated psoriatic plaque may be helpful.</p>.<p>For moderate to severe psoriasis that involves much larger areas of the body (&gt;10% or more of the total skin surface), topical products may not be effective or practical to apply. This may require ultraviolet light treatments or systemic (total body treatments such as pills or injections) medicines. Internal medications usually have greater risks. Because topical therapy has no effect on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/psoriatic_arthritis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">psoriatic arthritis</a>, systemic medications are generally required to stop the progression to permanent joint destruction.</p>.<p>It is important to keep in mind that as with any medical condition, all medicines carry possible side effects. No medication is 100% effective for everyone, and no medication is 100% safe. The decision to use any medication requires thorough consideration and discussion with your health care provider. The risks and potential benefit of medications have to be considered for each type of psoriasis and the individual. Of two patients with precisely the same amount of disease, one may tolerate it with very little treatment, while the other may become incapacitated and require treatment internally.</p>.<p>A proposal to minimize the toxicity of some of these medicines has been commonly called "rotational" therapy. The idea is to change the anti-psoriasis <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> every six to 24 months in order to minimize the toxicity of one medication. Depending on the medications selected, this proposal can be an option. An exception to this proposal is the use of the newer biologic medications as described below. An individual who has been using strong topical steroids over large areas of their body for prolonged periods may benefit from stopping the steroids for a while and rotating onto a different therapy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_creams_lotions_and_home_remedies_are_available_for_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Topical (skin applied) treatments include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">topical corticosteroids</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin D</a> analogue creams like calcipotriene (Calcitrene, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcipotriene-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Dovonex</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcipotriene-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Sorilux</a>), topical retinoids (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tazarotene-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tazarotene</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tazarotene-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tazorac</a>]), moisturizers, topical immunomodulators (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tacrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">tacrolimus</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pimecrolimus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">pimecrolimus</a>), coal tar, anthralin, and others.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_psoriasis_shampoos_available" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Coal tar shampoos are very useful in controlling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/psoriasis_of_the_scalp_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">psoriasis of the scalp</a>.

They are produced by living cells cultures in an industrial setting. They are all proteins and therefore must be administered through the skin because they would otherwise be degraded during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestion</a>. All biologics work by suppressing certain specific portions of the immune inflammatory response that are overactive in psoriasis. A convenient method of categorizing these drugs is on the basis of their site of action:</p>.<p>Drug choice can be complicated, and your physician will help in selecting the best option. In some patients. it may be possible to predict drug efficacy on the basis of a prospective patient's genetics. It appears that the presence of the HLA-Cw6 gene is correlated with a beneficial response to ustekinumab.</p>.<p>Newer drugs are in development and no doubt will be available in the near future. As this class of drugs is fairly new, ongoing monitoring and adverse effect reporting continues and long-term safety continues to be monitored. Biologics are all comparatively expensive especially in view of the fact they none of them are curative. Recently, the FDA has attempted to address this problem by permitting the use of "biosimilar" drugs. These drugs are structurally identical to a specific <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/biologics_biologic_drug_class/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">biologic drug</a> and are presumed to produce identical therapeutic responses in human beings to the original, but are produced using different methodology. Biosimilars ought to be available at some fraction of the cost of the original. If this will be an effective approach remains to be seen. The only biosimilar available currently is infliximab (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infliximab-dyyb/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Inflectra</a>). Two other biosimilar drugs have been accepted by the FDA, an etanercept equivalent (Erelzi) and an adalimumab equivalent (Amjevita) -- but currently, neither are available.</p>.<p>Some biologics are to be administered by self-injections for home use while others are given by intravenous infusions in the doctor's office. Biologics have some screening requirements such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a> screening test (<span class="CrossLinkHighLight"><span class="CrossLinkHighLight">TB</span><span style="display:none"></span></span><span style="display:none"></span> skin test or PPD test) and other labs prior to starting therapy. As with any drug, side effects are possible with all biologic drugs. Common potential side effects include mild local injection-site reactions (redness and tenderness). There is concern of serious infections and potential <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">malignancy</a> with nearly all biologic drugs. Precautions include patients with known or suspected <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis B</a> infection, active <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a>, and possibly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">HIV/AIDS</a>. As a general consideration, these drugs may not be an ideal choice for patients with a history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> and patients actively undergoing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a> therapy. In particular, there may be an increased association of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lymphoma</a> in patients taking a biologic.</p>.<p>Biologics are expensive medications ranging in price from several to tens of thousands of dollars per year per person. Their use may be limited by availability, cost, and insurance approval. Not all insurance drug plans fully cover these drugs for all conditions. Patients need to check with their insurance and may require a prior authorization request for coverage approval. Some of the biologic manufacturers have patient-assistance programs to help with financial issues. Therefore, choice of the right medication for your condition depends on many factors, not all of them medical. Additionally, convenience of receiving the medication and lifestyle affect the choice of the right biologic medication.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_an_anti-psoriasis_diet" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most patients with psoriasis seem to be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">overweight</a>. Since there is a predisposition for those patients to develop cardiovascular disease and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, it is suggested strongly that they try to maintain a normal body weight. Although evidence is sparse, it has been suggested that slender patients are more likely to respond to treatment.</p>.<p>Although dietary studies are notoriously difficult to perform and interpret, it seems likely that an anti-inflammatoryÂ <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> whose fat content is composed of polyunsaturated oils like olive oil and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/omega-3_fatty_acids/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fish oil</a> is beneficial for psoriasis. The so-called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mediterranean_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Mediterranean diet</a> is an example.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_light_therapy_for_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Light therapy is also called phototherapy. There are several types of medical light therapies that include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puva_therapy_photochemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PUVA</a> (an acronym for psoralen + UVA), UVB, and narrow-band UVB. These artificial light sources have been used for decades and generally are available in only certain physician's offices. There are a few companies who may sell light boxes or light bulbs for prescribed home light therapy.</p>.<p>Natural sunlight is also used to treat psoriasis. Daily short, controlled exposures to natural sunlight may help or clear psoriasis in some patients. Skin unaffected by psoriasis and sensitive areas such as the face and hands may need to be protected during sun exposure.</p>.<p>There are also multiple newer light sources like lasers and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/photodynamic_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">photodynamic therapy</a> (use of a light activating medication and a special light source) that have been used to treat psoriasis.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puva_therapy_photochemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PUVA</a> is a special treatment using a photosensitizing drug and timed artificial-light exposure composed of wavelengths of ultraviolet light in the UVA spectrum. The photosensitizing drug in PUVA is called psoralen. Both the psoralen and the UVA light must be administered within one hour of each other for a response to occur. These treatments are usually given in a physician's office two to three times per week. Several weeks of PUVA is usually required before seeing significant results. The light exposure time is gradually increased during each subsequent treatment. Psoralens may be given orally as a pill or topically as a bath or lotion. After a short incubation period, the skin is exposed to a special wavelength of ultraviolet light called UVA. Patients using PUVA are generally sun sensitive and must avoid sun exposure for a period of time after PUVA. Common side effects with PUVA include burning, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> of the skin, increased brown spots called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/freckles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lentigines</a>, and an increased risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin cancer</a>, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">melanoma</a>. The relative increase in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">skin cancer</a> risk with PUVA treatment is controversial. PUVA treatments need to be closely monitored by a physician and discontinued when a maximum number of treatments have been reached.</p>.<p>Narrow-band UVB phototherapy is an artificial light treatment using very limited wavelengths of light. It is frequently given daily or two to three times per week. UVB is also a component of natural sunlight. UVB dosage is based on time and exposure is gradually increased as tolerated. Potential side effects with UVB include skin burning, premature <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">aging</a>, and possible increased risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_melanoma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">skin cancer</a>. The relative increase in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/skin_cancer_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">skin cancer</a> risk with UVB treatment needs further study but is probably less than PUVA or traditional UVB.</p>.<p>Sometimes UVB is combined with other treatments such as tar application. Goeckerman is a special psoriasis therapy using this combination. Some centers have used this therapy in a "day care" type of setting where patients are in the psoriasis treatment clinic all day for several weeks and go home each night.</p>.<p>Recently, a laser (excimer laser XTRAC) has been developed that generates ultraviolet light in the same range as narrow-band ultraviolet light. This light can be beneficial for psoriasis localized to small areas of skin like the palms, soles, and scalp. It is impractical to use in in extensive disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_long-term_prognosis_with_psoriasis_what_are_complications_of_psoriasis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Overall, the prognosis for most patients with psoriasis is good. While it is not curable, it is controllable.
