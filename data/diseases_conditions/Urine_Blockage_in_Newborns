<p><b><a name="types_of_defects_in_the_urinary_tract" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hydronephrosis can result from many 
types of defects in the urinary tract. Doctors use specific terms to describe 
the type and location of the blockage. </p>.<p><b><a name="syndromes_that_may_affect_the_urinary_tract" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In addition to defects that occur 
in a single spot in the urinary tract, some babies are born with genetic 
conditions that affect several different systems in the body. A condition that 
includes multiple, seemingly unrelated problems, is called a syndrome. </p>.<p><b><a name="diagnosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Birth defects and other problems of the urinary tract may be 
discovered before the baby is born, at the time of birth, or later, when the 
child is brought to the doctor for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infection</a> or urination 
problem. </p>.<p><b>Prenatal Screening</b></p>.<p>Tests during pregnancy can help determine if the baby is 
developing normally in the womb. </p>.<p><b>Examination of Newborn</b></p>.<p>Sometimes a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">newborn</a> does not urinate as 
expected, even though <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prenatal</a> testing showed no sign of urine blockage. The 
baby may urinate only small amounts or not at all. An enlarged kidney may be 
felt during the newborn examination as well. Different imaging techniques are 
available to determine the cause of the problem.</p>.<p><b>Later Diagnosis</b></p>.<p>Sometimes urine blockage is not 
apparent until the child develops the symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_in_adults/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infection</a>. 
These symptoms include </p>.<p>If these symptoms persist, the child should be seen by a doctor. For any 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> in the first 2 months of life, the child should be seen by a doctor 
immediately. The doctor will ask for a urine sample to test for bacteria. The 
doctor may also recommend imaging tests including ultrasound, VCUG, or nuclear 
scan. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of 
the blockage. Hydronephrosis discovered before the baby is born will rarely 
require immediate action, especially if it is only on one side. Often the 
condition goes away without any treatment before birth or sometimes after. The 
doctor will keep track of the condition with frequent ultrasounds. With few 
exceptions, treatment can wait until the baby is born. </p>.<p><b>Prenatal Shunt</b></p>.<p>If the urine blockage threatens the life of the unborn baby, 
the doctor may recommend a procedure to insert a small tube, called a shunt, 
into the baby's bladder to release urine into the amniotic sac. The placement of 
the shunt is similar to an amniocentesis, in that a needle is inserted through 
the mother's abdomen. Ultrasound guides the placing of the shunt. This fetal 
surgery carries many risks, so it is performed only in special circumstances, 
such as when the amniotic fluid is absent and the baby's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a> aren't developing 
or when the kidneys are very severely damaged. </p>.<p><b>Antibiotics</b></p>.<p>Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. A newborn with 
possible urine blockage or VUR may be given antibiotics to prevent urinary tract 
infections from developing until the urinary defect corrects itself or is 
surgically corrected. </p>.<p><b>Surgery</b></p>.<p>If the urinary defect doesn't correct itself and the child continues 
to have urine blockage, surgery may be needed. The decision to operate depends 
upon the degree of blockage. The surgeon will remove the obstruction to restore 
urine flow. A small tube, called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stent</a>, may be placed in the ureter or urethra 
to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs. </p>.<p><b>Intermittent Catheterization</b></p>.<p>If the child has urine retention because of 
nerve disease, the condition may be treated with intermittent catheterization. 
The parent, and later the child, will be taught to drain the bladder by 
inserting a thin tube, called a catheter, through the urethra to the bladder. 
Emptying the bladder in this way helps prevent kidney damage, overflow

agencies are working to understand the causes of urinary birth defects and to 
find more effective treatments. Through its Pediatric Urology Program, the 
National Institute of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diabetes</a> and Digestive and Kidney Diseases funds research 
into bladder and urinary tract development, prenatal interventions for urinary 
tract disorders, and bladder abnormalities associated with spina bifida. 
Additionally, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Child Health</a> and 
Human Development has established the Birth Defects Initiative to study the 
genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying developmental processes of the 
fetus. </p>.<p><b><a name="for_more_information" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>American Urological Association, Inc.<br>
