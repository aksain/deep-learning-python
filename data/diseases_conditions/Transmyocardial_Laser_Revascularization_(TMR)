<p><b><a name="how" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>TMR is a surgical procedure.  It is performed through a small incision in either the left side or the middle of the chest.  Frequently, it is performed along with coronary bypass surgery, occasionally alone.</p>.<p>Once the incision is made, the surgeon exposes the heart muscle.  A laser hand piece is then positioned on the area of the heart to be treated.  A special high-energy, computerized CO<sub>2</sub> laser is used to create between 20 to 40 one-millimeter-wide channels (about the width of the head of a pin) in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">left ventricle</a> (left lower pumping chamber) of the heart.  The doctor determines how many channels to create during the procedure.  The outer areas of the channels close, but the inside of the channels remain open inside the heart to improve blood flow.</p>.<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> Heart Laser uses a computer to direct laser beams to the appropriate area of the heart in between heartbeats, when the ventricle is filled with blood and the heart is relatively still.  This helps to prevent electrical disturbances (arrhythmias) in the heart.</p>.<p>Doctors aren't sure how TMR improves blood flow to the heart.  Clinical evidence suggests blood flow is improved in two ways:</p>.<p>TMR usually takes one to two hours.  The procedure may last longer if it is combined with other heart procedures.</p>.<p><b><a name="who" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>TMR is a treatment option for individuals who:</p>.<p>TMR has shown positive clinical benefits for patients who may require one or two bypass grafts, yet also have other areas of the heart that are not able to be bypassed with direct bypass-surgery.  This is often seen in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>.  The surgeon will bypass the targeted blockages and use the CO<sub>2</sub> Heart Laser on the heart muscle with diffuse disease to achieve more complete blood flow to the heart.</p>.<p>TMR is not suitable for patients whose:<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="tests" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor will first evaluate your medical condition and review your medical history.

If you are eligible, the doctor will discuss the benefits and risks.</p>.<p><b><a name="work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In a study - published by <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> (1999), 72% of patients who had TMR experienced an improvement in angina symptoms after 12 months, compared to only 13% patients who were receiving medications for the treatment of their angina symptoms.

The length of stay depends on your overall health and rate of recovery.  Your doctor and surgeon will evaluate you after the surgery and determine when you should return home.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="improved" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>After TMR, some patients feel immediate relief from angina symptoms, while others feel improvement over time.  Some patients do not have improved symptoms after TMR, but may have improved activity tolerance.  After TMR, you may still be required to take medications to help your heart and improve blood flow to the heart.  You will need to meet with a cardiologist for frequent follow-up visits so your progress after TMR can be evaluated.</p>.<p><b><a name="active" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your doctor will discuss specific activity guidelines that are appropriate for you after your procedure.  A supervised cardiac rehabilitation program is recommended to help guide your recovery and help you progress your activity level.</p>
