Preparation involves recontouring these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them. Next, impressions of your teeth are made, which serve as a model from which the bridge, pontic, and crowns will be made by a dental laboratory. Your dentist will make a temporary bridge for you to wear to protect the exposed teeth and gums while your bridge is being made.</p>.<p>During the second visit, your temporary bridge will be removed and the new permanent bridge will be checked and adjusted, as necessary, to achieve a proper fit. Multiple visits may be required to check the fit of the metal framework and bite. This is dependent on each individual's case. If the dental bridge is a fixed (permanent) bridge, your dentist may temporarily cement it in place for a couple of weeks to make sure it is fitting properly. After a couple weeks, the bridge is permanently cemented into place.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_much_do_dental_bridges_cost" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cost of dental bridges varies depending on the type of bridge selected and the area of the country in which the procedure is performed. Dental insurance will typically pay a percentage of the fee depending on the individual dental plan.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_do_dental_bridges_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Dental bridges can last 5 to 15 years and even longer. With good oral hygiene and regular prophylaxis, it is not unusual for the life span of a fixed bridge to be over 10 years.</p>.<p><b><a name="will_it_be_difficult_to_eat_with_a_dental_bridge" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Replacing missing teeth should actually make eating easier. Until you become accustomed to the bridge, eat soft foods that have been cut into small pieces.</p>.<p><b><a name="will_the_dental_bridge_change_how_i_speak" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It can be difficult to speak clearly when teeth are missing in the front or anterior areas. Wearing a dental bridge with the anterior teeth in their proper relationship will help you speak properly.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_care_for_my_bridges" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It is important to keep your remaining teeth healthy and strong as the success of the bridge (depending on the type selected) depends on the solid foundation offered by the surrounding teeth. Brushing twice a day and flossing daily helps prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tooth decay</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gum_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gum disease</a> that can lead to tooth loss. Your dentist or dental hygienist can demonstrate how to properly brush and floss your teeth. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule will help diagnose problems at an early stage when treatment has a better prognosis. Selecting a balanced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> for proper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nutrition</a> is also important.</p>.<p>Reviewed by the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.</p>.<p class="credits">
