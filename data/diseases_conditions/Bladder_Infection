<p><b><a name="what_is_the_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The bladder is a hollow muscular organ that is located in the pelvis. The bladder has two functions: one is to store urine and the other is to release/expel urine. Urine drains from the kidneys (one on each side of the body), down the ureters (one on each side of the body), and into the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder where it remains until urination. When it is time to urinate, the bladder muscle contracts and the outlet of the bladder and sphincter muscles relax to allow urine to pass through the urethra to leave the body. The bladder and urethra are part of the lower urinary tract, whereas the kidneys and ureters are part of the upper urinary tract.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_bladder_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder. Most cystitis is from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">bacterial infections</a> involving the bladder and less commonly may be the result of yeast infections, viral infections, chemical irritants of the bladder, or for unknown reasons (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interstitial_cystitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">interstitial cystitis</a>). Bladder infection (infectious cystitis) is a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infection</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">UTI</a>). This review will specifically address infectious cystitis.</p>.<p>The urine in the bladder is normally free of bacteria (sterile). However, bacteria may be present in the bladder but not cause inflammation or symptoms of an infection. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria and is not cystitis.</p>.<p>Cystitis can be complicated or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated cystitis is a bladder infection in a healthy person with a structurally and functionally normal urinary tract. A complicated bladder infection is one that occurs in association with factors that increase the chance of developing a bacterial infection and decrease the chance of antibiotic therapy being effective. Such abnormalities include obstruction from stones, congenital blockages, urethral strictures, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benign_prostatic_hyperplasia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostate enlargement</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_bladder_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>All <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infections</a> are the result of interactions between the infecting organism (bacteria, yeast, virus), the number of the organisms that are present in the bladder, and the body’s ability to fight off the organism (host defense mechanisms).</p>.<p>The most common way bacteria gain access to the urinary system from outside is through the urethra (the tube that allows urine to pass from the bladder to outside of the body).</p>.<p>In terms of specific bacteria, <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli</a></i> (<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Escherichia coli</a></i>) is by far the most common organism responsible for bladder infection or cystitis. Staphylococcal (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">staph</a>) organisms (from skin) and other gut bacteria (<i>Proteus</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>) are other bacteria that can cause cystitis and other forms of urinary infections. The type of organism causing the infection can vary with the individual’s age. For example, <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Staphylococcus</a> saprophyticus</i>, a skin bacteria, causes approximately 10% of symptomatic bladder infections in young sexually active women, whereas it rarely causes bladder infections in males and elderly individuals.</p>.<p>Rarely, bladder infection can be caused by a fungus. <i>Candida</i> is the most common fungus to cause bladder infection. <i>Candida</i> infections of the bladder and urinary tract are much less common than bacterial infections. Bladder infections from <i>Candida</i> can occur in patients whose immune system is weakened, individuals who have been treated with powerful antibiotics for other infections, and individuals who have had indwelling urinary catheters.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Viruses</a> can rarely cause bladder infections. Viral cystitis can occur in individuals after bone marrow transplantation and in other individuals with a weakened immune system (immunocompromised individuals). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Adenovirus</a> can cause bladder infections and BK virus is another virus that can cause bladder infections in individuals who have undergone bone marrow transplantation.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_risk_factors_for_bladder_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Female gender is one of the main risk factors for bladder infection.

In most cases, a voided urine specimen is use, however, there is a risk of contamination by skin bacteria. A catheterized urine sample is more accurate, but has the risk of introducing bacteria into the bladder.</p>.<p>The method of collecting a voided urine sample differs between men and women, as well as between circumcised men and uncircumcised men. In circumcised men, there is no special preparation. However, in uncircumcised men, the foreskin should be retracted. If the source of the infection is unclear, three separate urine samples may be collected: the first void (the first 10 ml of urination) reflects whether or not bacteria are in the urethra; and the second sample is a midstream void (that which occurs after the first 10 ml) and reflects whether or not bacteria are in the bladder. If there is a concern for bacteria in the prostate, a rectal examination is performed and the prostate massaged to express fluid from the prostate into the urethra, and the third urine sample is obtained after the prostate massage. In both males and females, the urine should be collected midstream. It is unclear if washing the penis or perineum with gauze or an antibiotic wipe is more effective in preventing contamination from the skin. In children who are not toilet-trained, a catheterized specimen is more accurate than placing a collection bag over the urethra. In infants, a health care professional can perform a suprapubic aspiration (placing a small needle through the lower abdomen into the bladder and withdrawing a urine sample). In toilet-trained children, a health care professional may obtain a voided urine sample.</p>.<p>A quick office-based urinalysis, called a urine dipstick, is unable to detect if bacteria are present. However, it is used to detect the presence of nitrite in the urine and leukocyte esterase. Nitrite is a chemical that is formed when bacteria in the urine break down a chemical called nitrate, which is normally present in the urine. In addition, the urine dipstick is unable to determine the number of white blood cells (infection cells) present in the urine but assesses whether or not white blood cells are present by measuring leukocyte esterase activity. Leukocyte esterase is a chemical produced by white blood cells. The presence of both nitrites and an elevated leukocyte esterase are very suggestive of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">urinary tract infection</a>. The absence of nitrite does not mean that there is not an infection, because not all bacteria can break down nitrate to nitrite.</p>.<p>A formal urinalysis with examination of the urine under the microscope is able to identify whether or not bacteria are present in the urine as well as determine the number of white blood cells present in the urine. Examination of the urine under the microscope can also determine if yeast are present in the urine. Viruses cannot be seen under the routine microscope and require special tests to identify.</p>.<p>The definitive test to determine if there is a bladder infection is the urine culture. The urine culture identifies the number of and type of bacteria in the urine as well as determine the sensitivity of the bacteria to a number of different antibiotics. The usual cutoff for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">urinary tract infection</a> is the presence of greater than 10,000 bacteria, however, in the presence of symptoms, even fewer bacteria in the urine is supportive of a urinary tract infection.</p>.<p>If symptoms of an upper urinary tract infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, flank pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> or vomiting are present, a blood test, a complete blood cell count (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>) is often obtained. If there is a concern for a severe infection, a sample of blood will be cultured to see if there are bacteria in the bloodstream. Radiologic studies are not routinely obtained in the case of cystitis, however, if there are signs of a kidney infection such as flank pain, fevers/chills, or there is a failure to respond to antibiotics (with persistent or worsening symptoms), then radiologic testing (renal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a>) can be performed to rule out an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abscess</a> or other abnormalities.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatment_options_and_medications_for_a_bladder_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bladder infection can be treated and cured by appropriate use of antibiotics. The selection and duration of antibiotic treatment depends on severity of the infection, previous history of similar infection, and patient factors (age, gender, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergies</a>, other medications, other medical problems). The antibiotic initially chosen will be dependent on these factors as well as urine culture results from prior infections. Sometimes the antibiotic will be changed if the urine culture results show that the bacteria is resistant to the antibiotic used initially. In most bladder infections, oral (by mouth) antibiotics are used. The length of treatment will vary with whether or not the infection is complicated or not, as well as other risk factors. Sometimes intravenous antibiotics may be needed until a suitable oral antibiotic has been identified. A number of different types of antibiotics have been used to treat bladder infections, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trimethoprim/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">trimethoprim</a>-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfamethoxazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sulfamethoxazole</a><span class="CrossLinkHighLight" id="CrossLink_53"> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sulfamethoxazole_and_trimethoprim/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Bactrim</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrofurantoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitrofurantoin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrofurantoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Macrobid</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrofurantoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Furadantin</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrofurantoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Macrodantin</a>), fosfomycin (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fosfomycin_tromethamine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Monurol</a>), cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Resistance to various antibiotics varies in different areas of the country, and this may also affect the antibiotic that your physician chooses initially until the culture results are available. It often takes up to 72 hours, sometimes longer, to have the final culture result and antibiotic sensitivities available.</span></p>.<p>Self-medication for bladder infection is occasionally an option in patients with mild, recurrent infections. In reliable and compliant individuals who are familiar with the symptoms of frequent bladder infections, appropriate bladder infection antibiotics can be prescribed to them in advance by their treating physicians. The bladder infection medication may then be started by the patient on their own at the onset of their symptoms. If the symptoms do not improve after several days of treatment, a urine culture will be needed to ensure that the proper antibiotic is being used.</p>.<p>Bladder <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle spasm</a> and bladder inflammation are responsible for some of the symptoms associated with bladder infection, such as bladder pain, urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phenazopyridine-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Phenazopyridine</a> (Pyridium) is a medication often used to treat symptoms of painful urination due to bladder infection. Other similar medications are available over the counter.</p>.<p>Prophylactic antibiotics (a low dose of antibiotic on a daily basis) is sometimes recommended for individuals who develop frequent symptomatic UTIs. Similarly, women who develop UTIs related to sexual activity may take a single dose of antibiotic around the time of intercourse.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_home_remedies_effective_for_a_bladder_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cranberry_vaccinium_macrocarpon-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Cranberry</a> products have been known to prevent bladder infections to some degree, although it is not advised to use them in lieu of antibiotics for treating an infection.</p>.<p>Adhering to the prescribed antibiotic regimen and staying well hydrated are essential components of home remedy for bladder infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_a_bladder_infection_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In pregnant women, bladder infection can be complicated. Sometimes the presence of bacteria without obvious signs of infection in pregnant patients could be harmful and may lead to severe infections and the pregnancy can be compromised. The choice of antibiotics during pregnancy may be different for bladder infection during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus and thus, careful evaluation by a physician is very important to start the correct therapy promptly.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_potential_complications_of_a_bladder_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications of a bladder infection can occur if it is not appropriately diagnosed or treated. Untreated or poorly treated bladder infection can ascend the urinary system and lead to kidney infection (pyelonephritis) and enter the bloodstream, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sepsis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sepsis</a> (infection spread into the blood), which can be life-threatening. In children, particularly, kidney infections can cause permanent damage to the kidney. In pregnant women, complications of bladder infections include an increased risk of delivering low birth weight or premature infants. Urethral narrowing (stricture) in men from recurrent urethral infections can occur, more commonly with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sexually transmitted diseases</a> such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gonorrhea_in_women/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gonorrhea</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_bladder_infections" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although the use of cranberry products (whole cranberries, cranberry juice, cranberry pills) is thought to help prevent infections, more recent evidence fails to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness in preventing UTIs.</p>.<p>Regular voiding and bowel habits may help decrease the risk of bladder infections. Timely and effective bladder emptying as well as avoiding <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a> may decrease the number of bacteria present near the urethra and decrease the likelihood of bacteria growing in the bladder.</p>.<p>Strict adherence to guidelines to prevent catheter associated urinary tract infections is helpful in reducing bladder infections. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has developed guidelines with respect to appropriate urinary catheter use, proper techniques for insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/ca_uti/uti.html). Individuals who perform clean intermittent catheterization (insertion of a catheter to drain the bladder and removal several times a day) and who develop frequent infections may change to single use systems.</p>.<p>Sexual intercourse is another potential risk factor for bladder infection. Thus, it may be advisable to empty the bladder (urinate) after sexual activity, draining bacteria that could have entered the bladder. This is not completely supported by available clinical data and is not recommended by some experts. The use of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of intercourse may also be helpful in individuals with recurrent UTIs related to sexual activity.</p>.<p>Preventive use of antibiotics may also have a role in preventing bladder infections. In some female patients with frequent bladder infections (more than three to four times per year) or with symptoms of bladder infection present after sexual intercourse, a short course of antibiotics can be taken as a preventive measure. This method needs to be recommended by the treating doctor, and the strategy needs to be outlined for patients who are deemed reliable.</p>.<p>Preventive antibiotics are also sometimes recommended in patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures (cystoscopy, prostate biopsy, bladder biopsy). Occasionally, urinalysis and/or urine culture may be ordered before the procedure and if an infection is suggested, then antibiotics are prescribed to prevent an infection after the procedure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_bladder_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The overall prognosis for a bladder infection is very good. An uncomplicated bladder infection typically does not cause any damage to the bladder. Identification of risk factors may help decrease the risk of recurrent infections.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
