Age, gender, and race can affect presentation and the health care professional must consider many variables before reaching a diagnosis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_chest_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pain can be caused by almost every structure in the chest. Different organs can produce different types of pain, unfortunately, the pain is not specific to each cause. Each of the following causes of chest pain will be discussed.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_chest_pain_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The key to diagnosis remains the patient history. Learning about the nature of the pain will give the health care professional direction as to what are reasonable diagnoses to consider, and what are reasonable to exclude. Understanding the quality and quantity of the pain, its associated symptoms and the patient's risk factors for specific disease, can help the doctor assess the probability of each potential cause and make decisions about what diagnoses should be considered and which ones can be discarded.</p>.<p>Differential diagnosis is a thought process that healthcare professionals use to consider and then eliminate potential causes of an illness. As more information is gathered, either from history, physical examination, or testing, the potential diagnosis list is narrowed until the final answer is achieved. Moreover, the patient's response to therapeutic interventions can expand or narrow the differential diagnosis list. In patients with chest pain, many possible conditions may be present, and the health care professional will want to first consider those that are life threatening. Using laboratory and X-ray tests may not be necessary to exclude potentially lethal diseases like heart attack, pulmonary embolus, or aortic dissection when clinical skills and judgment are employed.</p>.<p>The patient may be asked a variety of questions to help the health care professional understand the quality and quantity of the pain. Patients use different words to describe pain, and it is important that the health care professional get an accurate impression of the situation. The questions may also be asked in different ways.</p>.<p>Physical examination helps refine the differential diagnosis. While chest pain may be the initial complaint, often the whole body needs to be examined. Example components of the physical exam may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_philosophy_of_the_approach_to_chest_pain_diagnosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While there are many causes of chest pain, the health care professional will keep those that are potentially lethal front and center in their evaluation of a patient presenting with chest pain. The big three -- heart attack (myocardial infarction), pulmonary embolus, and aortic dissection -- should be considered briefly with every patient, although most of the time their presence can be discarded based upon clinical judgment.</p>.<p>History and physical examination are key in deciding which path to follow in the diagnosis of chest pain. For somebody who fell and hurt his or her ribs, that path is well marked. For an elderly person who presents with vague discomfort and risk factors for an illness, significant testing may need to be done to prove that a given diagnosis is not correct.</p>.<p>The concept of ruling out a diagnosis is difficult for some patients to understand. Instead of proving what is happening, the health care professional is sometimes charged with proving that a life-threatening diagnosis is not present. "Proving what isn't" takes time and technology. A combination of blood tests and imaging studies may take hours to confirm or discard a potential diagnosis.</p>.<p>These tests often are done emergently, and treatment may be started even without a firm diagnosis. For example, if a patient presents with chest pain that the health care professional believes may be angina (pain caused because of narrowing of coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle), then the initial medications to protect the heart will be started at the same time the diagnostic tests are done. Because some heart tests will take hours to complete, the philosophy for this approach is that heart muscle should not be placed at risk while waiting for a diagnosis. If the heart proves to be normal, then the medications are stopped, and the patient can be reassured that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a> has been ruled out. Other diagnoses are also considered at the same time the heart tests are being performed, but ruling out one diagnosis does not confirm another.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_chest_pain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for chest pain depends upon the cause. Many times, situations require that the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment occur at the same time, but when there is opportunity, the sequence of history, physical examination, testing, diagnosis, and treatment should be followed. A synopsis of common chest pain presentations and treatments follows.</p>.<p><b><a name="broken_or_bruised_ribs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bruised or broken ribs are common injuries. Symptoms of broken or bruised ribs include:</p>.<p>The healthcare professional will want to listen to the chest to make certain that there is no associated lung damage. Sometimes, subcutaneous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/emphysema_lung_condition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emphysema</a> can be felt, a sensation of feeling rice krispies when air leaks into the skin. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a> may be done to look for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pneumothorax_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pneumothorax</a> (collapsed lung) or pulmonary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contusion</a> (a bruised lung). Special X-rays looking for rib fracture are not needed since the presence or absence of a fracture will not alter the treatment plan or recuperation time. Special attention will be given to the upper abdomen since the ribs protect the spleen and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, to make certain there are no associated injuries.</p>.<p>The major complication of rib injuries is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a>. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> work like bellows. Normally, when one takes a breath, the ribs swing out and the diaphragm moves down, sucking air into the lungs. Because it hurts to take a deep breath, this mechanism is altered, and the lung underlying the injury may not fully expand because the patient cannot tolerate the pain. The result is stagnant air and lung tissue that does not fully expand, causing a potential breeding ground for a lung infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">pneumonia</a>).</p>.<p>Rib injury treatment may include:</p>.<p><b><a name="costochondritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>On occasion, the joints and cartilage where ribs attach to the sternum (breastbone) may become inflamed. The pain tends to occur with a deep breath, and there is tenderness that can be felt when the sides of the sternum are palpated or touched. If there is swelling and inflammation associated with the tenderness, it is known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/costochondritis_and_tietze_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Tietze</a>'s syndrome.</p>.<p>The most frequent cause for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/costochondritis_and_tietze_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">costochondritis</a> is idiopathic or unknown, meaning there is no explanation for the pain. Other causes include trauma to the area, infection (often viral), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fibromyalgia</a>.</p>.<p>Though painful, the symptoms resolve with symptomatic care, including ice and/or warm compresses and anti-inflammatory medications (for example, ibuprofen). As with other chest wall pain, recovery may take weeks. Taking deep breaths to prevent the risk of pneumonia is very important.</p>.<p>For more, please read the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain_pictures_slideshow_costochondritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Costochondritis</a> and Tietze Syndrome article.</p>.<p><b><a name="pleuritis_or_pleurisy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The lung slides along the chest wall when a deep breath is taken. Both surfaces have a thin lining called the pleura to allow this sliding to occur. On occasion, viral infections can cause the pleura to become inflamed, and then instead of sliding smoothly, the two linings scrape against each other, causing pain. This type of chest pain hurts with a deep breath, and feels like the pain of pleurisy.</p>.<p>Viral infections are a common cause of pleurisy, although there are many other infectious causes including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a>. Other diseases that can inflame the pleura include:</p>.<p>The physical exam may be relatively unremarkable, but a friction rub may be heard over the site of pleural inflammation. If a significant amount of fluid leaks from the inflammation, the space between the lung and the chest wall (the pleural space) can fill with fluid, known as an effusion. When listening with a stethoscope, there may be decreased air entry in the lung. As well, percussion, in which the health care professional taps on the chest wall like a drum, may reveal dullness of one side compared to the other.</p>.<p>Often a chest X-ray is done to assess the lung tissue and the presence or absence of fluid in the pleural cavity.</p>.<p>Pleurisy is usually treated with an anti-inflammatory medication. This will often treat an effusion as well. If the effusion is large and is causing shortness of breath, thoracentesis (thora=chest + centesis=withdrawing fluid) may be done. For thoracentesis, a needle is placed in the pleural space and the fluid withdrawn. Aside from making the patient feel better, the fluid may be sent for laboratory analysis to help with diagnosis. For more, please read the Pleurisy article.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="pneumothorax" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The lung is held against the chest wall by negative pressure in the pleura. If this seal is broken, the lung can shrink down, or collapse (known as pneumothorax). This may be associated with a rib injury or it may occur spontaneously. However, commonly seen in those who are tall and thin, other risk factors for a collapsed lung include emphysema or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a>. Small blebs or weak spots in the lung can break and cause the air leak that breaks the negative pressure seal.</p>.<p>The common presentation is the acute onset of sharp chest pain associated with shortness of breath, with no preceding illness or warning. Physical examination reveals decreased air entry on the affected side. Percussion may show increased resonance with tapping. Chest X-ray confirms the diagnosis.</p>.<p>Treatment is dependent upon what percentage of the lung is collapsed. If it is a small amount and vital signs are stable with a normal O2 sat, the pneumothorax may be allowed to expand on its own with close monitoring. If there is a larger collapse, a chest tube may have to be placed into the pleural space through the chest wall to suck the air out and re-establish the negative pressure. On occasion, thoracoscopy (thoraco=chest +scopy=see with a camera) may be considered to identify the bleb and to staple it shut. For more, please read the Pneumothorax article.</p>.<p>Tension pneumothorax is a relatively rare life-threatening event often associated with trauma. Instead of a simple collapse of the lung, a scenario can exist in which the damaged lung tissue acts as a one-way valve allowing air to enter into the pleural space but not allowing it to escape. The pneumothorax size increases with each breath and can prevent blood from returning to the heart and allowing the heart to pump it back to the body. If not corrected quickly with placement of a chest tube, it can be fatal.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="shingles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sihingles is caused by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">varicella zoster virus</a>, the same one that causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chickenpox</a>.

Unfortunately, the pain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">shingles</a> may begin a few days before the rash emerges and can be confusing to both patient and health care professional, since the pain and burning may seem out of proportion to the findings on physical examination.</p>.<p>The treatment for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/shingles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">shingles</a> includes antiviral medications like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acyclovir</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zovirax</a>) along with pain control medication.

The pulse rate and respiratory rate may be elevated. A fever may be present.

Blood tests may be used to assess the severity of illness and may include a white blood cell count (markedly elevated or abnormally low counts may indicate more severe illness). Oxygen saturation measured with a probe attached to the finger is a way of assessing oxygenation of the blood and is routinely performed on patients with chest pain or shortness of breath. An arterial blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gas</a> can exactly measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream to help determine the level of lung function.</p>.<p>Pneumonia may be caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a> or bacteria. The latter are treated with antibiotics, either by mouth or in the hospital by intravenous infusion.

When a thrombus or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_clot_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood clot</a> forms, it has the potential to break free (now called an embolus) and float downstream, returning to the heart. The embolus can continue its journey through the heart and enter into the pulmonary circulation system, eventually becoming lodged in the branches of the pulmonary artery and cutting off blood supply to part of the lung. This decreased blood flow doesn't allow enough blood to pick up oxygen in the lung, and the patient can become markedly short of breath.</p>.<p>As mentioned above, the common complaints include:</p>.<p>The patient can also have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> and sweat profusely. Depending upon the size of the clot, the initial presentation may be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fainting</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">syncope</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shock</a> in which the patient collapses, with decreased blood pressure and altered mental function.</p>.<p>Depending on the severity of the embolus and the amount of lung tissue at risk, the patient may present critically ill (in extremis) with markedly abnormal vital signs, or may appear rather normal. Physical examination may not be helpful, and the diagnostic studies are done upon clinical suspicion based on history and risk factors.</p>.<p>The diagnosis may be made directly with imaging of the lungs or indirectly by finding a clot elsewhere in the body. The strategy used to make a diagnosis will depend upon each individual patient's situation, but there are some general tools available.</p>.<p>D-Dimer is a blood test that can measure breakdown products of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> in the body but cannot differentiate a pulmonary embolus from a healing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar</a> from surgery, or a bruise from falling. If this test is negative, then a pulmonary embolus can usually be excluded if the patient is in a low risk category to form clots. Cancer and pregnancy are two other situations in which the D-Dimer test is often positive even without blood clots present.</p>.<p>Lungs can be imaged with a ventilation-perfusion scan or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> to look for a clot. Each test has its benefits and limitations, and use of these tests is dependent upon the clinical situation. If there are technical issues so that the lungs cannot be imaged, an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> of the legs may be performed to look for a thrombus; the concept is that if the symptoms are present of a pulmonary embolus and a clot is found in the leg, then the diagnosis can be inferred. However, if the complete clot has broken free, the leg ultrasound may be normal even when a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_embolism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pulmonary embolism</a> is present.</p>.<p>Sometimes direct <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">angiography</a> of the pulmonary arteries may be performed. Catheters are placed into the pulmonary artery, and a dye is injected. This test must be performed by a specially trained radiologist or cardiologist.</p>.<p>The treatment for pulmonary embolus is anticoagulation using either <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heparin-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">heparin</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enoxaparin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">enoxaparin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enoxaparin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Lovenox</a>) initially, and then transitioning to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">warfarin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Coumadin</a>) for long-term treatment. The usual treatment course for anticoagulation for a pulmonary embolus is 3 to 6 months.</p>.<p>The lungs and heart can stop working if there is a large enough clot load. Thrombolytic, or clot busting, therapy may be considered in addition to the basics of oxygen, intravenous fluids, and medicines to support blood pressure. In rare and extreme cases, lytic agents may be directly injected into the area of clot.</p>.<p>Pulmonary embolus should always be considered a life-threatening illness.</p>.<p>For additional information, please read the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis_and_pulmonary_embolism/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Pulmonary Embolism</a> article.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="angina_and_heart_attack_myocardial_infarction" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The worry for patients and health care professionals is that any chest pain may originate from the heart. Angina is the term given to pain that occurs because the coronary arteries (blood vessels to the heart muscle) narrow and decrease the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to the heart itself. This can cause the classic symptoms of chest pressure or tightness with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation</a> to the arm or jaw associated with shortness of breath and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sweating_perspiration_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sweating</a>.</p>.<p>Unfortunately, many people don't present with classic symptoms, and the pain may be difficult to describe -- or in some people may not even be present. Instead of angina or typical chest pressure, their anginal equivalent (symptom they get instead of chest pain) may be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a>, shortness of breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, dizzyness, and malaise. Women and the elderly are at higher risk for having an atypical presentation of heart pain.</p>.<p>The narrowing of blood vessels or atherosclerosis is due to plaque buildup. Plaque is a soft amalgam of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a> and calcium that forms along the inside lining of the blood vessel and gradually decreases the diameter of the blood vessel and restricts the flow of blood. If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot to form and completely block the vessel.</p>.<p>When a coronary artery completely occludes (becomes blocked), the muscle it supplies blood to is at risk of dying. This is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. In most circumstances, this pain is more intense than routine angina, but again, there are many variations in signs and symptoms.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of angina is a clinical one. After the health care professional takes a careful history and assesses the potential risk factors, the diagnosis is either reasonably pursued or else it is considered not to be present. If angina is the potential diagnosis, further evaluation may include electrocardiograms (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EKG</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ECG</a>) and blood tests.</p>.<p>Cardiac enzymes can be measured in the bloodstream when heart muscle is irritated or damaged. Common enzymes to measure include troponin, CPK, and myoglobin. Unfortunately, it takes time for these chemicals to be released into the bloodstream and turn a blood test positive. Interpretation of the test results may require that blood be taken more than once over a period of observation to confirm that they are normal. If these chemicals are not present, it may be reasonable to perform imaging studies of the heart in a variety of ways depending on the patient's past history:</p>.<p>The purpose of making the diagnosis of angina is to restore normal blood supply to heart muscle before a heart attack occurs and permanent muscle damage results. Aside from minimizing risk factors by controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a>, and stopping <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">smoking</a>, medications can be used to make the heart beat more efficiently (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">beta blockers</a>), to dilate blood vessels (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitroglycerin</a>) and to make blood less likely to clot (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a>).</p>.<p><b>An acute heart attack (myocardial infarction) is a true emergency,</b> since complete blockage of blood supply will cause part of the heart muscle to die and be replaced by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar tissue</a>. This lessens the ability of the heart to pump blood to meet the body's needs. As well, injured heart muscle is irritable and can cause electrical disturbances like ventricular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fibrillation</a>, a condition in which the heart jiggles like Jell-O and cannot beat in a coordinated fashion. This is the cause of sudden death in heart attack. The cause of an acute heart attack is the rupture of a cholesterol plaque in a coronary artery. This causes a blood clot to form and occlude the artery.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">treatment for heart attack</a> is emergent restoration of blood supply. Two options include use of a drug like TPA or TNK to dissolve the blood clot (thrombolytic therapy) or emergency heart catheterization and using a balloon to open up the blocked area (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">angioplasty</a>) and keeping it open with a mesh cage called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">stent</a>.

Just like in pleurisy, this sac can become inflamed and cause pain. As opposed to angina, this pain tends to be sharp and is due to the inflamed sac rubbing against the outer layers of the heart.</p>.<p>The most common cause of pericarditis either is a viral illness or is unknown (idiopathic). Inflammatory diseases of the body (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>), kidney failure, and cancer are other conditions that can cause pericarditis. Trauma, especially from steering wheel injuries in motor vehicle accidents can also cause pericarditis.</p>.<p>The pain with pericarditis is intense, sharp, tends to be worse when lying down, and is relieved by leaning forward. Because the pain can be so severe, radiate to the arm or neck, and cause some shortness of breath, it is sometimes mistaken for angina, pulmonary embolus, or aortic dissection. Associated symptoms may include fever and malaise depending upon the cause.</p>.<p>History is helpful in making the diagnosis, looking for a recent viral illness, and asking about past medical history. Physical examination may reveal a friction rub when listening to the heart sounds.</p>.<p>The electrocardiogram may show changes consistent with pericarditis, but on occasion, the EKG may mimic an acute heart attack. Echocardiogram is helpful if there is fluid in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pericardial_sac_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pericardial sac</a> associated with the inflammation.</p>.<p>An anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen is the treatment for pericarditis. Addressing the underlying cause will also direct therapy.</p>.<p>Cardiac tamponade is a complication of pericarditis. Pressure from excess fluid built up in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pericardial</a> sac is so great that it prevents blood from returning to the heart.

It is composed of layers of muscle that need to be strong enough to withstand the pressure generated by the beating heart. In some people, a tear can occur in one of the layers of the aortic wall, and blood can track between the wall muscles. This is called an aortic dissection, and is potentially life threatening. The type of dissection and treatment is dependent upon where in the aorta the dissection occurs. Type A dissections are located in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ascending aorta</a>, which runs from the heart to the aortic arch where blood vessels that supply the brain and arms exit. Type B dissections are located in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">descending aorta</a> that runs through the chest and down into the abdomen.</p>.<p>The majority of aortic dissections occur as a long-term consequence of poorly controlled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high blood pressure</a>. Other associated conditions include:</p>.<p>The pain from aortic dissection occurs suddenly and often is described as intense, stabbing, or ripping. It may be constant, or the pain may be pleuritic (worse with a deep breath). Often it radiates to the back. The pain of dissection is often confused with the pain of heart attack, esophagitis, or pericarditis.</p>.<p>Diagnosis is based upon history, review of the risk factors, physical examination, and clinical suspicion. Physical examination may reveal loss or delay of pulses in the wrist or leg when comparing one side to the other. A new <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_murmur/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart murmur</a> may be detected if the dissection involves the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">aortic valve</a> that connects the aorta with the heart. If blood vessels exiting the aorta are involved in the area of dissection, the organs that they supply may be at risk. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Stroke</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">paralysis</a> can be seen in dissection. Blood supply can be lost to kidneys and bowel and/or to arms and legs.</p>.<p>The diagnosis of aortic dissection is confirmed by imaging, most commonly by CT angiography of the aorta. Echocardiography or ultrasound may also be used to image the aorta.</p>.<p>Type A dissections of the ascending aorta are treated by surgery in which the damaged piece of aorta is removed and replaced with an artificial graft. Sometimes the aortic valve needs to be repaired or replaced if it is damaged.</p>.<p>Type B dissections are initially treated by medications to control blood pressure and maintain it in a normal range. Beta blockers and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcium_channel_blockers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">calcium channel blocker</a> medications are commonly used. If medical therapy fails, surgery may be necessary.</p>.<p>If the dissection tears completely through all three layers of the aortic wall, then the aorta ruptures. This is a catastrophe, and more than 50% of affected patients die before reaching a hospital. The overall mortality of aortic rupture is greater than 80%.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="esophagus_and_reflux_esophagitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The esophagus is a muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is a specialized band of muscle at the lower end of the esophagus that functions as a valve to keep stomach contents from spilling back into the esophagus. Should that valve fail, stomach contents, including acidic digestive juices, can reflux back and irritate the lining of the esophagus. While the stomach has a protective barrier lining to protect it from normal digestive juices, this protection is missing in the esophagus.</p>.<p>Reflux esophagitis (also referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">GERD</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>) can present with burning chest and upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abdominal pain</a> that radiates to the throat and may be associated with a sour taste in the back of the throat called water brash. It may present after meals or at bedtime when the patient lies flat. There can be significant spasm of the esophageal muscles, and the pain can be intense. The pain of reflux esophagitis can be mistaken for angina, and vice versa.</p>.<p>The physical examination is usually not helpful, and a clinical diagnosis is often made without further testing. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Endoscopy</a> may be performed to look at the lining of the esophagus and stomach.
