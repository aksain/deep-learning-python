<p><b><a name="insulin_resistance_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas. These cells are scattered throughout the pancreas in small clusters known as the islets of Langerhans. The insulin produced is released into the blood stream and travels throughout the body. Insulin is an essential hormone that has many actions within the body. Most actions of insulin are directed at metabolism (control) of carbohydrates (sugars and starches), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipids</a> (fats), and proteins. Insulin also regulates the functions of the body's cells, including their growth. Insulin is critical for the body's use of glucose as energy.</p>.<p>Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition in which the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. That is, the normal response to a given amount of insulin is reduced. As a result, higher levels of insulin are needed in order for insulin to have its proper effects, and the pancreas compensates by trying to produce more insulin. This resistance occurs in response to the body's own insulin (endogenous) or when insulin is administered by injection (exogenous).</p>.<p>With insulin resistance, the pancreas produces more and more insulin until the pancreas can no longer produce sufficient insulin for the body's demands, and then blood sugar rises. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for development of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">heart disease</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are no specific signs and symptoms of insulin resistance.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several causes for insulin resistance, and genetic factors (inherited component) are usually significant. Some medications can contribute to insulin resistance. In addition, insulin resistance is often seen with the following conditions:</p>.<p>Other causes of or factors that may worsen insulin resistance can include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_relationship_between_insulin_resistance_and_diabetes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Type 2 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes mellitus</a> (T2D) is the type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diabetes</a> that occurs later in life or with obesity at any age. Insulin resistance precedes the development of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">type 2 diabetes</a>, sometimes by years. In individuals who will ultimately develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">type 2 diabetes</a>, it has been shown that blood glucose and insulin levels are normal for many years, until at some point in time, insulin resistance develops.</p>.<p>High insulin levels are often associated with central obesity, cholesterol abnormalities, and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">high blood pressure</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypertension</a>). When these disease processes occur together, it is called the metabolic syndrome.</p>.<p>One action of insulin is to cause the body's cells (particularly the muscle and fat cells) to remove and use glucose from the blood. This is one way by which insulin controls the level of glucose in blood. Insulin has this effect on the cells by binding to insulin receptors on the surface of the cells. You can think of it as insulin "knocking on the doors" of muscle and fat cells. The cells hear the knock, open up, and let glucose in to be used. With insulin resistance, the muscles don't hear the knock (they are resistant). So, the pancreas is notified it needs to make more insulin, which increases the level of insulin in the blood and causes a louder knock.</p>.<p>The resistance of the cells continues to increase over time. As long as the pancreas is able to produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, blood glucose levels remain normal. When the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels begin to rise. Initially, this happens after meals - when glucose levels are at their highest and more insulin is needed - but eventually while fasting too (for example, upon waking in the morning). When blood sugar rises abnormally above certain levels, type 2 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diabetes</a> is present.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_normal_insulin_levels" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact values for normal or high insulin levels vary according to the laboratory and the type of test performed. With insulin resistance, there is a high fasting insulin level and a normal to high fasting blood glucose level. High or elevated insulin levels can be seen with other medical conditions as well, including insulin-producing tumors (insulinomas), Cushing syndrome, and fructose or galactose intolerance.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_medical_conditions_are_associated_with_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While the metabolic syndrome links insulin resistance with abdominal obesity, elevated cholesterol, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">high blood pressure</a>; several other medical other conditions are specifically associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may contribute to the following conditions:</p>.<p><b>Type 2 Diabetes:</b> Overt diabetes may be the first sign insulin resistance is present. Insulin resistance can be noted long before type 2 diabetes develops. Individuals reluctant or unable to see a health-care professional often seek medical attention when they have already developed type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.</p>.<p><b>Fatty liver:</b> Fatty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> is strongly associated with insulin resistance. Accumulation of fat in the liver is a manifestation of the disordered control of lipids that occurs with insulin resistance. Fatty liver associated with insulin resistance may be mild or severe. Newer evidence suggests fatty liver may even lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cirrhosis</a> of the liver and, possibly, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b>Arteriosclerosis:</b> Arteriosclerosis (also known as atherosclerosis) is a process of progressive thickening and hardening of the walls of medium-sized and large arteries. Arteriosclerosis is responsible for:</p>.<p>Other risk factors for arteriosclerosis include:</p>.<p><b>Skin Lesions:</b> Skin lesions include increased skin tags and a condition called acanthosis nigerians (AN). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/acanthosis_nigricans_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Acanthosis nigricans</a> is a darkening and thickening of the skin, especially in folds such as the neck, under the arms, and in the groin. This condition is directly related to the insulin resistance, though the exact mechanism is not clear.</p>.<p><b>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/polycystic_ovary_syndrome_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">Polycystic ovary syndrome</a> is a common hormonal problem which affects menstruating women. It is associated with irregular periods or no periods at all (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amenorrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">amenorrhea</a>), obesity, and increased body hair in a male pattern of distribution (called hirsutism; for example, moustache, sideburns, beard, mid-chest, and central belly hair).</p>.<p><b>Hyperandrogenism:</b> With PCOS, the ovaries can produce high levels of the hormone testosterone. This high testosterone level can be seen with insulin resistance and may play a role in causing PCOS. Why this association occurs is unclear, but it appears the insulin resistance somehow causes abnormal ovarian hormone production.</p>.<p><b>Growth abnormalities:</b> High levels of circulating insulin can affect growth. While insulin's effects on glucose metabolism may be impaired, its effects on other mechanisms may remain intact (or at least less impaired). Insulin is an anabolic hormone which promotes growth. Patients may actually grow larger with a noticeable coarsening of features. Children with open growth plates in their bones may actually grow faster than their peers. However, neither children nor adults with insulin resistance become taller than predicted by their familial growth pattern. Indeed, most adults simply appear larger with coarser features. The increased incidence of skin tags mentioned earlier may occur through this mechanism too.</p>.<p><b>Reproductive abnormalities in women</b><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_at_risk_for_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An individual is more likely to have or develop insulin resistance if he or she:</p>.<p><b><a name="which_specialties_of_doctors_treat_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Insulin resistance may be treated by primary care professionals, including internists, family professionals, or pediatricians. Endocrinologists, specialists in hormonal disorders, also treat patients with insulin resistance.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_test_for_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A health-care professional can identify individuals likely to have insulin resistance by taking a detailed history, performing a physical examination, and simple laboratory testing based on individual risk factors.</p>.<p>In general practice, the fasting blood glucose and insulin levels are usually adequate to determine whether insulin resistance and/or diabetes is present. The exact insulin level for diagnosis varies by assay (by laboratory). However, a fasting insulin level above the upper quartile in a non-diabetic patient is considered abnormal.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_insulin_resistance_be_cured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Management of insulin resistance is through lifestyle changes (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a>, exercise, and disease prevention) and medications. Insulin resistance can be managed in two ways. First, the need for insulin can be reduced. Second, the sensitivity of cells to the action of insulin can be increased.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_special_diet_plan_for_treating_insulin_resistance" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The need for insulin can be reduced by altering the diet, particularly the carbohydrates in the diet. Carbohydrates are absorbed into the body as they are broken up into their component sugars. Some carbohydrates break and absorb faster than others; these are referred to having a high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_and_low_glycemic_index_foods/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">glycemic index</a>.

It exerts two actions that help control blood glucose levels. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metformin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Metformin</a> prevents the liver from releasing glucose into the blood, and it increases the sensitivity of muscle and fat cells to insulin, allowing them to remove more glucose from the blood. By these actions, metformin lowers blood insulin levels because lower blood sugar levels tell the pancreas to put out less insulin.</p>.<p>Metformin is a reasonably safe medication when used in the proper population. Although occasionally associated with gastrointestinal side effects, metformin is usually well tolerated.
