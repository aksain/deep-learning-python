The uterus is where a fetus grows. In most nonpregnant women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the cervix, which leads to the vagina.</p>.<p>Cancer of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endometriosis_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">endometrium</a> is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called sarcoma of the uterus.</p>.<p><b><a name="obesity_and_having_metabolic_syndrome_may_increase_the_risk_of_endometrial_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:</p>.<p>Endometrial cancer may develop in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast cancer</a> patients who have been treated with tamoxifen. A patient who takes this drug and has abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vaginal bleeding</a> should have a follow-up exam and a biopsy of the endometrial lining if needed. Women taking estrogen (a hormone that can affect the growth of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Taking estrogen combined with progesterone (another hormone) does not increase a woman's risk of endometrial cancer.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_endometrial_cancer_include_unusual_vaginal_bleeding_or_pain_in_the_pelvis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by endometrial cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="tests_that_examine_the_endometrium_are_used_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_endometrial_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because endometrial cancer begins inside the uterus, it does not usually show up in the results of a Pap test. For this reason, a sample of endometrial tissue must be removed and checked under a microscope to look for cancer cells. One of the following procedures may be used:</p>.<p>Other tests and procedures used to diagnose endometrial cancer include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:</p>.<p>Endometrial cancer can usually be cured because it is usually diagnosed early.</p>.<p><b><a name="after_endometrial_cancer_has_been_diagnosed_tests_are_done_to_find_out_if_cancer_cells_have_spread_within_the_uterus_or_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hysterectomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hysterectomy</a> (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.</p>.<p>The following procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_three_ways_that_cancer_spreads_in_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p><b><a name="cancer_may_spread_from_where_it_began_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>. Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="the_following_stages_are_used_for_endometrial_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.</p>.<p>In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.</p>.<p>In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.</p>.<p>In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.</p>.<p><b>Low-risk endometrial cancer</b></p>.<p>Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.</p>.<p><b>High-risk endometrial cancer</b></p>.<p>Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.</p>.<p><b><a name="recurrent_endometrial_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recurrent endometrial cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the uterus, the pelvis, in lymph nodes in the abdomen, or in other parts of the body.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_endometrial_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p>Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:</p>.<p>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.</p>.<p>Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.</p>.<p><b><a name="patients_may_want_to_think_about_taking_part_in_a_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p><b><a name="patients_can_enter_clinical_trials_before_during_or_after_starting_their_cancer_treatment" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p><b><a name="follow-up_tests_may_be_needed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_by_stage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Low-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2)</b></p>.<p>Treatment of stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.</p>.<p>Treatment of stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>If cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be done.</p>.<p><b>High-risk endometrial cancer (grade 3)</b></p>.<p>Treatment of high-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of stage III endometrial cancer, stage IV endometrial cancer, and recurrent endometrial cancer may include the following:</p>
