<p><b><a name="shock_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_shock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Shock is a life-threatening medical condition as a result of 
insufficient blood flow throughout the body. Shock often accompanies severe 
injury or illness. Medical shock is a medical emergency and can lead to other 
conditions such as lack of oxygen in the body's tissues (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypoxia_and_hypoxemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypoxia</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attack</a> 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sudden_cardiac_death/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiac arrest</a>) or organ damage. It requires immediate treatment as symptoms 
can worsen rapidly. </p>.<p>Medical shock is different than emotional or psychological shock that can 
occur following a traumatic or frightening emotional event. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_types_of_shock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>Septic shock</b> results from bacteria multiplying in the blood and releasing 
toxins. Common causes of this are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infections</a>, 
skin infections (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cellulitis</a>), intra-abdominal infections (such as

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">meningitis</a>. </p>.<p><b>Anaphylactic shock</b> is a type of severe hypersensitivity or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> reaction. 
Causes include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergy</a> to 
insect stings, medicines, or 
foods (nuts, berries, 
seafood), etc.</p>.<p><b>Cardiogenic shock</b> happens when the heart is damaged and unable to supply 
sufficient blood to the body. This can be the end result of a heart attack or 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">congestive heart failure</a>.</p>.<p><b>Hypovolemic shock</b> is caused by severe blood and fluid loss, such as from 
traumatic bodily injury, which makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to 
the body, or severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> 
where there is not enough blood to carry oxygen through the body. </p>.<p><b>Neurogenic shock</b> is caused by 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spinal_cord_injury_treatments_and_rehabilitation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">spinal cord injury</a>, usually as a result 
of a traumatic accident or injury.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_shock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several main causes of shock: </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_shock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure_hypotension_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Low blood pressure</a> 
and rapid heart rate (tachycardia) are the key signs of shock. </p>.<p>Symptoms of all types of shock 
include: </p>.<p>Depending on the type of shock the following symptoms may also be observed:
</p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_i_seek_medical_care_for_shock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Medical shock is a medical emergency. If you suspect shock after an injury, even if the person seems 
stable, call 
911 or get them to an emergency department immediately. Prompt treatment can 
save a person's life. </p>.<p>The sooner shock is treated, the better. When treated quickly there is less 
risk of damage to a person's vital organs. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_shock" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Depending on the type or the cause of the shock, treatments differ. In 
general, fluid resuscitation (giving a large amount of fluid to raise blood 
pressure quickly) with an IV in the ambulance or emergency room is the 
first-line treatment for all types of shock. The doctor will also administer 
medications such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine to the fluids to try 
to raise a patient's blood pressure to ensure blood flow to the vital organs.</p>.<p>Tests (for example, X-rays, blood tests, 
EKGs) will determine the underlying cause 
of the shock and uncover the severity of the patient's illness.</p>.<p><b>Septic shock</b> is treated with prompt administration of antibiotics depending 
on the source and type of underlying infection. These patients are often 
dehydrated and require large amounts of fluids to increase and maintain blood 
pressure.</p>.<p><b>Anaphylactic shock</b> is treated with
diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 
epinephrine 
(an "Epi-pen"), steroid medications 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylprednisolone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">methylprednisolone</a> (Solu-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methylprednisolone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Medrol</a>), 
and sometimes a H2-Blocker medication (for example,
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famotidine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">famotidine</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/famotidine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pepcid</a>],

cause. A patient with a heart attack may require a surgical procedure called a 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiac_catheterization/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiac catheterization</a> to unblock an artery. A patient with congestive heart 
failure may need medications to support and increase the force of the heart's 
beat. In severe or prolonged cases, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_transplant/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart transplant</a> may be the only 
treatment.</p>.<p><b>Hypovolemic shock</b> is treated with fluids (saline) in minor cases, but may 
require multiple blood transfusions in severe cases. The underlying cause of the 
bleeding must also be identified and corrected.</p>.<p><b>Neurogenic shock</b> is the most difficult to treat. Damage to the spinal cord is 
often irreversible and causes problems with the natural regulatory functions of 
the body. Besides fluids and monitoring, immobilization (keeping the spine from 
moving), anti-inflammatory medicine such as steroids, and sometimes surgery are 
the main parts of treatment.</p>.<p><b>Self-Care at Home</b></p>.<p><b><a name="can_shock_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Learn ways to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a>, injuries, dehydration and other causes

patient, and the promptness of treatment and recovery.</p>
