<p>Muscles are complex structures that cause movement in the body. There are three types of muscle in the body:</p>.<p>Skeletal muscles are anchored to bone, either directly or by a tendon. When the muscle contracts, the associated body part moves. This allows arms to lift, legs to run, and the face to smile. Most of these muscles are under willful or conscious control of the brain. This type of muscle is striated or striped with dark-colored muscle fibers containing large amounts of myoglobin, the protein that helps carry oxygen and light-colored fibers that have lesser amounts of the protein. The contraction of a skeletal muscle requires numerous steps within its fibers and cells. The nutrients required to produce energy, oxygen, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolytes</a>, and glucose are supplied by the bloodstream.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Smooth muscle is located in the walls of hollow internal structures in the body, like the arteries, intestines, bladder, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">iris</a> of the eye. They tend to circle the structure and when they contract, the hollow structure is squeezed. These muscles are involuntary and are controlled by the unconscious part of our brain function using the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system always runs in the background, regulating processes within the body. There is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speeds things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slows things down. These names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. Adrenaline (epinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>. Imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster, your palms get sweaty, your eyes dilate, your hair stands on end, and your bowels move, all because the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system that acts to calm us down. Smooth muscle has the same basic contraction mechanism as skeletal muscle, though different proteins are involved.</p>.<p>A muscle spasm, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps_and_muscle_spasms_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">muscle cramp</a>, is an involuntary contraction of a muscle. Muscle spasms occur suddenly, usually resolve quickly, and are often painful.</p>.<p>A muscle spasm is different than a muscle twitch. A muscle twitch, or fasciculation, is an uncontrolled fine movement of a small segment of a larger muscle that can be seen under the skin.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>There are a variety of causes of muscle spasms, and each depends upon predisposing factors, the part of the body involved, and the environment that the body is in.</p>.<p>Spasms may occur when a muscle is overused, tired, previously injured, or strained. The spasm may occur if the muscle has been overstretched or if it has been held in the same position for a prolonged period of time. In effect, the muscle cell runs out of energy and fluid and becomes hyperexcitable, resulting in a forceful contraction. This spasm may involve part of a muscle, the whole muscle, or even adjacent muscles.</p>.<p>Overuse as a cause of skeletal muscle spasm is often seen in athletes who are doing strenuous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> in a hot environment. This is also an occupational issue with construction workers or others working in a hot environment. Usually, the spasms will occur in the large muscles that are strained, being asked to do the work. When this occurs associated with heat exposure, the condition is also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heat_cramps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heat cramps</a>.</p>.<p>Overuse can also occur with routine daily activities like shoveling snow, or mowing or raking grass, causing muscle spasms of the neck, shoulder, and back.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Unfamiliar <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">exercise</a> activities can also cause muscle spasms to occur. Abdominal spasms can occur when a person decides to begin working their abdominal muscles by doing sit-ups and repeating too many too quickly.</p>.<p>Writer's cramps of the hand and fingers are similarly caused by prolonged use of the small muscles in the hand and the overused muscles cramp. People will routinely rest and stretch their fingers either to prevent or treat this situation.</p>.<p>It is commonly thought that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dehydration</a> and depletion of electrolytes will lead to muscle spasm and cramping. Muscle cells require enough water, glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium to allow the proteins within them to develop an organized contraction. Abnormal supply of these elements can cause the muscle to become irritable and develop spasm.</p>.<p>Atherosclerosis or narrowing of the arteries (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peripheral_vascular_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">peripheral artery disease</a>) may also lead to muscle spasm and cramps, again because an inadequate blood supply and nutrients are delivered to the muscle. Peripheral artery disease can decrease the flow of blood to the legs, causing pain in the legs with activity. There may also be associated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle cramps</a>.</p>.<p>Leg spasms are often seen related to exercise, but cramps may also be seen at night involving calf and toe muscles. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria_pnh/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Nocturnal</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leg cramps</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/restless_leg_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">restless legs syndrome</a> are considered a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> disturbance. Their prevalence increases with age and often a precise cause is not found.</p>.<p>Chronic neck and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">back pain</a> can lead to recurrent muscles spasms. Large muscle groups make up the trunk, including the neck, chest wall, upper back, lower back, arms, and legs. Spasms in these muscles can be a result of an injury or they may develop over time because of arthritic changes in the spine. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Obesity</a> can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stress</a> and strain of the core muscles of the trunk, resulting in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">muscle cramps</a> of the neck and upper and lower back. Systemic illnesses like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low red blood cell count</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">kidney disease</a>, and thyroid and other hormone issues are also potential causes of muscle spasms.</p>.<p>Diseases of the nervous system, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple sclerosis</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spinal_cord_injury_treatments_and_rehabilitation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">spinal cord injury</a>, can be associated with muscle spasm.</p>.<p>Smooth muscle can also go into spasm. When a hollow structure filled with air or fluid is squeezed by the muscle spasm, significant pain may occur, since the fluid or air cannot be compressed. For example, smooth muscle in the intestinal wall can go into spasm, causing waves of pain called colic. Colicky pain which tends to come and go may also occur within the bile duct that empties the gallbladder and may develop after eating.</p>.<p>The coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood also have smooth muscle within their walls that may go into spasm. This can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a> that may be indistinguishable from the pain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coronary artery disease</a> (where plaque has accumulated and narrowed the arteries). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Coronary artery spasm</a> often occurs in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smokers</a> or those who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_frequently_asked_questions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high cholesterol</a> blood levels. Coronary artery spasm may be triggered by stress, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_withdrawal_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">alcohol withdrawal</a>, stimulant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drug abuse</a> (especially <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cocaine_and_crack_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cocaine</a>) or medications that can constrict or narrow blood vessels. Coronary artery spasm is also known as Prinzmetal's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">angina</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Dystonias are movement disorders where groups of muscles forcefully contract and cause twisting. Uncontrolled repetitive movements and the inability to maintain normal posture may be the result of this type of muscle spasm and cramping. The symptoms may be very mild initially but gradually progress to become more frequent and aggressive. Occasionally, there is no progression. Examples of this type of muscle spasm include torticollis (where the neck muscles spasm and cause the head to turn to one side), blepharospasm (where there is uncontrolled blinking of the eyes), and laryngeal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dystonia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dystonia</a> that affects the muscles that control speech. Dystonias may be caused by abnormally functioning neurotransmitter chemicals within part of the brain called the basal ganglia. These chemicals (serotonin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dopamine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">dopamine</a>, acetylcholine, and GABA) are required to properly send messages between brain cells that begin muscle contraction. Dystonia symptoms may occur as a complication of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>.</p>.<p>Most people are at risk for developing a muscle spasm at one time in their life, from infant colic to kidney stones. The risks differ depending upon the person's past medical history, their occupation, and level of physical activity. Examples include the following:</p>.<p>The symptoms and signs of muscle spasm depend upon the muscle involved and the circumstances leading up to the spasm.</p>.<p>Skeletal muscle spasm usually involves muscles that are being asked to do excessive work. There is acute onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_pain_myalgia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">muscle pain</a> as it contracts. A bulging, tight muscle may be seen or felt underneath the skin where the muscle is located. Most often, the spasm resolves spontaneously after a few seconds though it may last many minutes or longer. Usually, those affected will feel the need to stretch the muscle involved, thus relieving the spasm and resolving the episode. With heat cramps, the muscle spasm may occur minutes or hours after the activity is completed.</p>.<p>A muscle fasciculation or twitch may last just a few seconds or may be a recurrent event. Usually, it's just a momentary repetitive contraction of just a few muscle fibers of a larger muscle in a localized area served by one nerve fiber. This often involves the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a>, calf, thigh, or thumb. The fasciculations often come and go and may be related to stress, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a>, or ingestion of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">caffeine</a>. The stimulants pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine found in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold</a> medications may also cause this twitch. Medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/albuterol/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">albuterol</a> (Ventolin, Proventil, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/albuterol_pediatric-inhalation_pre-mixed_solution/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">AccuNeb</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/albuterol/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">VoSpire</a>, ProAir) used for the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a> and medications used to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">attention deficit disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amphetamine_and_dextroamphetamine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Adderall</a>) may be associated with twitching. These twitches are considered harmless and are referred to as benign fasciculations.</p>.<p>However, muscle twitching may also be associated with neurologic disorders such as muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myopathy (a primary muscle illness). With these diseases, associated symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, muscle wasting with loss of muscle size, and change in sensation.</p>.<p>Smooth muscle spasm will cause colicky pain that comes and goes. The symptoms will depend upon the organ involved.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Most people have experienced a skeletal muscle spasm due to overexertion, especially in a warm environment, and are able to self-diagnose. However, if the spasms are severe, last a long time, or keep recurring, it is reasonable to see a health-care professional for evaluation.</p>.<p>The diagnosis usually begins with history and physical examination. It is helpful to know the circumstances surrounding the muscle spasms.</p>.<p>Sometimes the physical examination may be normal since the muscle spasms may not be present during the visit. However, the physical examination may useful in detecting underlying health issues that may be helpful in making the diagnosis. For example, if the patient is complaining of leg muscle cramps, the examination may include palpating or feeling for pulses in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>. Atherosclerosis, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack_pathology_photo_essay/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hardening of the arteries</a>, may be associated with the loss of arterial pulse in the involved extremity.</p>.<p>For those having pain from smooth muscle spasm, the pain may be severe enough to present to an emergency department. The history and physical examination will be directed to finding the source of the pain, while at the same time trying to control the symptoms. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stone_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Kidney stone</a> pain (renal colic) and gallbladder pain sometime require anti-inflammatory or narcotic pain medication. They are often associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">vomiting</a> and these symptoms may also require treatment. Some patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">irritable bowel</a> condition may also present with significant intestinal spasm, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">diarrhea</a>.</p>.<p>For patients with recurrent muscle spasm where the cause is not easily diagnosed by history and physical examination, testing may be necessary to give direction as to potential causes. Blood tests may or may not be indicated depending upon the situation and whether or not the diagnosis can be adequately attained by history and physical examination. Blood tests may include a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">complete blood count</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>) looking for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anemia</a>, electrolytes (especially sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium), glucose, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/creatinine_blood_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">creatinine</a> (to check for kidney function). Thyroid function tests may also be considered.</p>.<p>If muscle spasms are prolonged and ongoing, there may be a concern that muscle breakdown and damage is occurring. A creatine phosphokinase (CPK) blood test can be used to detect this. It is an enzyme released into the bloodstream by irritated or damaged muscle tissue. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rhabdomyolysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Rhabdomyolysis</a> can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a>.</p>.<p>If there is concern that the spasms are due to a nerve or muscle disorder, electromyography (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electromyogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">EMG</a>) may be done to determine whether there may be an abnormality of the muscle, of the nerves, or both.</p>.<p>If there is concern about the potential for peripheral artery disease, tests of blood flow to the legs may be considered, including an ankle-brachial index (ABI) which compares blood pressures in the arms and legs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">angiography</a> (often using <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a>) to directly assess the blood vessels.</p>.<p>If nocturnal leg cramps are thought to be associated with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sleep</a> disturbance, sleep studies might be indicated.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Prevention is the key to most skeletal muscle spasm episodes. Since they are often associated with dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, it is important to keep the body well hydrated. If the fluid loss is due to an illness with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a> or vomiting and diarrhea, controlling the symptoms will help limit fluid loss and prevent spasms. Similarly, for those who work or exercise in a hot environment, drinking enough fluids to keep hydrated is very important. It is often helpful to hydrate prior to activities in warm environments.</p>.<p>Muscles should also be prepared for the activity that they are expected to do. Just as athletes stretch and warm up before the game, nonathletes should warm up before heavy labor, including jobs like raking, mowing, and shoveling snow.</p>.<p>Should a large skeletal muscle go into spasm (often referred to as a charley horse), the initial treatment is to gently stretch the muscle back to length to break the spasm cycle and resolve the acute situation. For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">first aid</a> for a hamstring spasm (where the muscles in the back of the thigh are affected) includes straightening the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/knee_joint_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">knee joint</a> and flexing the hip, which stretches the muscles and helps resolve their spasm.</p>.<p>Further treatment will depend upon the underlying cause of the muscle spasms. For muscles that have been damaged or strained, medications may be required for short-term pain relief, including anti-inflammatories (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Motrin</a>]), narcotics, and muscle relaxants.</p>.<p>The treatment of smooth muscle spasm, such as bowel spasm, depends upon diagnosing and treating the underlying cause.</p>.<p>Nocturnal leg cramps are difficult to control and treat. Historically, quinine has been prescribed to help with the muscle spasms, but this drug can have side effects including abnormal bleeding problems. Other medications, including B-complex <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vitamins</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gabapentin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">gabapentin</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diltiazem/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">diltiazem</a>, may be helpful.</p>.<p>Many possible treatments are available for the dystonias. The decision as to which medication to use depends upon the individual situation. It may take trial and error to find the right medication in the right dose to control symptoms.</p>.<p>Primary-care providers treat patients with muscle spasms. Often, the spasms tend not to cause prolonged symptoms that require emergent or urgent care, and the patient sees their regular health care provider for evaluation and treatment.</p>.<p>However, some situations require more aggressive intervention, depending upon the situation, and emergency providers often see those with illnesses associated with smooth muscle spasm, including abdominal or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chest pain</a> that may ultimately be diagnosed as kidney or gallbladder colic, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">irritable bowel syndrome</a>, or esophageal spasm.</p>.<p>Skeletal muscle spasm might be evaluated by emergency physicians when there is also <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthermia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heat-related illness</a> present or there is concern regarding muscle damage.</p>.<p>Different situations may require the services of specific specialists. For example, patients who have leg cramps may have a sleep disorder and may need care by a sleep specialist. Neurologists care for patients with movement disorders. Endocrinologists help control diabetes. Vascular surgeons may be required to discuss treatment options for patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peripheral_vascular_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">peripheral vascular disease</a>.</p>.<p>Most people experience infrequent muscle spasms and do well with prevention (keeping well hydrated and not overusing their body).</p>.<p>However, those who have an underlying medical condition as a cause of muscle spasms often need to treat the original medical problem to help control the muscle spasms. This is especially true for those with peripheral artery disease or movement disorders.</p>.<p>Skeletal muscles cramps or spasms tend to last only a few seconds, and the patient feels the need to stretch the muscle to resolve the spasm.</p>.<p>Smooth muscle cramps may last for a prolonged period of time until the underlying problem that caused the spasm is resolved. Renal colic can last for hours, as can colicky pain with diarrhea or menstrual cramps.</p>.<p>Involuntary muscle twitching is a significant problem because it may last for prolonged time frames and need medications to control or resolve the spasm and the associated pain.</p>.<p><span id="cntid"></span></p>
