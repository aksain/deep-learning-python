<p><b><a name="facts_and_definition_of_menieres_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_menieres_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Meniere's disease is a disorder of the flow of fluids of the inner ear. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_menieres_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although the cause of Meniere's disease is unknown, it probably results from an abnormality in the way fluid of the inner ear is regulated. In most cases only one ear is involved, but both ears may be affected in about 15% of patients. Meniere's disease typically starts between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age (although it has been reported in nearly all age groups). Men and women are equally affected. The symptoms may be only a minor nuisance, or can become disabling, especially if the attacks of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vertigo_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vertigo</a> are severe, frequent, and occur without warning. Meniere's disease is also called idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_menieres_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menieres_disease_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">symptoms of Meniere's disease</a> typically include at least several of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_menieres_disease_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of Meniere's disease is primarily made from the history and physical examination. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_ears_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tinnitus</a> or ear fullness (aural fullness) need to be present to make the diagnosis An audiogram is helpful to show a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a> loss, and to rule-out other abnormalities. It is often helpful, if it can be done safely, to have an audiogram during or immediately following an attack of vertigo. This may show the characteristic low frequency hearing loss. As the disease progresses hearing loss usually worsens.</p>.<p>Other tests such as the auditory brain stem response (ABR), a computerized test of the hearing nerves and brain pathways, computer tomography (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CT scan</a>) or, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MRI</a>) may be needed to rule out a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a> occurring on the hearing or balance nerve. These tumors are rare, but they can cause symptoms similar to Meniere's disease. A full neurological evaluation is performed to exclude other causes of vertigo.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_menieres_disease_be_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although there is no real cure for Meniere's disease, the attacks of vertigo can be controlled in nearly all cases. If you have vertigo without warning, you should not drive, because failure to control the vehicle may be hazardous to yourself and to others.
