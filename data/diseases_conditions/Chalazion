<p><b><a name="chalazion_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_chalazion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A chalazion is a lump in the upper or lower eyelid caused by inflammation of a gland of the lid. It may be soft and fluid-filled or firmer. A chalazion is also referred to as a meibomian <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cyst</a>, tarsal cyst, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">conjunctival</a> granuloma.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_these_eyelid_glands" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Eyelid glands are called the meibomian glands. They are also known as the palpebral glands, tarsal glands, or tarsoconjunctival glands. There are 30-40 of these glands in each of the upper and lower lids. These glands produce a thick liquid secretion that is discharged into the tear film of the eye. This liquid is a mixture of oil and mucus and is called sebum. The liquid acts to maintain lubrication of the surface of the eye. The tiny openings of each of these oil or sebaceous glands are just behind the eyelashes at the lid margins of both the upper and lower eyelids.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_a_chalazion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The narrow opening through which a meibomian gland secretes its material can become clogged from narrowing of the opening or hardening of the sebaceous liquid near the opening. If this occurs, the gland will have a backup of the material it secretes and the obstructed gland will swell. This leads to thickening of the walls of the gland and leakage of oil into the lid itself, causing inflammation both within the gland and the eyelid. This inflamed enlargement is a chalazion.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_a_chalazion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Individuals with thicker Meibomian gland secretions than others have a greater risk of developing a chalazion. If you have had one chalazion, you are at greater risk of developing another one in the future.

This is called a hordeolum, which does resemble a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adult_acne_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pimple</a>, which really is an infected obstruction of an oil gland of the skin. A hordeolum may be tender to touch and resemble a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pustule</a> elsewhere in the body.

This diagnosis can be made by inspection with a penlight with some source of magnification together with palpation (feeling) of the lump.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_specialists_treat_a_chalazion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Your family doctor can make the diagnosis and initiate treatment of a chalazion. If there is a question regarding the diagnosis or the chalazion requires surgical removal, your physician will refer you to an ophthalmologist, a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatments_and_home_remedies_for_a_chalazion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most chalazions are treated with warm compresses to the eyelid to increase the circulation of blood to the inflamed area, encourage eyelid drainage, and promote healing. In addition, the doctor may prescribe an antibiotic drop or ointment to be used immediately after the compresses. If the chalazion persists and is causing an unsightly lump, it can be removed surgically as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia. This excision is ordinarily performed through a small incision located on the inside of the affected lid using local anesthesia and a chalazion clamp. The removal of a chalazion neither alters the normal function of the lid nor decreases the amount of tears. The surgery removes only one gland of the 30 or 40 within the eyelid.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_a_chalazion" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In general, a chalazion does not affect sight. Rarely, the lump itself is large enough to distort the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ocular</a> surface and cause blurring of the vision. The vision will return to normal once the chalazion gets smaller or is removed.
