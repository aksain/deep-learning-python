Ticks are usually harmless. But a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ticks/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tick bite</a> can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lyme disease</a>, which is caused by the bacterium <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>. The bacteria are transmitted to people by the black-legged deer tick, which is about the size of a pinhead and usually lives on deer. Infected ticks can also cause other diseases, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rocky_mountain_spotted_fever_rmsf/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Rocky Mountain spotted fever</a>.</p>.<p>Another insect-borne illness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/west_nile_encephalitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">West Nile virus</a>, is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and usually produces mild symptoms in healthy people. But the illness can be serious for older people and those with compromised immune systems.</p>.<p>Most reactions to bees and other stinging insects are mild, but severe allergic reactions can be deadly. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic reaction</a> can occur even if a person has been stung before with no complications.</p>.<p>Here are tips for preventing and treating bites and stings.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_i_do_to_keep_insects_away" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="whats_the_proper_way_to_use_insect_repellent" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's okay to use insect repellent and sunscreen at the same time. The general recommendation is to apply sunscreen first, followed by repellent. There are also some combination products that contain both insect repellent and sunscreen. FDA regulates sunscreen as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates insect repellent products.</p>.<p><b><a name="whats_the_best_way_to_remove_a_bee_stinger" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It's best to scrape a stinger away in a side-to-side motion with a straight-edged object like a credit card. Don't use tweezers because it may push more venom into the skin. After removing a stinger, wash the area with soap and water. You can apply ice or another <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> compress to help reduce swelling.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_should_i_do_if_i_find_a_tick_on_me_or_my_child" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Wearing light-colored clothing makes it easier to spot ticks. Check for ticks after outdoor activities. If you find a tick, remove it with tweezers. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out. Then drop it in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> bag, seal it up, and throw it away. Early removal of a tick is important because a tick generally has to be on the skin for 36 hours to transmit <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lyme disease</a>. People who want to get a tick tested for disease or other information could check with their local health departments to see if they offer tick testing. After removing a tick, you can cleanse the area of the tick bite with antiseptic, such as rubbing alcohol or soap and water.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_can_be_done_for_itching_and_pain_from_bites_and_stings" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Oral OTC <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antihistamines</a> can bring itch relief. Oral OTC <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can provide relief of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> from bites and stings.</p>.<p>In addition, there are many topical OTC drugs that are applied to the skin and can provide itch and pain relief. Some of these topical OTC drugs are labeled as "external analgesics" or "topical analgesics." They contain ingredients such as hydrocortisone, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pramoxine_and_benzyl_alcohol/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pramoxine</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lidocaine</a>. There are also topical OTC drugs labeled as "skin protectants" that provide itch relief for insect bites and stings.

If you or your child has ever had an allergic reaction to a sting or bite, you should be evaluated by an allergist.

Left untreated, infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system. It is rarely, if ever, fatal. Patients who are treated with antibiotics in the early stages of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely. Antibiotics commonly used for oral treatment include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/doxycycline/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">doxycycline</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amoxicillin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amoxicillin</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cefuroxime/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cefuroxime</a> axetil (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cefuroxime/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ceftin</a>).
