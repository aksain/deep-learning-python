<p><b><a name="one_womans_heart_attack_story" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In 1991, I went to the ER with chest pains twice in one week. They said it was ulcers (bleeding in the stomach).

Again, the ER said there was nothing they could do. I refused to leave and was admitted for observation.

If you have flutters and other symptoms such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a> or shortness of breath, call 911 right away.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="do_women_need_to_worry_about_heart_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes.
