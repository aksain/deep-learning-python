<p><b><a name="mesothelioma_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mesothelioma is a rare form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">malignancy</a>) that most frequently arises from the cells lining the sacs of the chest (the pleura) or the abdomen (the peritoneum). Pleural mesothelioma is the most common form, often becoming apparent with symptoms in the chest area such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>, and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shortness of breath</a>. Shortness of breath often occurs due to a large <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pleural_effusion_fluid_in_the_chest_or_on_lung/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pleural effusion</a> (fluid in the thoracic cavity). Peritoneal mesothelioma is much less common. This can affect the organs in the abdomen, and its symptoms are related to this area of the body, that is, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/distended_stomach_abdominal_distention/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">abdominal swelling</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vomiting</a>, and bowel obstruction. The rarest form of mesothelioma is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pericardial</a> mesothelioma, which involves the sac surrounding the heart.</p>.<p>There are two major cell types of mesothelioma, epithelial and sarcomatoid. Sometimes both of these cell types can be present, also referred to as biphasic. The sarcomatoid type is rarer and occurs in only about 15% of cases; it portends a poorer prognosis. In very rare cases, mesothelioma can originate from benign, non-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a> cells. Surgery cures this so-called benign mesothelioma.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_mesothelioma_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people present with complaints of shortness of breath. They also can have complaints of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chest pain</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">cough</a>. Patients may also be asymptomatic, with the disease discovered by physical exam or an abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a>.</p>.<p>As the disease progresses, shortness of breath increases, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/decreased_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">decreased appetite</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/night_sweats/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">night sweats</a> can develop.

Usually, this involves men over 40 years of age. Others have been exposed to asbestos in a household environment, often without knowing it. The number of new cases of mesothelioma has been relatively stable since 1983, the same time that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) instituted restrictions on asbestos. In Europe, the number of new cases of mesothelioma continues to rise.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_much_asbestos_exposure_does_it_take_to_get_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An exposure of as little as one or two months can result in mesothelioma 30 or 40 years later and in some cases, as much as 70 years later.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_it_take_after_asbestos_exposure_for_mesothelioma_to_show_up" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People exposed in the 1940s, '50s, '60s, and '70s are now being diagnosed with mesothelioma because of the long latency period of asbestos disease.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pathological examination from a biopsy diagnoses mesothelioma. A health care professional removes tissue. Then a pathologist places it under a microscope and makes a definitive diagnosis and issues a pathology report. This is the end of a process that usually begins with symptoms that send most people to the doctor: a fluid buildup around the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> (pleural effusions), shortness of breath, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain in the chest</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> or swelling in the abdomen. The doctor may order an X-ray or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CT scan</a> of the chest or abdomen. If further examination is warranted, the following tests may be done:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Like most <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancers</a>, the prognosis for this disease often depends on how early it is diagnosed and how aggressively it is treated. Unfortunately, oftentimes health care professionals find mesothelioma at a stage in which a cure is unobtainable. Many will succumb to the disease within one year of diagnosis.</p>.<p>Treatment options are determined by the stage of mesothelioma (the extent to which the tumor has spread in the body). There are three staging systems currently in use, and each one measures somewhat different variables.</p>.<p>The oldest staging system and the one most often used is the Butchart system, based mainly on the extent of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a> mass and divides mesotheliomas into four stages.</p>.<p>The more recent TNM system considers variables of tumor in mass and spread, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lymph node</a> involvement, and metastasis.</p>.<p><b>TNM system: variables of T (tumor), N (lymph nodes), and M (metastasis)</b></p>.<p>The Brigham system is the latest system and stages mesothelioma according to resectability (the ability to remove the tumor surgically) and lymph node involvement.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are three traditional kinds of treatment for patients with malignant mesothelioma. Often physicians combine two or more of these in the course of treatment:</p>.<p>Surgery: There are several types of surgery used in treating mesothelioma.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external radiation therapy) or from putting materials that produce radiation (radioisotopes) through thin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> tubes in the area where the cancer cells are (internal radiation therapy).</p>.<p>If fluid has collected in the chest or abdomen, your doctor may drain the fluid out of your body by putting in a needle into the chest or abdomen and using gentle suction to remove the fluid. If a doctor removes fluid from the chest, this is called <i>thoracentesis</i>. If a physician removes fluid from the abdomen, this is called <i>paracentesis</i>. Your doctor may also put drugs through a tube into the chest to prevent more fluid from accumulating.</p>.<p>Health care professionals administer adjuvant radiation in a manner to avoid exposure of the opposite lung to radiation and its potential side effects.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Health care professionals administer chemotherapy by pill, or it may be put into the body by a needle in the vein or muscle. Often, a platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) drug is given along with a second agent, pemetrexed. The side effects can be quite toxic, therefore they are used in people who are physically well enough to tolerate these side effects.</p>.<p>Chemotherapeutic agents can be administered either systemically (through the bloodstream) or intrapleurally (in the pleural cavity). When it is administered intrapleurally, the treatment is localized at the site of the tumor. These drugs are generally very toxic and you should discuss their use very carefully with your physician.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_any_promising_research_or_are_there_promising_drugs_for_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Medical researchers are testing new approaches to treat malignant mesothelioma. They often combine traditional treatments or include something entirely new. They include:</p>.<p>Research is being conducted at various cancer centers all over the United States.</p>.<p>A recent study involving L-NDDP produced two cases of remission in mesothelioma patients. Another study found that a drug known as lovastatin might hold promise for mesothelioma patients.</p>.<p>To learn more about mesothelioma clinical studies and journal medical journal articles, visit the Mesothelioma Web (<a href="http://www.mesotheliomaweb.org" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" target="_blank">http://www.mesotheliomaweb.org</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_other_kinds_of_information_is_available_for_%0Apeople_with_mesothelioma" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are numerous cancer web sites, some specific to mesothelioma.
