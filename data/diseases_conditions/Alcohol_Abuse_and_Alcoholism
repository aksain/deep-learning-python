<p><b><a name="alcohol_use_disorder_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_alcohol_abuse" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alcohol abuse, now included in the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, is a disease. It is characterized by a maladaptive pattern of drinking alcohol that results in negative work, medical, legal, educational, and/or social effects on a person's life. The individual who abuses this substance tends to continue to use it despite such consequences. Effects of alcohol use disorder on families can include increased domestic abuse/<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/domestic_violence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">domestic violence</a>. The effects that parental alcoholism can have on children can be significantly detrimental in other ways as well. For example, the sons and daughters of alcoholics seem to be at higher risk for experiencing more negative feelings, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, and alienation as well as aggression. There are a multitude of negative psychological effects of alcohol use disorder, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and antisocial behaviors.</p>.<p>
Statistics about less severe alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse) in the Unites States include its afflicting about 10% of women and 20% of men. Other alcohol abuse facts and statistics include the following:
</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_alcoholism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Alcoholism formerly called alcohol dependence or alcohol addiction, is the more severe end of the alcohol use disorder spectrum.  It is a destructive pattern of alcohol use that includes tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance, using more alcohol or using it for longer than planned, and trouble reducing its use or inability to use it in moderation. Other potential symptoms include spending an inordinate amount of time getting, using, or recovering from the use of alcohol, compromised functioning, and/or continuing to use alcohol despite an awareness of the detrimental effects it is having on one's life.</p>.<p>Alcoholism is appropriately considered a disease rather than a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a> of character or chosen pattern of bad behavior.  It is the third most common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_illness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mental illness</a>, affecting more than 14 million people in the United States.  Other facts and statistics about alcohol dependence include its pattern of afflicting about 
4% of women and 10% of men.  It costs more than $165 billion per year in lower productivity, early death, and costs for treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_differentiates_alcohol_abuse_from_alcoholism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While both alcohol abuse and alcoholism are included in the alcohol use disorder diagnosis and involve engaging in maladaptive behaviors in the use of alcohol, abuse of this substance does not include the person having withdrawal symptoms or needing more and more amounts to achieve intoxication (tolerance) unless the person has developed alcoholism.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_alcoholism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for developing a drinking problem include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>, or another mood problem in the individual, as well as having parents with alcoholism. Low self-esteem and feeling out of place are other risk factors for developing alcohol dependence. In women, antisocial behaviors and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impulsivity/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impulsivity</a> are associated with the development of severe alcohol use disorder. Both men and women are more likely to develop alcoholism if they have a childhood history of being physically or sexually abused. Children and teens who have their first drink of alcohol between 11 and 14 years of age are more at risk for developing a drinking problem than those who do so when either younger or older.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_alcoholism_is_alcoholism_hereditary" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
One frequently asked question about alcoholism is if it is hereditary. As with most other mental disorders, alcohol addiction has no one single cause and is not directly passed from one generation to another in families. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_alcohol_use__disorder_symptoms_and_signs_in_teenagers_women_men_and_the_elderly" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Signs that indicate a person is intoxicated include the smell of alcohol on their breath or skin, glazed or 
bloodshot eyes, the person being unusually passive or argumentative, and/or a deterioration in the person's appearance or hygiene. Other physical symptoms of the state of being drunk include flushed skin. Cognitively, the person may experience decreased ability to pay attention and a propensity toward <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">memory loss</a>.</p>.<p>
Alcohol, especially when consumed in excess, can affect teens, women, men, and the elderly quite differently.  Women and the elderly tend to have higher blood concentrations of alcohol compared to men and younger individuals who drink the same amount.  Alcoholic women are more at risk for developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cirrhosis</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> 
and heart and nerve damage at a faster rate than alcohol-dependent men.  Interestingly, men and women seem to have similar learning and memory problems as the result of excessive alcohol intake, but again, women tend to develop those problems twice as fast as men.</p>.<p>
Elderly people who drink excessively are at risk for having more serious illnesses, doctor visits, and symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, with less life satisfaction and smaller social support networks compared to senior citizens who have never consumed alcohol. While binge drinking is often thought to be a symptom of young people, an often unknown fact is that a significant percentage of middle-aged and elderly individuals also engage in binge drinking. This behavior increases the risk for driving drunk, no matter what the age.  That, in turn, puts the individual at risk for being arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. 
</p>.<p>
Teenagers who consume alcohol excessively have been found to be at risk for abnormal organ development as the possible result of the hormonal abnormalities caused by alcohol.  This is particularly a risk to their developing reproductive system.  Just a few of the other many dangerous effects of alcohol abuse and alcoholism in teenagers include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_alcohol_use_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As is true with virtually any mental-health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has an alcohol-use disorder.  Screening tools, including online or other tests may help identify individuals who are at risk for having a drinking problem.  Therefore, health-care professionals diagnose alcohol abuse or dependence by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information.  The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary-care doctor perform one.  The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition that might have mental-health symptoms.</p>.<p>
In asking questions about mental-health symptoms, mental-health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from alcohol or other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drug abuse</a> or dependence disorders, as well as depression and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">manic</a> symptoms, anxiety, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hallucinations</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/delusions/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">delusions</a> or behavioral disorders. Physicians may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for substance-use disorders. Since some of the symptoms of alcohol use disorder can also occur in other mental illnesses, the mental-health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from a mood disorder or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias_picture_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety disorder</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/schizoaffective_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">schizoaffective disorder</a>, and other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psychotic_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">psychotic disorders</a>, or personality or behavior disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ADHD</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_stages_of_alcohol__use_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Five stages of alcohol and drug use disorders have been identified. The first stage is described as having access to alcohol rather than use of alcohol. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a person more vulnerable to using alcohol are an issue. The second stage of alcohol use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of alcohol. This or any of the more severe stages of alcoholism may involve binge drinking. The third stage is characterized by individuals further increasing the frequency of alcohol use and/or using the substance on a regular basis. This stage may also include either buying or stealing to get alcohol. In the fourth stage of alcohol use, users have established regular alcohol consumption, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated ("high") and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life as a result of using the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of alcohol use is defined by the person only feeling normal when they are using alcohol. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, engaging in physical fights, or driving while intoxicated increase, and they become most vulnerable to having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">suicidal thoughts</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_alcohol_use_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Prior to entering any inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation program for alcohol use disorder, the possibility that the person with this disorder could suffer from physical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_withdrawal_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">symptoms of alcohol withdrawal</a> needs to be addressed.  People who have a pattern of extensive alcohol abuse are at risk for withdrawal symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>, hallucinations, and even fatal 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a>.  Those individuals will need to enter a detoxification (detox) program that includes the use of close medical support, monitoring, and prescription of medications like 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chlordiazepoxide-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chlordiazepoxide</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chlordiazepoxide-injection/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Librium</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonazepam/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">clonazepam</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonazepam/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Klonopin</a>) 
to help prevent and ease the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.</p>.<p>
There are numerous individual psychotherapeutic treatments for alcoholism. Relapse prevention uses methods for recognizing and amending problem behaviors. Individualized drug counseling specifically emphasizes short-term behavioral goals in an attempt to help the individual reduce or stop the use of alcohol altogether. Cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, like helping the individual with alcohol use disorder recognize what tends to precede and follow their episodes of alcohol use, are often used to address alcohol abuse. Some treatment programs include drug testing. Twelve-step recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are individualized drug-counseling methods. Motivational enhancement therapy encourages the person suffering from alcohol use disorder to increase their desire to participate in therapy. Stimulus control refers to an intervention that teaches the alcohol-use disordered person to stay away from situations that are associated with alcohol use and to replace those situations with activities that are contrary to using alcohol. Urge control is an approach to changing patterns that lead to drug or alcohol use.
</p>.<p>Friends and family members of alcoholic individuals have often developed a codependent relationship with the substance abuser.  Specifically, they often feel compelled to either help their loved one secure alcohol or to repair situations caused by the alcoholic's alcohol use.  Social control involves family members and other significant others of the alcoholic in treatment.</p>.<p>For people in the first stage of alcohol use (having access but not having yet used alcohol), preventive measures are used. Therefore, limiting access to alcohol or other drugs, addressing any risk factors of the alcohol consumer or family, as well as optimal parental supervision for youth and expression regarding expectations are often recommended. The approach to those who have experimented with alcohol should not be minimized by mental-health professionals, since infrequent use can progress to the more serious stages of alcohol use if not addressed. Therefore, professionals recommend that the alcohol-consuming individual be thoroughly educated about the effects and risks of alcohol, that fair but firm limits be set on the use of alcohol, and that the user be referred for brief counseling, a self-help group, and/or family support group. People who have progressed to the more advanced stages of alcoholism are typically treated intensively, using a combination of the medical, individual, and familial interventions already described.</p>.<p>While group therapy can help teens stay sober, groups that include a number of teens who also engage in disordered behaviors can actually tend to increased alcohol use in this age group.  Family interventions for alcoholism that tend to be effective for teens include multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), group therapy, and multifamily educational intervention (MFE). MDFT 
has been found to be quite effective. Longer-term residential treatment, often 
called rehab, of three to five months that addresses peer relationships, 
educational problems, and family issues is often used in treating alcohol use 
disorder in teens.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_medications__treat_alcohol_use_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are few medications that are considered effective in treating moderate to severe alcohol use disorder. 
Naltrexone (Trexan, Revia, or Vivitrol) has been found effective in managing this illness. It is the most frequently used medication in treating alcohol use disorder . It decreases the alcoholic's cravings for alcohol by blocking the body's euphoric ("high") response to it. Naltrexone is either taken by mouth on a daily basis or through monthly injections.
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/disulfiram-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Disulfiram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/disulfiram-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Antabuse</a>) is prescribed for about 9% of alcoholics. It decreases the alcoholic's craving for the substance by producing a negative reaction to drinking. 
Acamprosate (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acamprosate_calcium_delayed-release_tablet/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Campral</a>) works by decreasing cravings for alcohol in those who have stopped drinking.

None of these medications have been specifically approved to treat alcoholism in people less than 18 years of age. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/baclofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Baclofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/baclofen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lioresal</a>) has been found to be a potentially effective treatment to decrease alcohol cravings and withdrawal symptoms.

Other warning signs of alcohol use disorder include losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, having blackouts because of heavy drinking, and getting annoyed when loved ones say you may have a drinking problem. Behaviors that may indicate that a person is suffering from alcoholism include being able to drink more and more alcohol, trouble stopping once you start drinking, powerful urges to drink, and having withdrawal symptoms like nervousness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, shaking, or having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> sweats, and even hallucinations when you don't have a drink.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_an_alcoholic_just_cut_back_or_stop_drinking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>While some people with alcohol use disorder can cut back or stop drinking without help, most are only able to do so temporarily unless they get treatment.  Individuals who consume alcohol in lower amounts and tend to cope with problems more directly are more likely to be successful in their efforts to cut back or stop drinking without the benefit of treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_safe_level_of_drinking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recent research describes potential health benefits of consuming alcohol,

The long-term effects of alcohol use disorder can be devastating and even life-threatening. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can negatively affect virtually every organ system. Specific examples of alcohol-use disorder effects on the body include everything from general effects like poor coordination, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thiamine-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thiamine</a> deficiency, and other forms of poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nutrition</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cardiovascular</a> effects like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> and irregular heartbeat, reproductive effects like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impotence</a> and irregular menses, as well as gastrointestinal problems like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">jaundice</a>, cirrhosis of the liver, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pancreatitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pancreatitis</a>.

Approximately 10%-15% of people with alcoholism tend to commit <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">suicide</a>. 
Intoxication is associated with suicide attempts using more lethal methods, and 
positive blood-alcohol levels are often found in people who complete suicide.  Men who have lost their spouses within the year are at highest risk of suicide.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_codependency_and_what_is_the_treatment_for_codependency" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Codependency is the tendency to interact with another person in an excessively 
passive or caretaking manner that negatively affects the quality of the 
codependent individual's life. The codependent person has a pattern of putting 
their own needs below those of others, likely has low self-esteem, and tends to 
engage in denial, excessive compliance, and control.  Individuals who are codependent are at risk for engaging in addictive behaviors, including alcoholism, drug or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_addiction/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sexual addiction</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eating_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eating disorders</a> or self-destructive or

Clear communication by parents about the negative effects of alcohol, as well as 
about their expectations regarding drug use, has been found to significantly 
decrease alcohol use in teens. Adequate parental supervision has also been found 
to be a deterrent to underage alcohol abuse. Alcohol, and other drug use, has 
been found to occur most often between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., immediately 
after school and prior to parents' arrival at home from work. Teen participation 
in extracurricular activities has therefore been revealed to be an important 
prevention measure for the use of alcohol in this age group. Parents can also 
help educate teens about appropriate coping and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>-management strategies. 
For example, 15- to 16-year-olds who use religion to cope with stress tend to 
use drugs significantly less often and have fewer problems as a result of 
drinking than their peers who do not use religion to cope.
</p>.<p>
Factors for preventing alcohol use disorder in older teenagers and young adults include limiting the availability of alcohol and enforcing rules that address issues like drinking and driving.  Specific examples of limiting the accessibility of alcohol might involve raising the cost of alcohol and restricting when and where alcohol can be consumed.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_alcohol__use_disorder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
With treatment, about 70% of people with alcoholism are able to decrease the number of days they consume alcohol and improve their overall health status within six months. On the other hand, most individuals who have been treated for a moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder have relapsed at least once during the first year after treatment. Those individuals seem to drink less often and lower amounts after receiving treatment compared with before treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
