<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">Abdominal pain</a> is felt in the abdomen. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diaphragm</a> above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (such as the skin and muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe discomfort originating from organs within the abdominal cavity. Organs of the abdomen include the stomach, small intestine, colon, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas.</p>.<p>Technically, the lowermost portion of the area described previously, is the pelvis, which contains the urinary bladder and rectum, as well as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">prostate gland</a> in men, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries in women. Often, it can be difficult to know if lower abdominal pain is coming from the lower abdomen or pelvis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_pain_in_women_and_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pelvic pain</a>).</p>.<p>Occasionally, pain may be felt in the belly even though it is arising from organs that are close to, but not within, the abdominal cavity, for example, conditions of the lower <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. On the other hand, it also is possible for pain from organs within the belly to be felt outside of the it. For example, the pain of pancreatic inflammation may be felt in the back. These latter types of pain are described as "referred” because it does not originate in the location that it is felt. Rather, the cause is located away from where it is felt (i.e., it is referred to a different area).</p>.<p>Picture of the organs and glands in the abdomen.</p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG--></p>.<p></p>.<p>Abdominal pain is caused by inflammation of an organ (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">appendicitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diverticulosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diverticulitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">colitis</a>), by stretching or distention of an organ (for example, obstruction of the intestine, blockage of a bile duct by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gallstones/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gallstones</a>, swelling of the liver with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis</a>), or by loss of the supply of blood to an organ (for example, ischemic colitis).</p>.<p>To complicate matters, however, abdominal pain also can occur without inflammation, distention or loss of blood supply. An important example of the latter is the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibs_pictures_slideshow_understanding_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">irritable bowel syndrome</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibs_pictures_slideshow_understanding_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">IBS</a>). It is not clear what causes the belly pain in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">IBS</a>, but it is believed to be due either to abnormal contractions of the intestinal muscles (for example, spasm) or abnormally sensitive nerves within the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">intestines</a> that give rise to painful sensations inappropriately (visceral hyper-sensitivity). This often is referred to as functional pain because no recognizable specific abnormality to account for the cause of the pain has been found - at least not yet.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Doctors will ask you a variety of questions about your belly pain in order to help find the possible causes of it, for example:</p>.<p>Doctors determine the cause of the pain by relying on:</p>.<p>Examining the patient will provide the doctor with additional clues to the cause of the pain. The doctor will determine:</p>.<p>For example:</p>.<p>While the health history and physical examination are vitally important in determining the cause of abdominal pain, other medical tests often are necessary to determine the cause.</p>.<p>Laboratory tests such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">complete blood count</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_blood_tests/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">liver enzymes</a>, pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_test/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">pregnancy test</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinalysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">urinalysis</a> are frequently ordered.</p>.<p>Plain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/x-rays/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">X-rays</a> of the abdomen also are referred to as a KUB (because they include the kidney, ureter, and bladder). The KUB may show enlarged loops of intestines filled with copious amounts of fluid and air when there is intestinal obstruction. Patients with a perforated ulcer may have air escape from the stomach into the abdominal cavity. The escaped air often can be seen on a KUB on the underside of the diaphragm. Sometimes a KUB may reveal a calcified <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney stone</a> that has passed into the ureter and resulted in referred abdominal pain or calcifications in the pancreas that suggest <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pancreatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic pancreatitis</a>.</p>.<p><strong>Surgery</strong>. Sometimes, diagnosis requires examination of the abdominal cavity either by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/laparoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">laparoscopy</a> or surgery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>As previously mentioned, the discomfort of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">irritable bowel</a> syndrome is due either to abnormal intestinal muscle contractions or visceral hypersensitivity. Generally, abnormal muscle contractions and visceral hypersensitivity are much more difficult to diagnose than other diseases or other health conditions, particularly since there are no typical abnormalities on physical examination or the usual diagnostic tests. The diagnosis is based on the history (typical symptoms) and the absence of other cause.</p>.<p>If you aren’t sure if you need to seek medical advice for belly pain, contact your doctor or other health care professional before using any home remedies.</p>.<p>Common home remedies and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) medicines include:</p>.<p>Some health care professionals recommend:</p>.<p>Some of these may help reduce symptoms, but if symptoms persist, seek medical care. Beware of "cures" advertised as a single treatment that can cure all causes of this problem because no such remedy or cure exists.</p>.<p>Taking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">NSAIDs</a> should be avoided until the cause of the pain is diagnosed because the medications could make some causes worse (for example, peptic ulcers, intestinal bleeding).</p>.<p>Modern advances in technology have greatly improved the accuracy, speed, and ease of establishing the cause of belly pain, but significant challenges remain. There are many reasons why diagnosing the cause of it can be difficult.</p>.<p>Medications that are used for the treatment of underlying cause(s) of the pain are the medications of choice. For example, medications are not needed for the treatment of simple viral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroenteritis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stomach flu</a> or stomach bug), while surgery and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> may be the best approach to treat certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancers</a> in the abdomen. Other causes may require antispasmodics, antimicrobials, H2 blockers, or even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitrates-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nitrates</a> or morphine. The diagnosed cause usually narrows the choice of medications. A few causes can only be treated by surgery (for example incarcerated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hernia_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hernia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal adhesions</a> from previous surgeries, and certain abdominal injuries), although some medications may be used (for example, morphine) while the person is waiting to have surgery.</p>.<p>Lifestyle changes really depend on the cause of the pain.</p>.<p>Some doctors suggest that if you have a "less serious" cause of abdominal pain you likely won’t need to see a doctor if the symptoms resolve in about 24 to 48 hours. For example, if you have viral or bacterial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">food poisoning</a>, have had discomfort, but aren’t dehydrated.</p>.<p>If you have a chronic problem that occasionally causes abdominal discomfort, most doctors suggest you contact the person treating you for the ailment for an appointment or prescription (refill). However, if you have any of the problems or symptoms listed in the "serious abdominal pain "section above, you should seek immediate medical care.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
