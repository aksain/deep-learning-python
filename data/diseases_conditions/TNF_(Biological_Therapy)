<p><b><a name="what_is_biological_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Biological or biologic therapy is treatment designed to stimulate or restore the ability of the body's immune (natural internal defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is also called biotherapy or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy_shots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">immunotherapy</a> and is commonly used to treat different kinds of cancers, as well as other conditions.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_biological_therapy_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Biological therapy is a form of treatment that uses portions of the body's natural immune system to treat a disease. Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.</p>.<p>Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> and other diseases, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Crohn's disease</a>.</p>.<p>Biological therapy may also target specific molecules on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> cells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">cancer</a> cells.</p>.<p>Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_examples_of_biological_therapies" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Monoclonal antibodies, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interferon/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">interferon</a>, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM- CSF, G-CSF) are forms of biological therapy. For example, interleukin-2 and interferon are two examples of BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/malignant_melanoma_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">malignant melanoma</a>.</p>.<p>Monoclonal antibodies are a common type of biological therapy for many different cancers and other conditions. These are laboratory-produced antibodies that are designed to attack specific proteins expressed by abnormal cells. Examples of monoclonal antibody <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rituximab/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">rituximab</a>, which is used to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/non-hodgkins_lymphomas/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">non-Hodgkin's <span class="CrossLinkHighLight">lymphoma</span></a>, alemtuzumab (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alemtuzumab-injectable/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Campath</a>) to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a> (CLL), and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for metastatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">melanoma</a>.</p>.<p>Other kinds of monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers target proteins that are responsible for cell growth.
