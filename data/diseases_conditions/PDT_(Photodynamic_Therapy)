<p><b><a name="what_is_photodynamic_therapy_pdt" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical treatment that utilizes a photosensitizing molecule (frequently a drug that becomes activated by light exposure) and a light source to activate the administered drug. Very thin superficial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin <span class="CrossLinkHighLight">cancers</span></a> called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/actinic_keratosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">actinic keratoses</a> and certain other types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> cells can be eliminated this way. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Acne</a> can also be treated as well. The procedure is easily performed in a physician's office or outpatient setting. PDT is also referred to as blue light therapy.</p>.<p>PDT essentially has three steps. First, a light-sensitizing liquid, cream, or intravenous drug (photosensitizer) is applied or administered. Occasionally, a photosensitizing molecule that is already part of the body can be activated. Second, there is an incubation period of minutes to days. Finally, the target tissue is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light that then activates the photosensitizing medication. The mechanism by which tissue is destroyed seems to depend on the presence of activated oxygen molecules.</p>.<p>Steps:</p>.<p>Although first used in the early 1900s, PDT in the modern sense is a new, evolving science. Current PDT involves a variety of incubation times for different the light-sensitizing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> and a variety of light sources depending on the target tissue. The basic premise of PDT is selective tissue destruction.</p>.<p>At present, the primary limitation of available PDT technology for skin is the depth of penetration of the light and ability to target cells within 1/3 of an inch (approximately 1 cm) of the light source. Therefore, tumors or atypical growths must be close to the surface of the skin for PDT to work.</p>.<p>PDT is currently used in a number of medical fields, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">oncology</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a>), dermatology (skin), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic_surgery_cosmetic_surgery/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">cosmetic surgery</a>, ophthalmology, and oral medicine.</p>.<p>In oncology, PDT is FDA approved for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">non-small cell lung cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esophageal_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">esophageal cancer</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">precancerous</a> changes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barretts_esophagus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Barrett's <span class="CrossLinkHighLight">esophagus</span></a>.

More drugs may become available in the near future. Photofrin is used intravenously for internal cancers while Levulan and Metvix are applied topically for skin therapy.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_light_sources_are_available_and_how_are_they_applied" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>PDT light sources include laser light, intense pulsed light, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), blue light, red light, and many other visible lights (including natural sunlight). Photosensitizer drugs may become activated by one or several types of light. The optimal light source depends on the ideal wavelength for the particular drug used and target tissue.</p>.<p>The light source needs to be directly applied to the target tissue for an appropriate amount of time. For surface skin treatments, the light is directly applied to the area of the skin where the photosensitizer drug has been applied (such as face, scalp, arms, etc.). For internal cancers, delivering the light to the desired area is more challenging. The light may be delivered through small fiber-optic cables into the body cavity or area being treated. Sometimes, endoscopes (a thin, lighted, elongated tube that is inserted into a body space) are used to deliver the light into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, stomach, or bladder.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_photodynamic_therapy_work" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>PDT works by direct injury to the target cells and tissues. This involves the production of an activated oxygen molecule that can injure or destroy nearby cells. Because the normal skin barrier is not present at the sites of the actinic keratoses, photosensitizing molecule is preferentially absorbed there and then activated by light. The activated oxygen destroys the adjacent abnormal tissue. Once the areas have healed following PDT, the areas are reexamined to see if additional treatments or biopsies are needed.</p>.<p>With traditional cryosurgery (freezing with liquid nitrogen), only the visible actinic keratoses can be treated. Since many actinic keratoses are often not evident, PDT might be preferable since it presumably would destroy these "subclinical" lesions. PDT allows for treatment of an entire area of sun damage simultaneously, but subsequent treatments may be necessary.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="does_pdt_make_me_permanently_more_sensitive_to_light" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No, PDT causes a temporary sensitivity to light, including natural sunlight and some indoor lights. The light sensitivity resolves with time, depending on both the photosensitizer drug and dosage used.</p>.<p>Light avoidance is generally required after PDT. The duration depends on the drug and dosage used. Intravenous porphyrin may make the body, including the skin and eyes, sensitive to light for about six weeks after treatment. Proper protection, including long sleeves and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eyeglasses_sunglasses_and_magnifiers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunglasses</a>, may be required. Topically applied aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate may cause skin sensitivity only on the treatment areas for approximately 24-72 hours. These do not usually cause sensitivity on other body parts other than where the drug was directly applied. Your physician will need to discuss with you the required sun- and light-avoidance period required after your particular treatment.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_pdt_used_to_treat_the_skin" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>PDT using Levulan and a proprietary blue light is currently FDA approved for the treatment of early skin precancers called actinic keratoses (rough scaly spots generally on sun-exposed skin). PDT is also known as "ALA/PDT treatment" or "Super Blue Light." It has been referred to as a "super photo facial" when the photosensitizer is used with a machine called intense pulsed light or IPL. These treatments may help remove sun-damaged precancerous skin. Sun damage, fine lines, and blotchy pigmentation may also be improved because of the positive effect of PDT. PDT seems to reduce oil gland function and so is helpful in treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">acne</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/rosacea_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">rosacea</a>.</p>.<p>Although PDT's use in skin was first investigated in 1990s for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/actinic_keratosis_solar_keratosis_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">actinic keratosis</a>, it was not as popular or widely used because of the required long incubation times (usually 18-24 hours) and limited indications. Since approximately 2001, PDT has become more widespread primarily because of advances including shorter incubation times (30-60 minutes). In Europe, studies utilizing the exposure to ambient sunlight after application of the photosensitizer and a chemical sunblock (to prevent exposure to ultraviolet light) seemed to be effective in the treatment of actinic keratoses. This could eliminate the need for treatment to be administered in a physician's office.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_typical_skin_pdt_session_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may be given a written procedure consent form to read and sign before your first treatment. The medical staff may take some pretreatment photography prior to applying the photosensitizer medication.</p>.<p>In the treatment room, you may be sitting or comfortably lying back on a table. Often a thorough cleansing of the face is done using alcohol and or acetone to degrease the skin.</p>.<p>The photosensitizer liquid or cream is applied topically to the whole area being treated (such as the entire face, scalp, back of the hands, back part of the forearms, legs, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>, scalp, chest, or back).</p>.<p>The medication is allowed to air dry for a few minutes, and then you will wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes for the incubation time. Some areas such as chest, back, and particularly forearms and legs require longer incubation times of two to 18 hours, depending on skin pigmentation and anatomical site. PDT requires physician adjustments for specific individualized incubation times and treatment durations.</p>.<p>After the proper incubation time, you are exposed to the light source. There may be sensations of warmth, tingling, heat, or burning in some patients. A fan can be used to help cool off during the treatment. The treatment area is then washed off and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sun_protection_and_sunscreens/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunscreen</a> applied.

On average, a series of two to three treatments are performed. It is not always possible to predict ahead of time how many treatments your specific condition may take or how you will respond to PDT.</p>.<p>After photodynamic sun avoidance for 24-48 hours is necessary.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_have_photodynamic_therapy_and_who_performs_the_procedure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Photodynamic therapy for skin disease is usually comfortably performed in an outpatient setting like a doctor's office and without any sedation or anesthesia.

PDT generally decreases the likelihood of lighter or darker skin spots (post-inflammatory hyper- or hypopigmentation) caused by routine freezing with liquid nitrogen. Additionally, PDT frequently may facilitate smoother skin and an overall improved appearance, tone, color, and enhanced skin texture.</p>.<p>In several studies, PDT has been preferred by many patients for ease of use and rapid recovery as compared to alternative treatments including freezing and topical fluorouracil (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluorouracil-topical-carac-efudex-fluoroplex/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Efudex</a>). The PDT side effects may be milder with less downtime than with fluorouracil.</p>.<p>For patients with many skin lesions, PDT may be generally more effective than repeated spot treatment with topical liquid nitrogen. Some patients are unable to tolerate the prolonged treatment required with fluorouracil or imiquimod (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/imiquimod-topical/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Aldara</a>) because of the irritation, redness, and possible downtime with these topical creams. PDT is very well-tolerated, noninvasive (no needles or surgery required) procedure to help reduce sun damage and enhance the overall cosmetic outcome (particularly in sensitive areas of the face and chest).</p>.<p><b><a name="am_i_a_good_candidate_for_photodynamic_therapy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best candidates for PDT may be those with lighter or fair skin with sun damage.</p>.<p>You may not be a good candidate for photodynamic therapy if you have darker skin that tends to turn brown or discolor with certain light or laser treatments. You may also not be a good candidate for PDT if you are very sensitive to light, burn extremely easily, would be unable to stay out of sunlight for the required 24-48 hours, or are taking medications which may make you very sensitive to sunlight or light-based therapies. People with certain medical diseases (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>) may not be candidates for PDT because of increased risk of burning from the light exposure.</p>.<p>Your decision on the best treatment choice may depend on different factors such as the location and type of skin lesions, your past treatments, your overall health, and level of comfort. Your physician can help you sort through the different treatments.</p>.<p>Your physician needs to know of any other medical conditions that may affect your procedure or overall <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">wound</a> healing.

No two individuals are exactly the same, and individual reactions and tolerance to discomfort levels vary. Most patients report mild skin irritation including minimal to mild dryness and tight feeling of their skin after PDT. This discomfort is usually improved with frequent application of bland topical emollients or plain Vaseline.</p>.<p>A small number of patients may actually complain that they felt nothing and didn't have any pain or peeling. Less commonly, a small percentage of patients for various reasons may have significant pain, a very exaggerated sunburn response, moderate overall discomfort, and pain from the tightness and warmth of the skin.</p>.<p>If there is pain, many patients find that they prefer to take something for pain at the first hint of discomfort instead of waiting until the pain builds up to an unbearable level.

Applying cool packs or ice every five to 15 minutes every hour for the first eight to 24 hours after your procedure may be very soothing.

Some skin actinic keratoses are more aggressive than others and need additional treatment and closer follow-up.</p>.<p>Sun-damaged skin frequently needs follow-up and possible further treatment. Several studies have shown that photodynamic therapy tends to have a cure rate comparable to the traditional treatment with fluorouracil (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluorouracil-topical-carac-efudex-fluoroplex/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Carac</a>, Efudex, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluorouracil-topical-carac-efudex-fluoroplex/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Fluoroplex</a>).</p>.<p>It is important to note that PDT is not curative in invasive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin cancer</a>.
