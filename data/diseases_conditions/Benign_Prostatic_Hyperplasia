It lies below the bladder (where urine is stored) and surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder). The prostate makes a fluid that helps to nourish sperm as part of the semen (ejaculatory fluid).</p>.<p>Prostate problems are common in men 50 and older. Most can be treated successfully without harming sexual function.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_bph" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is nonmalignant (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate gland, a common occurrence in older men. It is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia and abbreviated as BPH. It's also referred to as and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_prostate_bph_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">enlarged prostate</a> gland.</p>.<p><b><a name="at_what_age_do_men_develop_the_condition" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>BPH generally begins in a man's 30s, evolves slowly, and most commonly only causes symptoms after 50.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_the_condition__are_there_any_risk_factors" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>BPH is extremely common. Advanced age is a risk factor for an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_prostate_bph_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">enlarged prostate</a>. Half of all men over 50 develop symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, but only 10% need medical or surgical intervention.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_in_bph_what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In benign prostatic hyperplasia, the prostate gland grows in size. It may compress the urethra which courses through the center of the prostate. This can impede the flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra to the outside. It can cause urine to back up in the bladder (retention) leading to the need to urinate frequently during the day and night.</p>.<p>Other common symptoms include a slow flow of urine, the need to urinate urgently and difficulty starting the urinary stream. More serious problems include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infections</a> and complete blockage of the urethra, which may be a medical emergency and can lead injury to the kidneys.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_bph_a_type_of_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>No! BPH is completely benign. It is <u>not</u> a precursor (a forerunner) to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostate cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_procedures_or_tests_diagnose_this_prostate_problem" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A doctor or other health care professional usually can detect an enlarged prostate by rectal examination. The doctor also may examine the urethra, prostate, and bladder using a cytoscope, an instrument that is inserted through the penis or with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_specialties_of_doctors_treat_the_problem" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A urologist is a specialist in diseases of the urinary system, including diagnosing and treating problems of the prostate gland.</p>.<p></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_natural_or_home_remedies_to_treat_bph_or_enlarged_prostate" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Watchful waiting often is chosen by men who are not bothered by symptoms of BPH. They have no treatment except to get regular checkups and wait to see whether or not the condition gets worse.

Among these benign disorders of the prostate are acute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostatitis_inflammation_of_the_prostate_gland/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostatitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostatitis_inflammation_of_the_prostate_gland/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic prostatitis</a>.</p>.<p>Acute prostatitis is a bacterial infection of the prostate. It can occur in men at any age. Symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chills</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> in the lower back and between the legs. This problem also can make it hard or painful to urinate. Doctors prescribe antibiotic medicines for acute prostatitis and recommend that the patient drink more liquids. Treatment is usually successful.</p>.<p>Chronic prostatitis is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostatitis_inflammation_of_the_prostate_gland/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostate inflammation</a> that tends to recur over time.

Chronic prostatitis is difficult to treat, and the exact cause is not well understood.
