It can produce a very intense itch and is associated with a red or pink rash involving the groin folds and genitals. Jock itch is primarily a skin condition in men because of anatomic structures unique to males, the male genitalia.</p>.<p>The symptoms and signs of jock itch may come and go, and many cases of jock itch resolve spontaneously without any treatment. Jock itch is primarily seen in the groin, although it may spread to the inner thighs, genitals (including penis, scrotum, labia, and vaginal opening), and anus. Jock itch causes a red or pink rash on the sides of the groin folds. There may be a dry, scaly, well-demarcated rash or a collection of small, pinpoint red or pink <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a> at each <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">hair follicle</a>. This form of eruption is often called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ringworm</a> because of its well-defined red edge with central clearing. The medical term for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">ringworm</a> of the groin is <i>tinea cruris</i>, and it is caused by a fungal infection.</p>.<p>While jock itch is frequently noted in otherwise healthy people, those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">obesity</a> are more susceptible. Possible causes include irritation from tight or abrasive underwear, excess moisture, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a>, skin rubbing or friction, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic</a> problems, fungal infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yeast_infection_in_women_and_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt"><i>Candida</i> (yeast) infection</a>, and bacterial overgrowth.</p>.<p>Treatment of fungal-related jock itch may include one or a combination of antifungal creams and, rarely, antifungal pills. Treatment of jock itch that is not caused by fungus involves proper groin hygiene, keeping the area clean and dry, and washing frequently with gentle soap and water (especially after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sweating_perspiration_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">sweating</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Causes of jock itch include the following:</p>.<p>Generally, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">diet</a> does not seem to affect jock itch.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jock itch is most common in adult and middle-aged men.

Sometimes, there is central clearing as the redness of the rash spreads outward to the thighs. The itching and rash can spread to the genitals, including the labia, vagina, scrotum, penis, and anus.</p>.<p>Women may also develop vaginal white discharge and yeast infections. Men may develop infections on the head of the penis, especially if they are not circumcised.</p>.<p>Severe cases may be very uncomfortable and develop secondary complications such as breaks in the skin, open sores, ulcers, and rarely <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cellulitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cellulitis</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_jock_itch_affect_the_entire_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Jock itch does not affect the entire body.

The same fungus that causes athlete's foot in a person may actually spread to the groin in some cases.

Spread of the fungus usually occurs when fungal particles pass onto the crotch while putting on underwear. Any foot infection must be treated in order to avoid recurrence of the jock itch.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of jock itch is usually based on the symptoms and skin appearance. A microscopic examination of skin scrapings covered in a drop of potassium hydroxide will confirm a fungal cause of jock itch. Occasionally, a fungal culture of the skin scrapings may be necessary. Certain bacteria can produce an eruption in the groin indistinguishable from a fungal infection. An examination with a special ultraviolet light, a Wood's light, will enable identification.</p>.<p>Occasionally, a small <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_biopsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">skin biopsy</a> may be used to help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, a skin biopsy (surgically taking a small piece of skin using local numbing medicine) that is examined under a microscope may be necessary in atypical or widespread cases. Sometimes skin biopsies help to exclude other possible diagnoses. A skin swab or culture may be taken and sent to the lab to detect an infectious cause of the jock itch. A bacterial culture may be useful to detect bacteria, such as <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Staphylococcus</a></i>.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_jock_itch_curable_is_jock_itch_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most cases of jock itch are easily and fully curable. There are very uncommon, long-standing cases of jock itch that may not be cured. Often these more resistant cases may be controlled with proper treatment and medication. Jock itch sometimes clears completely by itself without treatment.</p>.<p>Although most cases of jock itch are not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a>, cases caused by an infection may be transmitted through skin or sexual contact, sharing of swimwear, or towels.

Since the two primary causes of jock itch are excess moisture and fungal infections, treatment depends on the exact cause of the jock itch. Treatment of jock itch associated with skin irritation and excess moisture should address general measures to keep the groin clean and dry along with the use of zinc oxide ointment. Treatment of fungal jock itch should include antifungal creams used continuously for two to four weeks. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clotrimazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Clotrimazole</a> cream is an effective treatment for both dermatophyte molds and <i>Candida</i> (yeast) and can be purchased without a prescription.</p>.<p>It is important to keep in mind that no therapy is uniformly effective in all people.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_home_remedy_can_i_use_for_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Home remedy for mild jock itch includes the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_holistic_jock_itch_treatments_are_available" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Holistic (nonmedicated) home remedy options for jock itch include</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_treat_fungal_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mild fungal or yeast jock itch may be treated by</p>.<p>Moderate fungal or yeast jock itch is often treated by a combination of</p>.<p>Severe fungal or yeast jock itch is typically treated by a combination of</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_treat_bacterial_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mild bacterial jock itch may be treated with</p>.<p>Moderate bacterial jock itch may be treated with</p>.<p>Severe bacterial jock itch may be treated with</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_itching_from_jock_itch_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Assuming the condition is not caused by an infectious agent, itching from jock itch can be treated with a short course of one of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_best_drug_for_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Overall, the best jock-itch drug is a topical antifungal cream like miconazole, clotrimazole, or terbinafine, assuming the condition is produced by a fungus. If the jock itch does not improve within two to three weeks of treatment, then a physician should be consulted. The use of the topical antifungal should be suspended for two weeks prior to seeing the physician.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_my_groin_still_discolored" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Residual skin discoloration in the groin may persist for weeks to months after more severe forms of jock itch clear.

Eventually, the skin discoloration will return to a more natural color.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_possible_complications_of_jock_itch" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications are infrequent since jock itch is usually a self-limited skin condition. Rarely, the rash may spread past the groin onto the thighs and genitals. Secondary skin infections from scratching or rubbing can uncommonly deepen, causing cellulitis or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">abscess</a> formation.</p>.<p>Another potential complication includes temporary skin discoloration called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (lighter than the regular skin color) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/phytophotodermatitis_hyperpigmentation_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">hyperpigmentation</a> (darker then the regular skin color).
