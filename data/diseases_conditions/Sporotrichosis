The fungus lives throughout the world in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. Cutaneous (skin) infection is the most common form of infection, although pulmonary infection can occur if a person inhales the microscopic, airborne fungal spores. Most cases of sporotrichosis are sporadic and are associated with minor skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scrapes</a>; however, outbreaks have been linked to activities that involve handling contaminated vegetation such as moss, hay, or wood.</p>.<p><b><a name="symptoms_of_sporotrichosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The first symptom is usually a small painless nodule (bump) resembling an insect bite. The first nodule may appear any time from 1 to 12 weeks after exposure to the fungus. The nodule can be red, pink, or purple in color, and it usually appears on the finger, hand, or arm where the fungus has entered through a break in the skin. The nodule will eventually become larger in size and may look like an open sore or ulcer that is very slow to heal. Additional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bumps</a> or nodules may appear later near the original lesion.</p>.<p>Most <i>Sporothrix</i> infections only involve the skin. However, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the bones, joints, and the central nervous system. Usually, these types of disseminated infections only occur in people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>-like illness can occur after inhaling <i>Sporothrix</i> spores, which can cause symptoms such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">shortness of breath</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>.</p>.<p>If you think you have sporotrichosis, you should see a healthcare provider.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_gets_sporotrichosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>People who handle thorny plants, sphagnum moss, or bales of hay are at increased risk of getting sporotrichosis. The infection is more common among people with weakened immune systems, but it can also occur in otherwise healthy people. Outbreaks have occurred among florists, plant nursery workers who have handled sphagnum moss, rose gardeners, children who have played on bales of hay, and greenhouse workers who have handled thorns contaminated by the fungus.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_prevent_sporotrichosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no vaccine to prevent sporotrichosis. You can reduce your risk of sporotrichosis by wearing protective clothing such as gloves and long sleeves when handling wires, rose bushes, bales of hay, pine seedlings, or other materials that may cause minor cuts or punctures in the skin. It is also advisable to avoid skin contact with sphagnum moss.</p>.<p><b><a name="sources" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The fungus lives in sphagnum moss, hay, other plant materials, and soil. The fungus can enter the skin through small cuts or punctures from thorns, barbs, pine needles, or wires. In rare cases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inhalation</a> of the fungus can cause pulmonary infection. Sporotrichosis is not spread from person to person; however, a small number of human cases have been caused by scratches or bites from infected animals such as cats.</p>.<p><b><a name="diagnosis_and_testing" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sporotrichosis is typically diagnosed when your doctor obtains a swab or a biopsy of the infected site and sends the sample to a laboratory for a fungal culture. Serological tests are not always useful in the diagnosis of sporotrichosis due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_and_outcomes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most cases of sporotrichosis only involve the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues and are non-life-threatening, but the infection requires treatment with prescription antifungal medication for several months. The most common treatment for this type of sporotrichosis is oral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itraconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">itraconazole</a> for 3 to 6 months. Itraconazole may also be used to treat bone and joint infections, but treatment should continue for at least 12 months.</p>.<p>For patients with severe disease, and/ or an infection that has spread throughout the body, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">lipid</a> formulation of amphotericin B should be used. Itraconazole can be used for step-down therapy once the patient has stabilized. Supersaturated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/potassium_iodide-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">potassium iodide</a> (SSKI) is another treatment option for cutaneous or lymphocutaneous disease. SSKI and azole <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> like itraconazole should not be used during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>. Treatment recommendations may differ for children.</p>.<p><b><a name="statistics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact incidence of sporotrichosis is unknown, but people at increased risk for sporotrichosis usually have occupational or recreational exposures related to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or gardening.</p>.<p><i>Sporothrix schenckii</i> can be found throughout the world in soil and plant matter. Peru is suspected to be an area where <i>S. schenckii</i> is extremely common in the environment. Outbreaks of sporotrichosis have been documented in the United States, Western Australia, and Brazil.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
