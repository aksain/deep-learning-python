quit <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>! Quitting is one of the best actions you can take to improve your health. You may be concerned about gaining weight, but try not to worry about it as you quit. Focus on stopping <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a> first, and then continue to improve your health in other ways, such as reaching and maintaining a healthy weight for life.
</p>.<p><b><a name="will_i_gain_weight_if_i_stop_smoking" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Not everyone gains weight when they stop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>. Among people who do, the average <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight gain</a> is less than 10 pounds.

These include:</p>.<p><b><a name="can_i_avoid_weight_gain" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p> Physical activity and a healthy eating plan may help you control your weight. In addition, being physically active may ease withdrawal symptoms during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking cessation</a> and help reduce the chances of relapsing after quitting.</p>.<p>
While it is a good idea to be physically active and eat healthy foods as you quit smoking, try not to worry about your weight. It may be easier to quit first and focus on controlling your weight when you are smoke-free.

It may also boost your mood and help you feel more energetic. It is likely that you will be able to breathe easier during physical activity after you quit smoking.
</p>.<p>
Aim to be physically active at a moderate-intensity level (one that makes you breathe harder but does not overwork or overheat you) on most, if not all, days of the week. You can accomplish this by breaking it up into shorter sessionsâ€”it does not need to be done all at once. After you quit smoking and are ready to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lose weight</a>, you may need to increase the amount of time that you are physically active each day or increase your intensity level to achieve your <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a> goals.

</p>.<p><b><a name="consider_getting_professional_advice_about_weight_control" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>You may find it easier to control your weight with the help of a health professional. Ask your health care provider if there is a weight-management program in your area. Also, consider speaking with a registered dietitian, nutritionist, personal trainer, or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> professional about becoming physically active and adopting a healthy eating plan. You may need to contact your health insurer to make sure weight-management services are covered by your plan.</p>.<p><b><a name="will_weight_gain_hurt_my_health" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although gaining weight is not desired after you stop smoking, keep in mind that the overall health benefits of quitting outweigh the health risks of weight gain.</p>.<p>
