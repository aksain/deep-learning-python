<p><b><a name="hurricane_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_hurricanes_form" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A hurricane is an intense low-pressure weather system with winds of 74 or more miles per hour. It is a type of cyclone that generally forms in the tropics. Thunderstorms accumulate into a tropical depression which begins to rotate as it gets bigger over warm tropical water. The tropical depression grows bigger and gains strength, eventually turning into a hurricane. These storms are defined by high wind speeds, with accompanying rain, possible storm surges, flooding and tornadoes.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_hurricanes_categorized" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hurricanes are categorized according to wind speeds based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The weakest hurricanes are Category 1, defined by wind speeds starting at 74 miles per hour and storm surges of 4 to 6 feet. The scale ranges to a Category 5 where wind speeds are in excess of 155 miles per hour, and storm surges can reach 18 feet or more.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_dangerous_are_hurricanes" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>All hurricanes are dangerous. Even the lowest category hurricanes can produce flying debris, standing water hazards, and tornadoes.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_national_hurricane_centers_role" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is a division of The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that predicts, names, and tracks tropical weather systems. They issue watches and warnings during the Atlantic and northeast Pacific hurricane seasons, and make predictions on tropical weather outlooks for those areas.</p>.<p>When a tropical storm or hurricane is possible within 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center issues a watch, indicating that storm conditions may occur in the area. When a tropical storm or hurricane is expected within 36 hours, the NHC issues a warning, indicating storm conditions are expected for the area. Watches and warnings are given by The National Weather Service and on NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR).</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_hurricanes_named_and_tracked" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A tropical storm that may become a hurricane is a type of weather system that is tracked to help minimize loss of life. When wind speeds reach 39 miles per hour (tropical storm wind speed), these weather systems are named. Naming helps facilitate warning and tracking services communicate storm information to the public, and reduces confusion when there is more than one storm occurring at the same time. If the named tropical storm reaches 74 or more miles per hour, the tropical storm is reclassified as a hurricane.</p>.<p>In 1953, the National Hurricane Center originated a naming list, which is now maintained by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. The lists are alphabetical, alternating between men's and women's names. The lists rotate every 6 years. If a hurricane results in significant damage or death, the name is usually retired and not used again. A complete list of hurricane names is available at the <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');popupWarning();" target="_blank">National Weather Service National Hurricane Center</a>.</p>.<p>Hurricanes are tracked by the National Hurricane Center. There are many factors that go into tracking a hurricane, including atmospheric conditions, water temperatures, and even historical information. Computer models use this data to predict what track a storm will take. Tracking has become more precise over the years and usually predictions are relatively accurate 24 hours prior to the storm. Many computer-generated models attempt to predict a hurricane's path up to five days prior. However, beyond a day or two, these predictions become less accurate. Individuals living in an area that may be impacted by a hurricane should heed all local warnings.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_you_prepare_for_a_hurricane" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best way to prepare for a hurricane is to have a plan before hurricane season starts, so you will know what your family needs to have, where to go if you need to evacuate, and what you need to do to protect your home. Below are suggestions for your family hurricane plan and supplies.</p>.<p><b><a name="have_a_family_plan_for_a_hurricane" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The National Hurricane Center suggests having a family disaster plan that is written down and discussed with all family members before a storm approaches. Create a checklist for all the things you will need to do in the event of an approaching storm.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_supplies_do_i_need_for_a_hurricane_supply_kit" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A hurricane supply kit should be prepared in advance of the storm season, should be easily accessible in case you need to evacuate, and should contain items you will need to ride out a storm, no matter where you are.</p>.<p>The National Hurricane Center suggests the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_go_to_be_safe_during_a_hurricane" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Part of your hurricane preparedness plan should include where to go in the event you need to evacuate your home. Follow instructions of local authorities and evacuate if required. If possible, leave the area before officials issue an order to evacuate, to avoid traffic delays. Ideally, safe places are out of the storm's predicted path, in a structure certified safe against hurricane-force winds (in case the storm path shifts), and are not susceptible to the high tides and storm surges associated with hurricanes; the structure should have emergency food, water, and a backup power source available.</p>.<p>Make sure your vehicle's gas tank is filled beforehand as traffic jams are common, and in the past people have abandoned their vehicles because they ran out of gas and no available gas stations were open for business.</p>.<p>If you plan to stay in a hotel (see above requirements for safe places to stay), keep in mind those closest to your area may fill up quickly. Book ahead and leave early, before the storm begins or before the hotel assigns the booking to someone else because you were late for check-in.</p>.<p>If you plan to stay with friends or family, discuss plans ahead of time, before hurricane season starts.</p>.<p>As a last resort, go to a hurricane shelter. Remember, shelters will be crowded and are not designed for comfort. Bring your disaster kit supplies with you. Most shelters do not accept pets.</p>.<p>During a storm, it is never safe to leave a protective shelter because of the high probability of being hit by flying debris or being knocked off your feet by winds or water surges; continue to listen to the emergency radio broadcasts as they will indicate when it is safe to go outside. Although venturing outside is tempting if the storm's "eye" or center passes over (the eye contains much calmer wind conditions), the storm's furious conditions can be back in a matter of minutes as the eye moves away from your location and you could be cut off from returning to your shelter.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_secure_my_home_during_a_hurricane" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The best thing you can do to reduce damage to home and property is to protect 
areas where wind can enter. If you have hurricane shutters, install them before the storm. Never go 
outside during a storm to put up shutters. </p>.<p>Reinforce roofs, straps, shutters, doors, and garage doors. If possible, you 
can reinforce these areas when doing other home improvement or renovation. Check 
local building codes. For more information on retrofitting your home, visit

contaminate the public water supply, which can cause illness. Do not assume 
water in a hurricane-affected area is safe to drink.</p>.<p>Listen for public announcements about the safety of the municipal water 
supply. Use bottled water for eating or drinking. If you do not have bottled 
water, and are not sure that your tap water is safe, follow these directions to 
purify tap water published by the government for public information:</p>.<p>The bleach method may not kill all parasites and the filter methods must be 
followed carefully; people need to read the directions carefully to produce the 
safest possible drinking water.</p>.<p>If there is flooding along with a hurricane, local waterways may become 
polluted with waste. There is risk of disease from eating or drinking anything 
contaminated with floodwater.</p>.<p>Do not allow children to play in floodwater areas. Wash children's hands 
frequently and disinfect any toys that have come into contact with flood waters, 
using a solution of one cup of bleach in five gallons of water.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_perform_first_aid_for_injuries" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>First aid is extremely important when someone is exposed to waters

will continue to face a number of hazards associated with cleanup activities. 
Follow these guidelines to prevent injury.</p>.<p>Long hours of work, combined with exhaustion, can create a 
highly stressful 
situation during cleanup. People working on hurricane and flood cleanup can 
reduce their risks of injury and illness in several ways:</p>.<p>For most work in flooded areas, wear hard hats, goggles, heavy work gloves, 
and watertight boots with steel toe and insole (not just steel shank). </p>.<p>Wear earplugs or protective headphones to 
reduce noise induced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a> risk from equipment noise. 
Equipment such as chain saws, backhoes, and professional dryers may cause 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_in_the_ears/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ringing in the ears</a> (tinnitus) 
and subsequent hearing damage.</p>.<p>Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is poisonous to breathe. 
During flood cleanup, operate all gasoline-powered devices such as pumps, 
generators, and pressure washers outdoors and never bring them inside a building 
or home. This 
will help to ensure the safety from carbon monoxide poisoning for everyone.</p>.<p>Never assume that water-damaged structures or the ground are stable. Buildings 
that have been submerged or have withstood rushing flood waters may have 
suffered structural damage and could be dangerous. </p>.<p>Flood waters can dislodge tanks, drums, pipes, and equipment which may 
contain hazardous materials such as pesticides or propane.</p>.<p>Fire can pose a major threat to an already badly damaged flood area. Fire 
protection systems may be inoperative, the fire department response may be 
hampered and water supplies may be inoperable. </p>.<p>Make sure you have at least one working fire extinguisher in your home. 
Natural gas lines may be disrupted; leave any area that has an unusual smell, 
notify the gas and fire departments, and do not use power equipment in the area 
as any sparks could cause fire or explosions if a gas line is broken and 
leaking. </p>.<p>Use care operating a home powered generator, and always follow the manufacturer's 
instructions including operating the generator outdoors. </p>.<p>When entering moving water, you are at risk for 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drowning/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drowning</a> regardless of your 
ability to swim. Individuals in vehicles are at the greatest risk of drowning, 
so it 
is important to comply with all hazard warnings on roadways and to avoid driving 
vehicles or heavy equipment into water of an unknown depth. NIOSH recommends 
you avoid working alone and wear a Coast Guard-approved life jacket when 
working in or near flood waters.</p>.<p>Never walk into standing water after a storm, as you do not know how deep the 
water may be, or if there are active electrical lines hidden underneath. </p>.<p>While cleaning up after the hurricane, you are at risk for developing 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthermia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heat-related illness</a> from working in hot environments where hurricanes form.</p>.<p>To reduce heat-related illness risks:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_deal_with_wild_and_domestic_animals_in_a_disaster" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Be cautious of wild or stray animals. They may be disoriented and dangerous 
following a hurricane or flood. Try to confine the animal without putting 
yourself at 
risk of being bitten. Call the Animal Control agency in your county if you find 
or come across a wild or domestic animal. Rising 
water in hurricanes displace snakes which may seek the same higher drier ground 
that people, pets and other animals may occupy. Be aware of this hazard and 
avoid any reptiles.</p>.<p>Wild and domestic animals may escape or be killed in disasters. Escaped 
animals may wander onto land where they may:
</p>.<p>Decaying carcasses create biologic waste, may contaminate groundwater, cause 
foul odors, and attract flies and rodents, which can spread disease. Animal carcasses should be disposed of as soon as possible to avoid creating 
a health hazard to animals or humans. Contact your local animal control department or local health department for 
specific disposal guidance. <span id="cntid"></span></p>
