It should not be confused with foot (hoof) and mouth disease that affects cattle, sheep, and swine.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>HFMD is caused by several members of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enterovirus_non-polio_enterovirus_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enterovirus</a> family of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a>. The most common cause is Coxsackievirus A16; less frequently <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enterovirus_d68_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">enterovirus</a> 71 is the infectious agent. The clinical manifestations of routine HFMD are the same regardless of the responsible virus. However, patients infected with enterovirus 71 are more likely to experience rare complications (for example, viral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meningitis</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cardiac muscle</a> involvement).<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Risk factors for developing HFMD include</p>.<p><b><a name="is_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease_contagious_how_does_hfmd_spread" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>HFMD is spread person to person by direct contact with the infecting virus (either Coxsackievirus A16 or less commonly enterovirus 71). These viruses are most commonly found in the nasal and throat regions but also in the blister fluid or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stool</a> of infected individuals. The virus can survive on inanimate surfaces such as desktops, faucets, etc. It can then be transferred by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes before washing your hands. Likewise, changing diapers from an infected infant without wearing gloves or hand-washing can transmit disease. Water contaminated with the virus can also transmit the infection. Women who are infected shortly prior to delivery may pass on the infection to their infant. The baby will generally have a mild illness but should be monitored closely since in rare cases they could develop a more severe infection or experience complications. Infected individuals are most <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> during the first week of their illness. HFMD cannot be contracted from pets or animals.</p>.<p>The viruses that cause HFMD may remain in the person's respiratory or intestinal tract for several weeks to months after all symptoms have resolved. It is possible, therefore, to transmit the infection even though the formerly ill individual has completely recovered. Some individuals (most commonly adults) may exhibit no symptoms or signs during their infection but may unwittingly transmit the illness to those (commonly infants and children) who are not immune.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_contagious_period_for_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Once exposed to the virus, those who develop symptoms and signs will do so within one to three days. They are most contagious during the first week of the illness. However, the virus may continue to be shed for one to three weeks in respiratory secretions (saliva and/or nasal mucous) and in the stool for two to eight weeks after the primary infection.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_incubation_period_for_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>HFMD is moderately contagious and spreads from person to person. It cannot be spread by animals. Usually, the virus is passed via oral secretions (nasal discharge and saliva, etc.) or via stool. There is a short one- to three-day incubation period between exposure and development of initial symptoms (fever and malaise). A person is most contagious during the first week of illness.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_adults_get_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An adult who was never exposed to the viruses that cause HFMD as a child could develop the characteristic symptoms and physical signs (vesicular rash with the characteristic distribution) if infected by the virus. Interestingly, the majority of adults exposed to enteroviruses will remain without symptoms. Unfortunately, he is still contagious even though he lacks objective physical findings.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>HFMD is most commonly an illness of the summer and fall seasons.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_does_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease_usually_occur" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the temperate northern hemisphere, summer and fall are the most frequent seasons for community epidemics of HFMD. The illness is year-round in the tropics. While anyone exposed to the viral causes of HFMD may develop disease, not everyone infected will develop symptoms and signs.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_does_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The total duration of illness from HFMD is approximately five to seven days. One to three days after viral invasion of the patient, the first symptoms become evident. These include fever, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/decreased_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">reduced appetite</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">sore throat</a>, and a general sense of feeling ill (malaise). One to two days later, the characteristic painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mouth_sores/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">mouth sores</a> develop. The final stage of the illness is manifested by small, tender red spots which progress to blisters in the mouth, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and less frequently on the arms and legs, as well as the buttock and genital areas. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_course_of_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The illness is characteristically self-limited and is usually resolved within a week, particularly when due to its most common cause, Coxsackievirus A16. In those outbreaks due to enterovirus 71, the illness may be more severe with complications such as infection of the heart muscle and/or viral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/meningitis_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">meningitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalitis</a> and paralytic disease. As a rule, HFMD is generally a mild and self-limited illness.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="why_haven#39t_we_heard_more_about_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recognition of hand, foot, and mouth disease is relatively recent (when contrasted with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mumps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mumps</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">measles</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chickenpox</a>, for example). HFMD was first reported in 1956 in Australia. By the early 1960s, it had emerged as a common childhood illness around the world.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health_care_professionals_diagnose_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Usually, the diagnosis of HFMD is made on a combination of clinical history and characteristic physical findings. Laboratory confirmation is rarely necessary unless severe complications develop.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of HFMD is directed toward symptomatic relief of fever and sore throat. Antibiotics are not indicated in the treatment of this viral disease. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been tried as a therapy for severely ill patients or immunocompromised older patients with variable success.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_complications_of_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications of HFMD are relatively rare. The more common cause of HFMD (Coxsackievirus A16) is less likely to cause complications when compared with enterovirus-71.</p>.<p>Complications include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease_affect_pregnancy_and_the_baby" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Commonly, HFMD is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. Information regarding fetal exposure to HFMD during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> is limited. No solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">congenital defects</a>. However, should a baby be born to a mother with active HFMD symptoms and signs, the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">neonatal</a> infection is high. While such newborns often have a mild illness, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">newborn</a> infant may develop an overwhelming infection involving vital organs such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a>, heart, and brain, which could be fatal.</p>.<p><b><a name="when_can_children_with_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease_return_to_school" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Children may return to school once without fever for 24 hours (usually day three or four of the disease).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for routine HFMD is excellent. A patient's symptoms are bothersome but not debilitating. Medications designed to reduce fever and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> relievers are helpful, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">acetaminophen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tylenol</a>) or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Advil</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Motrin</a>). Young children often find that cool/soft foods (ice cream, smoothies, etc.) provide some pain relief and are psychologically helpful as "special treats." An individual assessment is required for those unique individuals who develop complications (such as meningitis). As would be anticipated, those with an immunocompromised status are more likely to develop either a more serious infection or an illness of a more intense nature than those with a normally functioning immune system.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> to prevent HFMD. Routine hygiene (soap and water washing of the hands) is a primary strategy to limit transmission of the virus. Cleaning a child's toys (especially those which would be placed into the mouth or drooled upon) is important. Avoidance of direct saliva exposure (kissing, sharing eating utensils, etc.) is also very helpful to limit transmission. Since transmission of the virus is also possible via stool, wearing disposable gloves during changing of diapers (especially in a preschool or day care setting) is also beneficial.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>
