Cunha, DO, FACOEP</p>.<p><b><a name="gallbladder_cancer_is_a_disease_in_which_malignant_cancer_cells_form_in_the_tissues_of_the_gallbladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to 
help digest fat. When food is being broken down in the stomach and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a>, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine. </p>.<p>The wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue. </p>.<p>Between these layers is supporting connective tissue. Primary gallbladder cancer starts in the innermost layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="being_female_can_increase_the_risk_of_developing_gallbladder_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer include the following: </p>.<p><b><a name="possible_signs_of_gallbladder_cancer_include_jaundice_pain_and_fever" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other symptoms may be caused by gallbladder cancer. Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur: </p>.<p><b><a name="gallbladder_cancer_is_difficult_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_early" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons: </p>.<p>Gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons. Patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gallstones/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gallstones</a> rarely develop gallbladder cancer. </p>.<p>Procedures that create pictures of the gallbladder and the area around it help diagnose gallbladder cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the gallbladder is called staging. </p>.<p>In order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the gallbladder cancer can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer are usually done at the same time. The following tests and procedures may be used: </p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_the_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: </p>.<p>Treatment may also depend on the age and general health of the patient and whether the cancer is causing symptoms. </p>.<p>Gallbladder cancer can be cured only if it is found before it has spread, when it can be removed by surgery. If the cancer has spread, palliative treatment can improve the patient's quality of life by controlling the symptoms and complications of this disease. </p>.<p>Taking part in one of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">clinical trials</a> being done to improve treatment should be considered. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. </p>.<p><b><a name="stages_of_gallbladder_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tests and procedures to stage gallbladder cancer tell the doctor the extent 
of the cancer. The testing necessary to learn if the disease is localized or not 
is usually done at the same time as diagnosis. </p>.<p>See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. </p>.<p>In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the innermost (mucosal) layer of the gallbladder. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">carcinoma in situ</a>. </p>.<p>In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB.</p>.<p>Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB. </p>.<p>In stage III, cancer has spread to a main blood vessel in the liver or to nearby organs and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. </p>.<p>In stage IV, cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and/or to organs far away from the gallbladder. </p>.<p>Cancer is found in the wall of the gallbladder and can be completely removed by surgery. </p>.<p>Cancer has spread through the wall of the gallbladder to surrounding tissues or organs or throughout the abdominal cavity. Except in patients whose cancer has spread only to lymph nodes, the cancer is unresectable (cannot be completely removed by surgery). </p>.<p>Recurrent gallbladder cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the gallbladder or in other parts of the body. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_option_overview" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are different types of treatment for patients with gallbladder cancer.</p>.<p>Different types of treatments are available for patients with gallbladder cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. </p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. </p>.<p>Gallbladder cancer may be treated with a cholecystectomy, surgery to remove the gallbladder and some of the tissues around it. Nearby lymph nodes may be removed. A laparoscope is sometimes used to guide gallbladder surgery. The laparoscope is attached to a video camera and inserted through an incision (port) in the abdomen. Surgical instruments are inserted through other ports to perform the surgery. Because there is a risk that gallbladder cancer cells may spread to these ports, tissue surrounding the port sites may also be removed.</p>.<p>If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may relieve symptoms: </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Radiation therapy</a> is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. </p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the spinal column, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. </p>.<p>Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells. </p>.<p>This summary section refers to specific treatments under study in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied.
