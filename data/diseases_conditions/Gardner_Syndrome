<p><b><a name="what_is_familial_adenomatous_polyposis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p align="left">Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder 
characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> of the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">large intestine</a> (colon) and 
rectum. People with the classic type of familial adenomatous polyposis may 
begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) 
growths (polyps) in the colon as early as their
teenage years. Unless the 
colon is removed, these polyps will become <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">malignant</a> (cancerous). The average 
age at which an individual develops <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colon cancer</a> in classic familial adenomatous 
polyposis is 39 years. Some people have a variant of the disorder, called 
attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, in which
polyp growth is delayed. The 
average age of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colorectal cancer</a> onset for attenuated familial adenomatous 
polyposis is 55 years.</p>.<p>In people with classic familial adenomatous polyposis, the number of polyps 
increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the 
colon. Also of particular significance are noncancerous growths called desmoid 
tumors. These fibrous tumors usually occur in the tissue covering the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a> 
and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. Desmoid tumors tend to recur 
after they are surgically removed. In both classic familial adenomatous 
polyposis and its attenuated variant, benign and malignant tumors are sometimes 
found in other places in the body, including the 
duodenum (a section of the 
 small intestine), 
stomach, bones, skin, and other tissues. People who have 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colon_polyps/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colon polyps</a> as well as growths outside the colon are sometimes described as 
having Gardner syndrome.</p>.<p>A milder type of familial adenomatous polyposis, called 
autosomal recessive 
familial adenomatous polyposis, has also been identified. People with the 
autosomal recessive type of this disorder have fewer polyps than those with the 
classic type. Fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or 
thousands. The autosomal recessive type of this disorder is caused by mutations 
in a different gene than the 
classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_familial_adenomatous_polyposis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The reported incidence of familial adenomatous polyposis varies from 1 in 
7,000 to 1 in 22,000 individuals.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_genes_are_related_to_familial_adenomatous_polyposis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Mutations in the APC gene cause both classic and attenuated familial 
adenomatous polyposis. These mutations affect the ability of the cell to 
maintain normal growth and function. Cell overgrowth resulting from mutations in 
the APC gene leads to the colon polyps seen in familial adenomatous polyposis. 
Although most people with mutations in the APC gene will develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colorectal</a> 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, the number of polyps and the time frame in which they become malignant 
depend on the location of the 
mutation in the gene.</p>.<p>Mutations in the MUTYH 
gene cause autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis (also called MYH-associated 
polyposis). Mutations in this gene prevent cells from correcting mistakes that 
are made when DNA is copied 
(DNA 
 replication) in preparation 
for cell division. As these mistakes build up in a person's DNA, the likelihood 
of cell overgrowth increases, leading to colon polyps and the possibility of

it is inherited in an autosomal 
dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is 
sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one 
parent with the condition.</p>.<p>When familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the MUTYH gene, 
it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of 
the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual 
with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, 
but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_information_about_treatment_for_familial_adenomatous_polyposis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These resources address the management of familial adenomatous polyposis and
