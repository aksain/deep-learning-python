<p><b><a name="chickenpox_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_chickenpox_what_causes_chickenpox" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chickenpox is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is in the herpesvirus family. These <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">viruses</a> infect many tissues during primary infection and then become dormant; they can reactivate later to cause disease. In the case of VZV, reactivation disease is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_picture_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">shingles</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">herpes zoster</a> and typically occurs when there is a weakened immune system. Before chickenpox <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccine</a> became routine in the U.S., chickenpox was a common childhood disease. Today, it still occurs in populations that are not routinely vaccinated. Varicella-zoster virus is often categorized with the other common so-called "viral exanthems" (viral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rashes</a>) such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">measles</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rubeola</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">German measles</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rubella</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fifth_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fifth disease</a> (parvovirus B19), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mumps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mumps</a> virus, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/roseola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">roseola</a> (human herpesvirus 6), but these viruses are unrelated except for their tendency to cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rashes</a>. In unimmunized populations, most people contract chickenpox by age 15, the majority between ages 5 and 9, but all ages can contract it. Chickenpox is usually more severe in adults and very young infants than children. Winter and spring are the most common times of the year for chickenpox to occur.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_chickenpox" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The risk factors for chickenpox are</p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_chickenpox_spread_what_is_the_incubation_period_and_contagious_period_for_chickenpox" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Chickenpox is very highly contagious. It is easily passed between non-immune family members and school classmates through airborne particles, droplets in exhaled air, and fluid from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blisters</a> or sores. It also can be transmitted indirectly by direct contact with articles of clothing and other items exposed to fresh fluid from open sores.</p>.<p>The infected person is contagious up to five days (most often, one to two days) before and five days after the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a> appears. It is important for the infected person to stay home away from others while blisters and moist sores are present. When all of the sores have crusted over and are dry, which usually takes about a week, the person is considered no longer contagious.</p>.<p>Because it is so contagious, a non-immune (not vaccinated) person who is exposed to chickenpox is advised to stay home and away from infants and small children or other non-immune people for 21 days after exposure. This is the incubation period before illness occurs. If the person does not become ill in 21 days, he/she may return to usual activities around others. This is very disruptive to school or work. It is not necessary for people who have been vaccinated.</p>.<p>Screening and vaccination for chickenpox is strongly recommended for those who will be working in the health care professions.</p>.<p>When a person with chickenpox must be hospitalized, he/she will be placed in a specially equipped room that vents air harmlessly to the outside environment (negative pressure room). Health care workers will wear gowns and gloves whenever in contact with the patient. These precautions are necessary to prevent non-immune staff and other patients from becoming infected by contact or by airborne virus escaping into the hallway or air handling system.</p>.<p>Varicella virus remains dormant or latent after the acute chickenpox syndrome. It may sometimes be recurrent as a limited area of blisters that look like chickenpox; this syndrome is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/shingles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">shingles</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">herpes</a> zoster. Shingles is much less contagious than chickenpox. It is not transmitted by airborne virus but rather by direct contact with blisters.</p>.<p>Chickenpox is more complicated at older ages but is usually mild in childhood. It also provides lifelong immunity. Parents have sometimes brought well children to the home of a child with chickenpox for a "chickenpox party" as a way for them to acquire lifelong protection early. This practice may make sense in very resource-poor areas of the world, but it carries the risk of complications of varicella and the long-term risk of shingles later on (which is very painful and has other potential serious complications). Where safe and effective varicella vaccine (chickenpox vaccine) is available it does not make sense to promote immunity this way.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_chickenpox_symptoms_and_signs_how_long_does_chickenpox_last" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The incubation period (the time from infection to symptoms) is about 14 to 21 days after contact with the virus. Chickenpox is characterized by general <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a> up to 102 F, and red spots that start on the same day or so as the fever. The spots rapidly develop into <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blister</a>-like skin lesions with surrounding redness. Rash usually starts on the head or trunk (the area where most of the rash appears) and spreads to the arms and legs. The blisters may spread to mucous membranes and produce ulcers inside the eyelids, mouth, throat, and genital area. Any area of skin that is irritated (by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diaper_rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diaper rash</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/poison_ivy_oak_and_sumac/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">poison ivy</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sunburn_and_sun_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunburn</a>, etc.) is likely to be hard hit by the rash. The rash is typically very <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itchy</a> (pruritic) and develops in groups of new blisters even as older blisters begin to dry up. Over five to seven days, all of the blisters dry up and become crusted, and the illness is over.</p>.<p>The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health_illnesses_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">chickenpox rash</a> is very typical, and diagnosis is usually made based on symptoms and appearance of the rash without having to do any tests. However, people with immune system problems may have an atypical case. In situations where the rash is unclear, fluid or tissue biopsy from a blister or sore can be tested for VZV DNA by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_chickenpox_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The rash of chickenpox develops in groups with raised red spots arriving first, progressing to blisters filled with clear fluid, like a drop of water on red skin. The blisters may be dimpled in the center. They may break and reform, then finally form sores before drying up as scabs or crusts. They have been described best as grouped blisters on a red base in varying stages of development; some areas may just be forming blisters, while another area may already be crusting over. The crusts will come off on their own, usually without permanent scarring. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Scars</a> may occur if sores are scratched or deep, or if bacterial infection occurs, so scratching should be minimized.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_types_of_specialists_treat_chickenpox" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Primary care providers usually manage most cases of chickenpox.

VZIG is given as one dose as soon as possible after exposure to VZV and up to 10 days afterward, or at any time during hospitalization in the case of hospitalized premature infants.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_a_vaccine_prevent_chickenpox" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Yes, it is highly effective and recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Varicella vaccine has reduced the numbers of chickenpox cases and their complications by 90%. The current aim in the U.S. and many other countries is to achieve universal (or nearly universal) immunization of children with the chickenpox vaccine (varicella vaccine). The vaccination requires only two shots, may be combined with MMR (MMRV) in one vaccine, and is very safe and effective. The first vaccination is given at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second (booster) is given at 4 to 6 years of age. Catch-up vaccination in those who missed it in early childhood can be given at any time until adulthood, as long as a total of two doses have been given at least one to two months apart.</p>.<p>If an older person has not had chickenpox, the vaccine may be given at any time, although those over 50 should receive the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zoster_vaccine_live__shingles_vaccine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">shingles vaccine</a>. There have been very few vaccine side effects. All but those with a compromised immune system should have the vaccination.</p>.<p>Unfortunately, varicella vaccine is the most commonly refused childhood vaccine; parents may still view chickenpox as the least severe vaccine-preventable disease. Prior to varicella vaccine licensure in 1995, however, there were 4 million cases of chickenpox infection annually, resulting in more than 10,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths per year in the United States. Since licensure, universal immunization has reduced by 80% the annual morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations from chickenpox.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_difference_between_varicella_vaccine_and_shingles_vaccine" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The difference between these <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> may be confusing, so they are conventionally referred to as chickenpox vaccine and shingles vaccine, to better distinguish them.</p>.<p>Varicella vaccine (also called chickenpox vaccine) is a live varicella virus strain that is formulated for nonimmune individuals. It does not cause widespread infection like wild-type varicella virus but only local infection, enough to stimulate new, protective levels of antibodies.

It may also be formulated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/measles_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">measles</a>, mumps, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/rubella_1_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">rubella</a> (MMR) vaccine as MMRV, or ProQuad.</p>.<p>Childhood vaccination with Varivax or ProQuad is given at age 12-15 months of age and 4 to 6 years of age. Varicella vaccine sometimes causes local blisters within two weeks in the injection area. Because the dose of virus is higher in Varivax, there is a small risk of transmission to others, and contact with immune suppressed people and nonimmune pregnant women should be avoided until healed. As live <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a>, ProQuad and Varivax should not be given to those with immune system problems.</p>.<p>Varicella vaccination is important for children, but it should also be considered for nonimmune adults who work with children, women who are planning pregnancy, health care professionals, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">travelers</a>, correctional institutions, and military personnel. Adults born before 1980, when chickenpox was common, are assumed to have antibodies to it. Adults born after 1980 or outside the U.S. can be screened for VZV antibodies before being offered vaccine. It is given as two doses at least four to eight weeks apart at ages 13 and over. Adults 50 years of age and over will usually receive the shingles vaccine instead.</p>.<p>Varicella-zoster vaccine (shingles vaccine) is formulated to boost varicella antibodies in older adults. The shingles <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> are indicated for adults over 50 years of age; most adults currently in this age group have had chickenpox, whether they recall it or not. There are two brands of FDA-approved shingles vaccines: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zoster_vaccine_live__shingles_vaccine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zostavax</a> and Shingrix. Zostavax is a live <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/varicella_virus_vaccine-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">varicella virus vaccine</a> that is FDA-approved to be given in one dose after age 50, however, there was no data on duration of protection, and the risk of complications from shingles is highest in those over 60 years of age. For this reason, the ACIP recommended administering Zostavax to those aged 60 and above; this decision was supported by later data showing a significant drop in protection 10 years after vaccination. Zostavax is a live vaccine, and some may develop blisters at the site of injection or very rarely disseminated lesions. Due to the theoretical risk of transmission, lesions should be covered, and contact with immunosuppressed or nonimmune pregnant individuals should be avoided until healed.</p>.<p>While boosters of Zostavax were being debated, the newer Shingrix vaccine was developed, and is now preferred. Shingrix is a non-live antigen (a VZV protein that stimulates antibodies) with an adjuvant (a molecule that activates the immune system). It is given as two doses at least eight weeks apart. Data has shown that protective levels of antibodies from Shingrix last much longer than that produced by Zostavax. As of January 2018, the ACIP has recommended Shingrix as the preferred vaccine for the prevention of shingles and its complications in older adults, starting at the FDA-approved age of 50.</p>.<p>An anticipated advantage of a non-live vaccine, Shingrix may have potential use in immunocompromised individuals who are at risk for more serious complications of shingles, such as dissemination. The ACIP awaits further evidence before recommending it as safe and effective in these individuals.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_chickenpox" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of uncomplicated chickenpox is generally good when acquired in childhood, and even in most adults, after the chickenpox rash goes away. Most people never experience chickenpox symptoms again after the first occurrence, and they are immune to other people's chickenpox. This is because the virus remains dormant in the nervous system; this also means that chickenpox can sometimes resurface later in life as shingles (zoster).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_of_shingles" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis of shingles is generally best in younger individuals, although it still causes significant discomfort. The prognosis is poorer the older the individual is when shingles occurs. This is why shingles vaccination is so important for people over the age of 50.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
