After primary infection, this group of viruses can infect many body systems and remain dormant in those cells for life. This is called "latent" infection. Latent infection can "reactivate" later in life to cause disease again. Primary infection with CMV is common and may be asymptomatic. Primary CMV is one of the common causes of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">mononucleosis</a>-like syndrome, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tiredness</a>, malaise, and other symptoms.</p>.<p>CMV infection occurs in people of all ages worldwide. Experts estimate that more than half of the adult population in the United States has been infected with CMV, and 80% of adults have had the infection by the time they are 40 years old. About one in 150 children is born with CMV infection (congenital CMV).</p>.<p>Most women (about 30% of cases) who have infants with congenital infection pass it to the baby when their latent CMV reactivates (becomes active in the blood) during pregnancy. Only about 1%-7% women are infected for the first time with CMV (primary CMV) during pregnancy, but 30%-40% of those will pass it on to the baby (congenital CMV). Congenital CMV causes more complications the earlier in pregnancy that the infection is passed from the mother, and about 10%-15% of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a> with it will have symptoms at birth, and up to 60% of these will have serious complications later in life. Of babies who are infected but born without symptoms of CMV, some may develop deafness in the months after birth. Although infections are the minority of causes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">miscarriage</a> or pregnancy loss, CMV is the leading infection to cause miscarriages.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_cytomegalovirus_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Direct contact with body fluids from an infected person exposes an individual to CMV.

People with steroid-resistant UC may need total removal of the colon (colectomy). It is not clear whether CMV is an innocent bystander in those with UC, although there is some evidence antiviral treatment may reduce colectomy in steroid-resistant cases. In these cases, CMV is found in high quantity: CMV DNA by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PCR</a> is often &gt; 250 copies/mg of tissue.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_type_of_cmv_disease_is_associated_with_hiv_%0Ainfection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv-aids_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">HIV/AIDS</a>, CMV most often reactivates when the T cell count (T helper cells, or CD4 cells) drop below 50 cells/microL. One of the most common types of CMV disease in people with advanced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hivaids_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">HIV/AIDS</a> is CMV retinitis, which may cause permanent blindness. Once highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART, or ART) was introduced in 1996, the incidence of CMV retinitis dropped almost 90%. However, some individuals still develop CMV. Some are not able to tolerate ART, or develop resistance, or simply do not adhere to treatment. CMV retinitis is a marker for 60% increased overall mortality in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv-aids_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">HIV</a>. For those whose T cell count remains low, overall mortality is 100%. In those whose T cells are under 100/microL, a dilated eye exam is recommended every six months for CMV; if T cells are under 50/microL, screening should occur every three months. CMV reactivation in these patients is not limited to the eye and may be difficult to diagnose. Other manifestations of CMV in advanced HIV disease includes encephalitis, peripheral nerve damage, and disease of the gastrointestinal tract (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esophagitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">esophagitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enteritis</a>, or colitis).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_%0Atype_of_cmv_disease_occurs_in_transplant_recipients" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In organ and marrow transplant recipients, CMV is a common cause of disease. Bone marrow recipients require more intensive chemotherapy and immune suppression for both cure of the disease requiring the transplant and to prevent rejection of the new bone marrow. They are thus at greater risk of serious CMV disease than are organ recipients. The likelihood of CMV disease in solid organ transplants ranges from 10%-30% depending on the type of organ, the level of immune suppression, and "CMV mismatch" (see below). In bone marrow transplants, allogeneic (another person as donor) transplants have a 30% likelihood of CMV disease, while autologous (self as donor) transplants have a 5% likelihood. Transplant recipients are screened for the presence of CMV-specific antibodies, which indicate whether they have latent infection (seropositive) or have never had it (seronegative).</p>.<p>CMV may cause acute primary disease if the recipient never had CMV and acquires it after transplantation. Acute primary disease may also occur if the recipient is "CMV-seronegative" and the transplanted tissue or marrow contains latent CMV (donor was "CMV-seropositive"). CMV-positive to CMV-negative transplantation may be referred to as "CMV mismatch" or "CMV D+/R-." A CMV-positive recipient's latent CMV may reactivate during the first three to six months of intensive immune suppression therapy.</p>.<p>CMV may cause either a viral syndrome or tissue invasive disease in these patients. CMV syndrome occurs within the first four months and includes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">fever</a>, malaise, and upper gastrointestinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> most commonly. Less often, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">diarrhea</a> (enterocolitis) may occur. Suppression of bone marrow with decreased white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets is common. Elevated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_blood_tests/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">liver enzymes</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">hepatitis</a>) may occur, as well. Tissue invasive disease may include CMV <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">pneumonia</a>, which can be severe. Unlike HIV, CMV neurologic disease and retinitis are very unlikely in the transplant setting.</p>.<p>Donor blood and organs are screened for CMV antibodies as part of the donor screening process. Screening and antiviral therapy (for prevention or treatment of active disease) may be necessary after CMV D+/R- transplantation. Screening for CMV is performed by regular testing for CMV DNA in the blood. While CMV may be found in the blood even without active infection, its presence in these patients, especially with a rising trend, suggests active infection. If invasive disease is suspected, CMV DNA can be sought in lung fluid (pneumonia), and tissue can be stained for CMV virus. CMV can often be detected in tissue by the way the virus particles (inclusion bodies) give cells a characteristic "owl eye" appearance.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_cmv_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>CMV is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">contagious</a> to individuals who have not been infected with it previously, but it is not especially easy to get infected. It is weakly contagious.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_is_cytomegalovirus_contagious" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The contagious period when virus is being shed in body fluids may last for months in an infected individual, and virus may be shed without symptoms at intermittent periods throughout life.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_cytomegalovirus_transmitted" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Infection with CMV is relatively common, but CMV does not spread very easily or through casual contact. Transmission requires direct contact with body fluids (such as saliva, urine, blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or breast milk) from an infected person. People may become infected with CMV through kissing, breastfeeding, sexual contact, injection <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drug use</a> (sharing needles), or organ and bone marrow transplantation. CMV can be shed in body fluids for months and intermittently for life, especially in people with compromised immunity such as HIV disease, and it may not cause any symptoms. Transfusion-transmitted CMV is possible and may pose a risk to very immunosuppressed patients. For those at high risk who need a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_transfusion/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">blood transfusion</a>, CMV-negative or "leukoreduced" blood (in which white blood cells are filtered out) may be given. However, this does not eliminate all risk.</p>.<p>CMV transmission can occur during pregnancy through the placenta from the mother's blood, or from vaginal secretions at delivery. This may cause congenital CMV infection in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">newborn</a>. Approximately 1%-7% of women who have never been infected with CMV will have their primary (first) infection during pregnancy. Approximately one-third of them will pass the CMV infection to the baby.</p>.<p>Breastfeeding can transmit CMV to the baby after birth, but there is no need to avoid breastfeeding unless the baby is premature and the doctor recommends avoiding it. Freezing and pasteurization of breast milk can lower the risk of transmission but does not eliminate it.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_incubation_period_for_cytomegalovirus" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The incubation period between the time of getting the virus and the time that symptoms develop ranges from three to 12 weeks in cases of documented CMV infection after a transfusion of infected blood. CMV infection is usually benign; and there is no public health or medical reason to screen for it routinely. In addition, CMV may be shed intermittently for a very long time. This makes it difficult to say what the incubation period may be with the commoner forms of transmission, such as contact with saliva, urine, and genital fluids.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_cytomegalovirus_infection_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most people infected with CMV do not report a history of symptoms or complications and do not recall any contact with an infected person, so most people are unaware they have been infected.

Because CMV may affect any organ system, multiple specialists may take part in the management, such as gastroenterologists (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestive system</a> specialists) or pulmonologists (lung specialists). An infectious-disease specialist is often consulted as part of the care team to assist with monitoring, preventive antivirals, diagnosis, or treatment of active infection. Pediatric infectious-disease specialists may manage the care of infants with congenital CMV.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_cytomegalovirus_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most CMV infections go undiagnosed because the virus causes little to no symptoms. When a person is infected with CMV, antibodies (proteins) to the virus called IgM and/or IgG anti-CMV antibodies develop and stay in the body for the rest of the person's life. A blood test to detect the antibodies will be positive if the person has had a CMV infection. If the antibody test is negative, the person is considered to be uninfected with CMV.</p>.<p>If a "definitive" diagnosis of active CMV infection is necessary, the virus can be found in bodily fluids (such as blood, saliva, or urine) or body tissues by culturing (growing) the virus or detecting its DNA or specific protein called pp65 antigen by PCR tests. These tests are done if a person has signs and symptoms consistent with an active CMV infection. The virus can become reactivated from its latent state (latent infection) when a person's immune system has weakened. Tissue biopsy of affected body systems may sometimes show clumps of CMV in the cells, called "inclusion bodies." CMV inclusion bodies make the infected cell look like an "owl's eye" under the microscope.</p>.<p>These tests may be done if a woman develops symptoms of CMV infection during pregnancy in order to provide counseling and possible treatment for congenital CMV. They may also be done to diagnose a congenital CMV infection if CMV is detected in a newborn's urine, saliva, blood, or other body tissues within two to three weeks after birth.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_cytomegalovirus_infection" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no cure for CMV, and treatment for CMV infection is not necessary in healthy children and adults. Those at very high risk of developing severe CMV infection may be placed on antiviral medication to help prevent CMV disease. This pretreatment is called prophylaxis.

The antiviral medications against CMV include the following:</p>.<p>No antiviral drug is currently available for the prevention of congenital CMV infection. However, some infants who have infection involving the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) may benefit from treatment.
