<p><b><a name="pregnancy_planning_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_pregnancy_planning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnancy planning begins even before conception for many women. Others choose to start planning when they are aware of a pregnancy. While it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy and baby without a pregnancy plan, developing a pregnancy plan is one way to help ensure that your baby has the greatest chances of having good health and that you have a healthy pregnancy. Planning for pregnancy typically involves:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_goals_pre-pregnancy_planning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Before a woman becomes pregnant she can discuss her medical history with a doctor, focusing on the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_pregnancy_calendar_or_calculator" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pregnancy calendar</a> or calculator is a tool that helps a woman determine precisely which changes are taking place in her body and in the fetus at a given week of pregnancy. Calculators are also available to predict a woman's due date. Many versions of pregnancy calendars and calculators can be found online.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_soon_can_a_woman_start_trying_to_conceive_after_stopping_birth_control" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A woman is physiologically able to become pregnant as soon as she is no longer using <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">birth control</a>. For certain hormonal methods designed for longer-term <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">contraception</a>, the effects can take some time to wear off so pregnancy is possible when the hormonal effects wear off.

For this reason, it is best to avoid certain diets in pregnancy. In particular, high-fat diets, some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vegetarian_diet_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">vegetarian</a> diets, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> diets should generally be avoided by pregnant women. A healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a> also means limiting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sugar</a> intake. Many women also choose to start eating a healthy diet in the stage prior to conception to maximize their chances of delivering a healthy baby. In general, a healthy diet is the same for both pregnant women and non-pregnant women, with a few special exceptions that will be discussed below.</p>.<p>Evidence about whether consumption of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">caffeine</a> in pregnancy is detrimental has been inconclusive. However, it is known that the fetus metabolizes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">caffeine</a> very slowly, so maternal consumption of caffeine results in a prolonged exposure for the fetus. Consumption of typical levels of caffeine has not been associated with any adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet individual studies have shown that caffeine can lead to changes in fetal arousal and heart rate. According to many experts, including the American Academy of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Nutrition</a> and Dietetics, caffeine intake in pregnant women should be limited to 200 mg per day (equivalent to one 12 oz. cup).</p>.<p>Women who are planning to become pregnant are advised to take folic acid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">supplements</a> to reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects in the fetus. The neural tube closes early in pregnancy (18 to 26 days after conception) so supplementation with folic acid is most critical during the early days of pregnancy. Often, supplementation after the diagnosis of pregnancy is too late to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">Vitamins</a> containing 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid, taken daily, are recommended.</p>.<p>Due to the presence of certain environmental toxins (such as mercury), the kinds and amount of fish (and shellfish) that are eaten during pregnancy should be regulated. The US FDA has issued guidance for pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy regarding the types and amount of fish that should be eaten.</p>.<p>Megavitamins may not be safe for pregnant women, since excessive doses of vitamins can be harmful and their effects on the fetus have not been fully studied. Megadoses of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_a-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">vitamin A</a> in early pregnancy have been linked to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">birth defects</a>. Women planning pregnancy and who are pregnant also are advised not to consume nonessential <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dietary supplements</a> or herbal preparations, since their effects on the developing fetus are unknown. The safest choice for women planning a pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin supplement that contains folic acid and iron.</p>.<p>Pregnant women also should try to avoid unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, deli and luncheon meats, and undercooked or raw animal foods. This is due to the risk of exposure to <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/listeria/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Listeria</a> monocytogenes</i>, common bacteria that can cause miscarriages and other problems. Fruits and vegetables should be washed well before consumption.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_much_weight_gain_is_recommended_in_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The mother's pre-pregnancy weight should be taken into account when estimating how much weight gain is appropriate for a healthy pregnancy. Women with multiple gestation pregnancies will need to gain more weight to maintain a healthy pregnancy than those with singleton pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued guidelines for recommended weight gain in women who have a singleton pregnancy. They are as follows:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_about_alcohol_consumption_and_pregnancy_planning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions reflecting the possible effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. These include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fetal_alcohol_syndrome_fas/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fetal alcohol syndrome</a> (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disabilities (ARND). Fetal alcohol syndrome is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities in children. The exact amount of alcohol exposure that is associated with these disorders has not been determined, so there is no known limit for safe alcohol consumption in pregnancy. For this reason, women planning to conceive and pregnant women are advised not to drink alcohol.</p>.<p><b><a name="should_i_exercise_when_pregnant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Exercise is part of a healthy lifestyle and is recommended for healthy pregnant women who have uncomplicated pregnancies, with a few exceptions. You should always discuss your exercise program with your doctor. Recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology state that pregnant women who have an uncomplicated pregnancy should participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. However, there are some sports with an increased risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> to the abdomen that should be avoided. These include ice hockey, kickboxing, soccer, and horseback riding. Scuba diving should also be avoided in pregnancy since it poses a risk of decompression sickness ("the bends") to the fetus.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_safe_to_have_sexual_intercourse_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For most women, sex during pregnancy is safe. Your doctor may recommend avoiding sexual intercourse if you have certain conditions or risk factors. These include prior preterm labor, multiple miscarriages, infection, bleeding, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amniocentesis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">amniotic fluid</a> leak, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_placenta_previa/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">placenta previa</a> (low placenta). Pregnant women should not have sexual activity that would put them at risk for contracting a sexually-transmitted disease (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/std_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">STD</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_safe_to_diet_during_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pregnant women should always follow a healthy nutrition plan that is optimized for both mother and baby (see previous sections on dietary considerations and weight gain). A weight reduction diet is not appropriate for pregnant women. Even women who are overweight or obese prior to the pregnancy will need to gain weight during pregnancy, although some may need to gain slightly less weight than normal-weight women. Women who are overweight or obese should discuss with their doctor the best amount of weight gain weight gain for the pregnancy.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_air_travel_safe_for_pregnant_women" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, occasional air travel in pregnancy is considered safe, and there are no data to show that air travel adversely affects pregnancy outcomes for occasional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">travelers</a>. Most airlines allow women to fly up to the 36th week of gestation. Women who have high-risk pregnancies and are at risk for preterm labor or who may require emergency care should avoid air travel. It is generally recommended that pregnant women traveling by air take precaution to decrease their risk of developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> (thrombi) in the extremities. The use of support stockings, frequent ambulation, and remaining well hydrated can help reduce the risks of developing a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> in the legs during long flights.</p>.<p><b><a name="do_medications_need_to_be_stopped_when_planning_pregnancy_or_when_a_woman_%0Abecomes_pregnant" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Part of pregnancy planning involves attention to underlying or pre-existing medical conditions that may affect a woman's pregnancy. Women who take regular medications should review their medication schedule (including any over-the-counter medications or supplements) with their doctor when planning to conceive. Some medications may be harmful to the fetus, while other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> are safe for pregnant women. It may be necessary to discontinue certain medications or change to alternate medications in some cases. For example, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acne</a> medication <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/isotretinoin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">isotretinoin</a> (Accutane) has been shown to cause birth defects in the fetus.</p>.<p>In some cases the effects of a particular medication may be unclear in pregnant women. In these cases a decision must be made regarding the necessity of the medication for the mother's health versus possible or unknown risks to the fetus.</p>.<p>Women taking oral contraceptives who become pregnant are not believed to be at any increased risk for poor outcomes, although the oral contraceptives should be discontinued immediately.</p>.<p>It is safe for women who become ill during pregnancy to be treated with many medications; however, some medications, including some antibiotics and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> relief medicines, may not be recommended for pregnant women. It is important if you require medication to tell your doctor that you may be pregnant or are trying to conceive.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_infections_should_be_avoided_in_pregnancy" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned above, avoiding certain foods can help prevent infection with <i>Listeria</i> bacteria, which can cause problems with pregnancy.

As previously mentioned, infection with the parasite <i>Toxoplasma</i> also is a risk for pregnant women.</p>.<p><strong>Rubella virus infection</strong> in early pregnancy can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">miscarriage</a> or birth defects. Therefore, women of childbearing age are tested for immunity to this virus, and those lacking antibodies to the rubella virus should be vaccinated against this virus.</p>.<p><strong>Cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV) is a common viral infection that typically does not cause problems or symptoms. About 1%-4% of pregnant women have the infection, and those with active infection will pass it to their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">babies</a> in about one-third of cases.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can have multiple effects in the newborn. The infection may be limited to the eyes, skin and mouth. It may be localized to the central nervous system or may be widespread. Antiviral medications are given to the newborn after delivery. Cesarean delivery (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/c-section_cesarean_birth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">C-section</a>) is recommended for most women with an active outbreak of genital HSV infection at the time of labor to prevent transmission of the infection to the baby.</p>.<p><strong>Parvovirus B19 </strong>causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fifth_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fifth disease</a>, a common mild disease of childhood that is spread by respiratory secretions or blood. Pregnant women who have not previously had fifth disease should avoid contact with people with the condition since parvovirus B-19 can infect the fetus. About 65% of pregnant women in North America have evidence of previous infection with parvovirus B-19, while acute parvovirus B-19 infection occurs in up to 2% of pregnant women in endemic periods. About 30% of women who develop parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy will transmit the infection across the placenta to the fetus. Although no birth defects have been reported as a result of fifth disease, the infection can cause fetal death. For women who contract parvovirus in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">first trimester</a>, the rate of fetal loss can be as high as 10%.

After receiving the varicella vaccine, women should wait 30 days before attempting conception.</p>.<p><strong><i>Toxoplasma</i> </strong>is a parasite that is transmitted through cat feces and raw meats, especially pork. As with infection with the rubella virus, toxoplasmosis can cause birth defects if the infection occurs during early pregnancy.
