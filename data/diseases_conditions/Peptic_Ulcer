<p><b><a name="peptic_ulcer_stomach_duodenum_definition_and_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_a_peptic_ulcer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A peptic ulcer (stomach or duodenal) is a break in the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. A peptic ulcer of the stomach is called a gastric ulcer; of the duodenum, a duodenal ulcer; and of the esophagus, an esophageal ulcer. Peptic ulcers occur when the lining these organs is eroded by the acidic digestive (peptic) juices that the cells of the lining secrete of the stomach secrete. A peptic ulcer differs from an erosion because it extends deeper into the lining and incites more of an inflammatory reaction from the tissues that are involved, occasionally with scaring. Peptic ulcer also is referred to as peptic ulcer disease.</p>.<p>Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting millions of Americans yearly. Moreover, peptic ulcers are a recurrent problem; even healed ulcers can recur unless treatment is directed at preventing their recurrence. The medical cost of treating peptic ulcer and its complications runs into billions of dollars annually. Recent medical advances have increased our understanding of ulcer formation. Improved and expanded treatment options now are available.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_peptic_ulcers" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Symptoms of esophageal, duodenal or stomach ulcer disease vary. Many people with ulcers experience minimal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a>, abdominal discomfort that occurs after meals or no discomfort at all. Commonly people complain of upper abdominal burning or hunger pain one to three hours after meals or in the middle of the night. Food or antacids that neutralize stomach acid often promptly relieve these symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_peptic_ulcers_painful" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The pain of ulcer disease correlates poorly with the presence or severity of active ulceration. Some individuals have persistent pain even after an ulcer is almost completely healed by medication. Others experience no pain at all. Ulcers often come and go spontaneously without the individual ever knowing that they are present unless a serious complication (like bleeding or perforation) occurs.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_peptic_ulcers" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For many years, excess acid was believed to be the major cause of ulcer disease. Accordingly, the emphasis of treatment was on neutralizing and inhibiting the secretion of stomach acid. While acid is still considered necessary for the formation of ulcers and its suppression is still the primary treatment, the two most important initiating causes of ulcers are infection of the stomach by a bacterium named "<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/helicobacter_pylori/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Helicobacter pylori</a></i>" (<i>H. pylori</i>) and chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or NSAIDs, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cigarette smoking</a> also is an important cause of ulcers as well as failure of ulcer healing.</p>.<p>Infection with <i>H. pylori</i> is very common, affecting more than a billion people worldwide. It is estimated that half of the United States population older than age 60 has been infected with <i>H. pylori</i>. Infection usually persists for many years, leading to ulcer disease in 10% to 15% of those infected. In the past, <i>H. pylori</i> was found in more than 80% of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers. With increasing appreciation, diagnosis and treatment of this infection, the prevalence of infection with <i>H. pylori</i> as well as the proportion of ulcers caused by the bacterium has decreased. It is estimated that currently only 20% of ulcers are associated with the bacterium. While the mechanism by which <i>H. pylori</i> causes ulcers is complex, elimination of the bacterium by antibiotics has clearly been shown to heal ulcers and prevent their recurrence.</p>.<p>NSAIDs are medications used for the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a> and other painful inflammatory conditions in the body.

Prostaglandins are substances produced by the body, which are important in helping the linings of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to resist damage by the acidic digestive juices of the stomach.

Therefore, biopsies often are performed on gastric ulcers to exclude <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_there_a_special_diet_for_peptic_ulcer_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no conclusive evidence that dietary restrictions and bland diets play a role in ulcer healing. No proven relationship exists between peptic ulcer disease and the intake of coffee and alcohol. However, since coffee stimulates gastric acid secretion, and alcohol can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastritis</a>, moderation in alcohol and coffee consumption is recommended.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_peptic_ulcers_can_they_be_cured" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The goal of ulcer treatment is to relieve pain, heal the ulcer, and prevent complications. The first step in treatment involves the reduction of risk factors (NSAIDs and cigarettes). The next step is medications.</p>.<p>Many people harbor <em>H. pylori </em>in their stomachs without ever having pain or ulcers. It is not completely clear whether these patients should be treated with antibiotics. More studies are needed to answer this question.</p>.<p>Patients with documented ulcer disease and <em>H. pylori </em>infection should be treated for both the ulcer and the <em>H. pylori</em>. <em>H. pylori</em> can be very difficult to completely eradicate. Treatment requires a combination of several antibiotics, sometimes in combination with a proton-pump inhibitor, H2 blockers, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bismuth_subsalicylate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Pepto-Bismol</a>.

While H2 blockers are effective in ulcer healing, they have a limited role in eradicating <i>H. pylori</i> without antibiotics.

The different proton-pump inhibitors are very similar in action and there is no evidence that one is more effective than the other in healing ulcers. While proton-pump inhibitors are comparable to H2 blockers in effectiveness in treating gastric and duodenal ulcers, they are superior to H2 blockers in treating esophageal ulcers. Esophageal ulcers are more sensitive than gastric and duodenal ulcers to minute amounts of acid. Therefore, more complete acid suppression accomplished by proton-pump inhibitors is important for esophageal ulcer healing.</p>.<p>Proton-pump inhibitors are well tolerated. Side effects are uncommon; they include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation_myths_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">constipation</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>.

A duodenal ulcer that has perforated can burrow into adjacent organs such as the pancreas or behind the abdomen and into the back. An esophageal ulcer that perforates can cause severe inflammation of the tissues that surround it (mediastinitis).</p>.<p>If an ulcer occurs in the narrow outlet from the stomach, it can obstruct the flow of stomach contents into the duodenum.
