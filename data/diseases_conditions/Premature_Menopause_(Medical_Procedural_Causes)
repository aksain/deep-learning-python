It is defined medically as the absence of menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months. The average age for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">natural menopause</a> is 51. Sometimes, menopause occurs earlier, due to diseases, genetic factors, or surgery. There is also a wide variation among women regarding the timing of normal menopause.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_early_menopause" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As mentioned previously, menopause before the age of 40 are considered to be in premature, or early, menopause. One medical causes of premature menopause is known as premature ovarian failure. Technically, premature ovarian failure is not the same as premature menopause. In premature ovarian failure, the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. Women with premature ovarian failure may still occasionally have menstrual periods, but they typically experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">infertility</a>. Premature ovarian failure is usually accompanied <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premature_ovarian_failure_pof/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">primary ovarian insufficiency</a>. Premature ovarian failure is usually accompanied by the symptoms of premature menopause.</p>.<p>Premature menopause can also be caused by treatments for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancers</a> or other conditions that involve chemotherapy and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation therapy</a> to the pelvis. These treatments can damage the ovaries and result in ovarian failure.</p>.<p>Surgery to remove the ovaries, either for benign or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a> conditions, results in premature menopause if both ovaries are removed. Surgery to remove the uterus results in menopause only in the sense that menstrual bleeding does not occur. In that case, the ovaries will continue to produce hormones.</p>.<p>Other infrequent causes that may lead to premature menopause include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>, chronic diseases, pituitary and hypothalamic tumors, psychiatric disorders, and other relatively rare or undefined conditions.</p>.<p><b><a name="risk_factors_for_early_menopause" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Premature ovarian failure affects about 1 out of every 1000 women from ages 15 to 29 and about 1 out of every 100 women aged 30 to 39. It can be related to genetic (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>) factors, to illnesses like autoimmune diseases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thyroid disease</a>, viral infection, hormonal disorders, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eating_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eating disorders</a>. The risk of premature ovarian failure risk increases in women who have relatives with the condition.</p>.<p>Women at risk for surgical or treatment-<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">induced menopause</a> are those who are undergoing treatment for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> or other conditions that require surgical removal of the female organs.</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_early_menopause" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of premature menopause are those of typical menopause.

At that point, they may be tested to determine their ovarian function. For example, tests may be done to rule out <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> or other causes of missed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstruation</a>, such as certain thyroid diseases. The level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is often measured in the blood to determine whether a woman is nearing menopause and to ascertain the functional status of her ovaries. FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen, so levels of this hormone rise when estrogen levels drop. FSH levels that are higher than 40 mIU/ml are considered diagnostic of the menopause. Levels of ovarian hormones, such as estradiol, may be also measured, as low levels (levels less than 32 pg/ml) are suggestive of menopause.</p>.<p><b><a name="treatments_to_relieve_signs_and_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is no treatment that can reverse or prevent premature menopause.
