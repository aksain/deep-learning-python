If the child's death remains unexplained after a formal investigation into the circumstances of the death (including performance of a complete <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autopsy</a>, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history), the death is then attributed to SIDS. Sudden infant death is a tragic event for any parent or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caregiving/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caregiver</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_cause_of_sids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause (or causes) of SIDS is still unknown. Despite the dramatic decrease in the occurrence of SIDS in the United States and worldwide in recent years, SIDS remains one of the leading causes of death during infancy beyond the first 30 days following birth. It is generally accepted that SIDS may be the result of multiple interacting factors.</p>.<p>Even though the specific cause (or causes) of SIDS remains unknown, scientific efforts have eliminated several previously held theories. We now know the following about SIDS: </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_sids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Research studies continue to demonstrate a greater risk for SIDS among male infants. SIDS is observed more frequently during winter months than summer months, although this distribution is not as pronounced in recent years as it had been in the past. In the United States, both African-American and Native-American infants have a higher rate of SIDS than do Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian infants. </p>.<p>Certain infant-care practices have an effect on the risk for SIDS. Most notable is the increased risk associated with the placement of infants on their stomachs (prone sleep position) for sleep. The "Back to Sleep" campaign was launched in the United States in 1994 and embodies a public-health effort encouraging families to place infants on their backs (supine sleep position) to sleep. Since the start of this campaign, SIDS rates have dropped 50% in the United States. Similar drops have been observed worldwide, highlighting the importance of the supine sleep position for infants. </p>.<p>Other factors increasing the risk for SIDS include exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cigarette</a> smoke, bed-sharing or co-sleeping, over-bundling or the covering of the infant's head by bed covers, loose bedding, or blankets. Research studies continue to suggest that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breastfeeding</a> and pacifier use may reduce the risk of SIDS. </p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_sids_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Sudden infant death remains an unpredictable, unpreventable, and largely inexplicable tragedy. The baby is seemingly healthy without any sign of distress or significant illness prior to the incident.</p>.<p>Sudden, unexpected infant death (SUID) is a general term used for the circumstance of an infant death which occurs suddenly and in an unexpected manner. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other causes of death must be ruled out. The cause of an infant's death can be determined only through a process of collecting information and conducting, at times, complex forensic tests and procedures. All other recognizable causes of death are investigated prior to making the diagnosis of SIDS.</p>.<p>Four major avenues of investigation aid in the determination of a SIDS death: postmortem lab tests, autopsy, death-scene investigation, and the review of victim and family case history.</p>.<p><b><a name="can_sids_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is currently no way to predict which infants are at risk for SIDS. SIDS has been linked to certain infant-specific and sleep-environment factors. Therefore, observing the following precautions has reduced the risk of SIDS for many infants.</p>.<p><b><a name="does_the_supine_back_sleep_position_cause_any_problems_for_infants" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recent studies have evaluated the effect of back sleeping on an infant's motor development. Babies younger than 1 year of age who slept on their backs showed slightly decreased upper trunk strength as reflected in mild delays in their ability to crawl, sit upright unassisted, or pull to stand.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_support_is_available_to_parents_who_are_coping_with_an_infant_loss_due_to_sids" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most areas within the United States have access to support services for families following a SIDS death. Each family's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_grief_and_bereavement/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">grief</a> is unique. However, many families that have experienced SIDS have found it helpful to use the counseling resources that may be provided through public-health <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nursing</a> agencies, local coroner, or medical examiner offices, or information and counseling programs based at many children's hospitals across the country.</p>.<p>Losing a child is a unique crisis for any family, especially when the child has died suddenly, unexpectedly, and for no apparent reason.</p>.<p>Grieving is a normal process when dealing with the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_grief_and_bereavement/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loss of a loved one</a>. Family, friends, neighbors, workplace, or faith communities may all serve as sources of support. It is important to remember that you are not alone.
