<p><b><a name="bulimia_nervosa_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Bulimia, also called bulimia nervosa, is one of a number of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eating_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eating disorders</a>. This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_illness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mental illness</a> is characterized by episodes of bingeing and somehow purging the food and/or associated calories in the pursuit of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>. About 1%-2% of adolescent girls in the United States develop bulimia. While bulimia and other eating disorders tend to occur most often in Caucasian females in this country, males and ethnic minorities are increasingly developing eating disorders. Bulimia is also often co-morbid (co-occurs with) body dysmorphic disorder, which involves the sufferer having a false sense that something is defective with their appearance beyond weight.</p>.<p>Women with eating disorders tend to have higher rates of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">infertility</a> than women without an eating disorder, in that eating disordered women have lower rates of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> and childbirth. When pregnancy is achieved by women with eating disorders, more than 7% of women suffer from some form of eating disorder during that time, with more than 2% engaging in both bingeing and some form of purging behaviors. Given the changes in body chemistry that such behaviors can cause, bulimia during pregnancy can pose significant health risks for the developing fetus.</p>.<p>This illness is a significant public-health problem both because of the physical and mental-health effects it can have. Bulimia often co-occurs with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">anxiety</a>, and substance-abuse disorders and results in a loss of productivity due to disability that is higher than that of disability caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">depression</a> and anxiety combined.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_causes_and_risk_factors_for_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
While there is no known specific cause for bulimia, family history and environmental stressors are thought to contribute to the development of the illness. Generally, while people who have relatives with bulimia are at a higher risk of developing the disorder, this may be as much the result of inherited perfectionism and rigidity as it is an inheritance of the disorder itself. Some life stressors, like family economic problems, can increase the chance of developing bulimia as an adult.</p>.<p>
Adolescents are at greatest risk for developing bulimia, as statistics show that about three-quarters of people who develop the illness do so before they reach 22 years of age, most often at 15 to 16 years of age. Adolescents who have any eating problem by 12 years of age are at higher risk for developing bulimia, but children with eating problems as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">babies</a> are not necessarily at higher risk for getting the illness.</p>.<p>
High <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain_shockers_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">body mass index</a>, low self-esteem, and being part of a family that is suffering from financial difficulties are risk factors for developing purging behaviors. Involvement in activities that highly reward thinness, like gymnastics, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">running</a>, wrestling, horse jockeying, or modeling, are other risk factors for developing bulimia.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_symptoms_and_signs_of_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Symptoms of bulimia include repeated episodes of bingeing and purging. Binges are defined as uncontrolled episodes of eating food amounts in a short period of time that are clearly more than most people would consume in a similar time period. People with bulimia have trouble controlling their eating during the binges. They also engage in some form of repeated undoing of the excessive food/calories they ingest that occurs during episodes of binge eating. Examples of purging behaviors include making oneself throw up, fasting, excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a>, or abuse of laxatives, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> pills, diuretics, or other medications. Bulimic individuals tend to have their self-esteem excessively linked to their appearance in terms of body shape and weight.</p>.<p>
Physical signs and symptoms that can be associated with bulimia include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>, discolored, deteriorating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>/cramping and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bloating</a> associated with repeated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>. Individuals with bulimia may develop swollen salivary glands that give the sufferer bigger cheeks. They may also develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_skin/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dry skin</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thinning hair</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_physicians_diagnose_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Many providers of health care may help make the diagnosis of bulimia, including licensed mental-health therapists, pediatricians, other primary-care providers, specialists whom you see for a medical condition, emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers. One of these professionals will likely conduct or refer the 
individual with bulimia for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of establishing the diagnosis. Bulimia may be associated with a number of other medical conditions, so 
health-care professionals may perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms.</p>.<p>
As part of this examination, a health-care professional may ask the sufferer a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>.  Thorough exploration for any history or presence of mental-health symptoms will be conducted so that bulimia can be distinguished from other types of eating disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anorexia_nervosa/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anorexia</a> nervosa, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/binge_eating_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">binge eating disorder</a>, or pica, or as part of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">genetic disorder</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prader-willi_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prader-Willi Syndrome</a>. The mental-health professional will also explore whether other forms of mental illness are present.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Studies on treatment effectiveness for bulimia seem to show that psychotherapy treatment for bulimia is superior to medication or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias_picture_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">behavior therapy</a>.  Cognitive behavior therapy is thought to be somewhat superior to other forms of psychotherapy in treating this eating disorder. This form of psychotherapy helps to alleviate bulimia and reduce the likelihood that it will come back by helping the eating disorder sufferer change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals:</p>.<p>
Family therapy is also often used to treat bulimia, particularly for adolescent sufferers. It usually takes place in three phases:</p>.<p>
Nutritional counseling involves teaching the bulimic individual how to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a> in a 
healthy way. It has been found to help decrease the sufferer's tendency to 
engage in purging behaviors.</p>.<p>
Regarding medication treatment of bulimia, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluoxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fluoxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluoxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prozac</a>) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of this condition. Fluoxetine is a member of the serotonergic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antidepressants</a> (SSRIs). Other SSRIs, as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">serotonin</a>/norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/venlafaxine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">venlafaxine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/venlafaxine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Effexor</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/duloxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">duloxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/duloxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cymbalta</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tricyclic_antidepressants-oral_injection/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tricyclic antidepressants</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/imipramine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">imipramine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/imipramine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tofranil</a>) and amitryptiline (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amitriptyline/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Elavil</a>), have also been shown to decrease 
the binge eating and purging symptoms of bulimia.</p>.<p>
SSRIs tend to have fewer side effects than the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Also, SSRIs do not cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/orthostatic_hypotension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">orthostatic hypotension</a> (sudden drop in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> when sitting up or standing) and heart-rhythm disturbances like the TCAs do. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line treatment for bulimia. Examples of other SSRIs include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">paroxetine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paroxetine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Paxil</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sertraline/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sertraline</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sertraline/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Zoloft</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/citalopram/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">citalopram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/citalopram/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Celexa</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluvoxamine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fluvoxamine</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fluvoxamine/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Luvox</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/escitalopram/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">escitalopram</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/escitalopram/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lexapro</a>).</p>.<p>  
SSRIs are generally well tolerated, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>, agitation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insomnia</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience sexual side effects, such as decreased sexual desire (decreased libido), delayed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_health_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">orgasm</a>, or an inability to have an orgasm. Some patients experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a> with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a rare but serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs. It is characterized by high fevers, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a>, and heart-rhythm disturbances. This condition tends to occur only in very ill psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.</p>.<p>
The antiepileptic medication <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/topiramate/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">topiramate</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/topiramate/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Topamax</a>) has also been shown to significantly decrease binge eating and is sometimes used to treat people who do not respond to or have intolerable side effects from the other medications.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_complications_of_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
The potential dangers of bulimia can be severe and affect virtually every organ system. The malnutrition that can result from inducing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> 
and abusing laxatives, diet pills, and/or diuretics (medications that cause increased urinating) can result in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low blood pressure</a> to the point of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fainting</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cold_hands/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold hands</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a>, abnormalities in body chemistry (abnormal electrolyte levels), as well as abnormal hormone levels, failure to ovulate, and delayed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">puberty</a>. Permanent complications can include stunted growth, decreased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bone density</a>, and changes in the person's brain structure. Severe complications can include irregular heartbeat and rectal prolapse. People with bulimia tend to have twice the mortality rates as individuals with no eating disorder. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Suicide</a> is a significant component of the higher mortality rate.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>	
In contrast to illnesses like depression, that can have as much as a 75% recovery rate, only about 45% of people with bulimia fully recover. Most full recovery takes place between four and nine years later. About 27% of bulimia sufferers significantly improve without full recovery, and more than 20% continue to have chronic symptoms or switch to having another eating disorder.</p>.<p>
The mortality rate of bulimia, at 0.3%, is many times less than that of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eating_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anorexia</a>, which is about 5%. Both of these eating disorders often co-occur with 
depressive, anxiety, and other mood disorders, as well as with personality 
disorders like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/borderline_personality_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">borderline personality disorder</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
Most bulimia <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a> programs focus on educating the public and at-risk populations like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teens</a> about the dangers of the disorder (psycho-education). While psycho-education has been found to increase the knowledge of those who receive it, studies do not show more than minimal change in behavior. More successful than passive psycho-education seems to be prevention approaches that specifically address eating-disordered ways of thinking, like considering thinness as the ideal body type.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_one_find_more_information_about_bulimia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>
