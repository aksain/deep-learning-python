<p><b><a name="what_is_carotid_artery_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The carotid arteries provide blood supply to the head. There are two common 
carotid arteries, located on each side of the neck, that divide into the 
internal and external carotid arteries. The external carotid artery provides 
blood supply to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a>, face, and neck while the internal carotid artery 
supplies blood to the brain.</p>.<p>Narrowing of the internal carotid artery may decrease blood supply to half of 
the brain that it supplies. This narrowing called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">atherosclerosis</a> (atheroma = 
lump of plaque + sclerosis = hardening) occurs because of the accumulation of 
plaque on the inside of the artery wall. Plaque begins as a soft, waxy 
collection of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/triglyceride_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">triglycerides</a> but over time begins to harden and 
calcify. Often it occurs where increased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood pressure</a> and blood turbulence 
irritates the inner lining of the artery and this often occurs where the 
internal and external carotid arteries split (bifurcation).</p>.<p>As the carotid artery begins to further narrow, the pressure within the 
artery continues to increase. This may cause the plaque to rupture, causing 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a> to form. A large clot may completely block (occlude) the artery or 
smaller clots and bits of plaque may travel into smaller arteries within the 
brain and cause disruption of blood supply to parts of brain tissue.</p>.<p>It is only when a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/transient_ischemic_attack_tia_mini-stroke/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">transient ischemic attack</a> occurs, or a bruit 
(blowing or whistling sound) is found on physical examination by your doctor, 
that the diagnosis of carotid artery disease is usually made. Otherwise, the 
narrowing carotid artery does not cause symptoms.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_carotid_artery_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Carotid artery disease occurs because of damage to the inner lining of the 
artery. This is a gradual process that is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, high blood 
pressure, high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol levels</a>, and poorly controlled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>. These all may 
cause minor damage to the inner walls of an artery, and during the healing 
process, inflammation may occur and plaque may begin to form.</p>.<p>Over time, the area of plaque may grow and narrow the lumen of the artery, 
the channel where blood flows. It becomes a vicious circle as the narrower lumen 
increases pressure within the artery and blood turbulence, which leads to more 
arterial wall damage and more plaque formation.</p>.<p>

of five of the following need to be present: </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_carotid_artery_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Carotid artery disease in itself has no symptoms. It is only when blood flow 
to parts of the brain is decreased that the diagnosis is made. Decreased blood 
supply to the brain may result in either a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/transient_ischemic_attack_tia_mini-stroke/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">TIA</a> (transient ischemic attack) or

on its own and should be considered a warning sign that a stroke is imminent. 
</p>.<p>Symptoms for a TIA may include:</p>.<p>While the symptoms tend to resolve on their own in a few minutes, they may last up to 24 hours.</p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of a stroke are similar to a TIA but the effects are 
permanent without successful treatment.</p>.<p>Since there is no way of knowing whether the symptoms will resolve, any of 
these symptoms should be considered a medical emergency and the patient or 
family should call 911 to activate the emergency medical services. Individuals who 
are having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke symptoms</a> may be candidates for treatment with clot busting

source of the bleed. The carotid 
arteries may be evaluated as a potential cause of the TIA or stroke. This is an important part of the diagnosis 
and treatment of a transient ischemic attack, since the TIA is a warning sign a 
stroke may be imminent. Finding a treatable cause and minimizing risk of a 
future stroke is an important component of patient treatment.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ultrasound</a> is the most common screening test to determine whether carotid 
artery stenosis (narrowing) is present. Sound waves are used to understand the 
anatomy of the artery to see whether narrowing is present. Adding Doppler 
technology, the amount of blood flow and its velocity can be measured.</p>.<p>Should ultrasound detect carotid artery disease, the next step is to better 
show the anatomy of the arteries that supply the brain. 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Angiography</a> 
is a procedure used to identify any structural abnormalities within the large 
and small arteries that supply blood to the brain. Historically, angiography was performed with a 
catheter threaded into the artery and having dye injected to outline the blood 
vessels. In some patients, the artery anatomy can be seen using 
CT (computerized 
tomography) or MR (magnetic resonance) angiograms. In both CT ad MR 
angiographies, dye is injected into an arm vein, instead of an artery.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_carotid_artery_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for carotid artery disease needs to be individualized for each 
patient and situation. Discuss your options with your doctor. Possible 
treatments include:</p>.<p>If the carotid artery is less than 50% narrowed, medical treatment is 
recommended. This includes stepwise 
antiplatelet therapy. Platelets are blood 
cells that help clot blood and in patients who have had symptomatic carotid 
artery disease, meaning that they have experienced a TIA, and decreasing 
platelet stickiness may be helpful in minimizing future stroke events. The first 
line medication is to treat the disease is
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a>. If the patient was already taking an aspirin and 
still experienced a TIA, the next line medication may be <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dipyridamole-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dipyridamole</a>/aspirin 
combination (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aspirin-dipyridamole_er-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Aggrenox</a>) or clopidogrel (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clopidogrel/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Plavix</a>).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="surgery_for_carotid_artery_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery is a potential option for patients with more significant carotid 
artery disease. </p>.<p>Two options exist, 1) carotid endarterectomy, and 2) carotid 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angioplasty/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">angioplasty</a> with stenting. </p>.<p>Surgery is recommended for symptomatic patients who have carotid artery 
narrowing greater than 70%. Surgery may or may not be of benefit for symptomatic 
patients whose narrowing is between 50% and 69%.</p>.<p>Some patients decide to be screened by ultrasound for carotid artery disease 
even though they have no symptoms. Surgery is a controversial treatment option 
for asymptomatic patients who have narrowing greater than 60%.</p>.<p>Surgery is not recommended for patients:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_carotid_artery_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Brain cells cannot be replaced and do not regenerate. Loss of blood supply to 
the brain will quickly cause brain cells to die. The eventual result of carotid 
artery disease is transient ischemic attack and stroke. The narrower the artery, 
the more likely a stroke will occur. However, it is impossible to say with 
certainty which individual will or will not develop stroke symptoms. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="can_carotid_artery_disease_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prevention</a> is the cornerstone for treating carotid artery disease.

carotid artery disease. The decision as to which treatment is offered depends 
upon the age of the patient, their neurologic status, their other underlying 
medical conditions, and the degree of carotid artery narrowing. </p>.<p>The purpose of treatment is to reduce the risk of stroke. In patients whose
