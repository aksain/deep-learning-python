This happens because the cells that make pigment (color) in the skin are destroyed. These cells are called melanocytes (ma-LAN-o-sites). Vitiligo can also affect the mucous membranes (such as the tissue inside the mouth and nose) and the eye.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_vitiligo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The cause is not known. Vitiligo may be an autoimmune disease. These diseases happen when your immune system mistakenly attacks some part of your own body. In vitiligo, the immune system may destroy the melanocytes in the skin. It is also possible that one or more genes may make a person more likely to get the disorder.</p>.<p>Some researchers think that the melanocytes destroy themselves. Others think that a single event such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sunburn_and_sun_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunburn</a> or emotional distress can cause vitiligo. But these events have not been proven to cause vitiligo.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_affected_by_vitiligo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Many people develop it in their twenties, but it can occur at any age. The disorder affects all races and both sexes equally, however, it is more noticeable in people with dark skin.</p>.<p>People with certain autoimmune diseases (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hyperthyroidism</a>) are more likely to get vitiligo than people who don't have any autoimmune diseases. Scientists do not know why vitiligo is connected with these diseases. However, most people with vitiligo have no other autoimmune disease.</p>.<p>Vitiligo may also run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. However, most children will not get vitiligo even if a parent has it.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_vitiligo" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>White patches on the skin are the main sign of vitiligo. These patches are more common in areas where the skin is exposed to the sun. The patches may be on the hands, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a>, arms, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches are:</p>.<p>People with vitiligo often have hair that turns gray early.

For some people, the white patches do not spread. But often the white patches will spread to other areas of the body. For some people, vitiligo spreads slowly, over many years. For other people, spreading occurs quickly. Some people have reported more white patches after physical or emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_vitiligo_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The doctor will use a family and medical history, physical exam, and tests to diagnose vitiligo.
