Cunha, DO, FACOE</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_birth_defects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Birth defects are structural or functional abnormalities present at birth that cause physical or mental disability. Some may be fatal. </p>.<p>Researchers have identified thousands of different birth defects. Currently, birth defects are the leading cause of death for infants during the first year of life. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_birth_defects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Birth defects have a variety of causes, such as: </p>.<p>Genetic problems caused when one or more genes doesn't work properly or part of a gene is missing </p>.<p>Problems with chromosomes, such as having an extra chromosome or missing part of a chromosome </p>.<p>Environmental factors that a woman is exposed to during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rubella</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">German measles</a> while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a>, or using <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a> or alcohol during pregnancy.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_different_types_of_birth_defects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two main types of birth defects: structural and functional/developmental. </p>.<p>Structural birth defects are related to a problem with body parts. Some physical problems include cleft lip or cleft palate, heart defects, such as missing or misshaped valves, and abnormal limbs, such as a club foot. They also include neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, problems that are related to the growth and development of the brain and spinal cord. </p>.<p>Functional birth defects are related to a problem with how a body part or body system works. These problems often lead to developmental disabilities and can include things such as: </p>.<p><b>Nervous system or brain problems</b> - such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/learning_disability/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">learning disabilities</a>, mental retardation, behavioral disorders, speech or language difficulties, convulsions, and movement trouble. Some examples of birth defects that affect the nervous system include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Autism</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/down_syndrome_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Down syndrome</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prader-willi_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Prader-Willi syndrome</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fragile_x_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fragile X syndrome</a>. </p>.<p><b>Sensory problems</b> - such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataracts</a> and other visual problems, and varying degrees of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing loss</a> including deafness </p>.<p><b>Metabolic disorders</b> - involve a body process or chemical pathway or reaction, such as conditions that limit the body's ability to get rid of waste materials or harmful chemicals. Two common metabolic disorders are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phenylketonuria/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">phenylketonuria</a> (PKU) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypothyroidism</a>. </p>.<p><b>Degenerative disorders</b>--are conditions that might not be obvious at birth, but cause one or more aspects of health to steadily get worse. For example, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), which was the focus of the movie Lorenzo's Oil, Rett syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and lysosomal disorders are examples of degenerative disorders. </p>.<p>In some cases, birth defects are caused by a combination of factors. Some recognized patterns of birth defects affect many parts or processes in the body, leading to both structural and functional problems. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_birth_defects" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatments for birth defects vary by disorder.
