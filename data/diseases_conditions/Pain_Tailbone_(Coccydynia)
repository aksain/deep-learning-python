<p><b><a name="coccydynia_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Inflammation of the tailbone (coccyx or bony area located deep between the buttocks above the anus) is referred to as coccydynia. Coccydynia is associated with pain and tenderness at the tip of the tailbone between the buttocks. Sitting often worsens coccyx pain.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An injury or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> may cause inflammation of the coccyx, but it may occur seemingly spontaneously. There are many causes of tailbone pain that can mimic coccydynia, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sciatica/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sciatica</a>, infection (including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shingles</a> of the buttocks), pilonidal <span class="CrossLinkHighLight"><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cysts</a></span>, sacroiliitis, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fractured bone</a> (broken tailbone or tailbone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fracture</a>).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_risk_factors_for_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The major risk factor for coccydynia is injury to the coccyx or pelvic bones.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_coccydynia_symptoms_and_signs" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pain and local tenderness that occur at the coccyx are the major symptoms of coccydynia. Tailbone pain can lead to difficulty sitting or leaning against the buttocks. Along with the coccyx pain with sitting, there is typically exquisite pain at the tailbone area.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_doctors_diagnose_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Doctors may diagnose coccyx inflammation based solely on the symptoms and the examination findings of local pain. Other conditions can be excluded by the examination (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_picture_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">shingles</a>, which typically would be associated with local <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>) and other testing (to exclude bone or tissue disorders, such as with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CAT scan</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> scan).</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_medical_treatment_for_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients with coccydynia are advised to use a well-padded seat when sitting and avoid long periods of sitting when possible. If the condition becomes severe or persistently troublesome, then medical attention should be sought to accurately evaluate the cause of the pain, especially if there is associated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">rash</a>.</p>.<p>Rest, avoiding reinjury to the affected area, anti-inflammatory medications, and pain medications can relieve symptoms. Sitting on a pillow, cushion, or buttock support can help. Treatment for patients with persistent coccydynia involves local cortisone injections. This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">corticosteroid</a> shot is simply performed in the doctor's office and can potentially dramatically relieve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic pain</a> and even resolve the symptoms for many. Sometimes, the injection includes fluoroscopy or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>. Physical therapy with exercises can be helpful with a patient's recovery. Rarely, when patients have unrelenting or severe coccyx pain, surgery can be performed on the coccyx to remove the irritated bony prominence.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of people with coccydynia have complete recovery in response to the conservative treatments described above.</p>.<p><b><a name="is_it_possible_to_prevent_coccydynia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Because coccydynia is associated with injury, avoiding trauma to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">coccyx bone</a> is the best method of preventing coccydynia.<span id="cntid"></span><span id="cntid"></span></p>
