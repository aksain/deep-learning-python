 Caregivers are people who take care of other adults, most often parents or spouses, who are ill or disabled. The people who receive care usually need help with basic daily tasks. Caregivers help with many things such as:</p>.<p> 
Usually caregivers take care of elderly people. Less often, caregivers are grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. The terms informal caregiver and family caregiver refer to people who are not paid to provide care. As the American population ages, the number of caregivers and the demands placed on them will grow.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_are_our_nations_caregivers" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>About one in four American families or 22.4 million households care for 
someone over the age of 50. The number of American households involved in 
caregiving may reach 39 million by 2007. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_caregiver_stress" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Caregiver <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> is the emotional strain of caregiving. Studies show that 
	caregiving takes a toll on physical and emotional health. Caregivers are 
	more likely to suffer from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> than their peers. Limited research 
	suggests that caregivers may also be more likely to have health problems 
	like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> than non-caregivers. </p>.<p>Caring for another person takes a lot of time, effort, and work. Plus, most 
caregivers juggle caregiving with full-time jobs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parenting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">parenting</a>. In the process, 
caregivers put their own needs aside. Caregivers often report that it is 
difficult to look after their own health in terms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nutrition</a>, and 
doctor's visits. So, caregivers often end up feeling angry, anxious, isolated, 
and sad. </p>.<p>Caregivers for people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a> (AD) or other kinds of 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dementia</a> are particularly vulnerable to burnout. Research shows that most 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dementia</a> caregivers suffer from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>. Also, studies show that 
the more hours spent on caregiving, the greater the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> and 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>. </p>.<p>Women caregivers are particularly prone to feeling stress and overwhelmed. 
Studies show that female caregivers have more emotional and physical health 
problems, employment-related problems, and financial strain than male 
caregivers. Other research shows that people who care for their spouses are more 
prone to caregiving-related stress than those who care for other family members.
</p>.<p>It is important to note that caring for another person can also create 
positive emotional change. Aside from feeling stress, many caregivers say their 
role has had many positive effects on their lives. For example, caregivers 
report that caregiving has given them a sense of purpose. They say that their 
role makes them feel useful, capable and that they are making a difference in 
the life of a loved one.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_i_tell_if_caregiving_is_putting_too_much_stress_on_me" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>If you have any of the following symptoms, caregiving may be putting too much

Caregivers who work outside the home should consider taking some time off. If 
you are feeling overwhelmed, taking a break from your job may help you get back 
on track. Employees covered under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act may 
be able to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year to care for relatives.
