The priapism erection is not associated with sexual activity and is not relieved by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_health_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">orgasm</a>. It occurs when blood flows into the penis but is not adequately drained.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_priapism" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Common causes of priapism include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_priapism_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for priapism is a medical emergency, because a prolonged erection can scar the penis and result in a long term complication of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_pictures_slideshow_erectile_dysfunction/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">erectile dysfunction</a> if if not treated. The goal of treatment is to relieve the erection and preserve normal penile function. In most cases, treatment involves draining the blood using a needle placed in the side of the penis. Medications that help shrink blood vessels, which decreases blood flow to the penis, also may be used. In rare cases, surgery may be required to avoid permanent damage to the penis. If the condition is due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sickle cell disease</a>, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_transfusion/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood transfusion</a> may be necessary. Treating any underlying medical condition or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">substance abuse</a> problem is important to preventing priapism.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Peyronie's disease is a condition in which a plaque, or hard lump, forms on the penis. The plaque may develop on the upper (more common) or lower side of the penis, in the layers that contain erectile tissue. The plaque often begins as a localized area of irritation and swelling (inflammation), and can develop into a hardened scar. The scarring reduces the elasticity of the penis in the area affected.</p>.<p>Peyronie's disease can occur in a mild form that heals without treatment in 6 -18 months. In these cases, the problem does not progress past the inflammation phase. In severe cases, the disease can be permanent. The hardened plaque reduces flexibility, causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> and forcing the penis to bend or arc during erection.</p>.<p>In addition to the bending of the penis, Peyronie's disease can cause general <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> as well as painful erections. It also can cause emotional distress, and affect a man's desire and ability to function during sex.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_peyronies_disease" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact cause of Peyronie's disease is unknown. In people whose disease develops quickly, lasts a short time, and goes away without treatment, the likely cause is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> (hitting or bending) that causes bleeding inside the penis. However, in some people, Peyronie's disease develops slowly and is severe enough to require surgical treatment. Other possible causes of Peyronie's disease include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_peyronies_disease_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two ways in which Peyronie's disease can be treated: surgery or non-surgical treatment.</p>.<p>Because the plaque of Peyronie's disease often shrinks or disappears without treatment, most doctors suggest waiting one to two years or longer before attempting to correct it with surgery. In many cases, surgery produces positive results. But because complications can occur, and because many of the problems associated with Peyronie's disease (for example, shortening of the penis) are not corrected by surgery, most doctors prefer to perform surgery only on men with curvatures so severe that sexual intercourse is impossible.</p>.<p>There are two surgical techniques used to treat Peyronie's disease. One method involves the removal of the plaque followed by placement of a patch of skin or artificial material (skin graft). With the second technique, the surgeon removes or pinches the tissue from the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which cancels out the bending effect. The first method can involve partial loss of erectile function, especially rigidity. The second method, known as the Nesbit procedure, causes a shortening of the erect penis.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/penile_implants/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Penile implants</a> can be used in cases where Peyronie's disease has affected the man's ability to achieve or maintain an erection.</p>.<p>A non-surgical treatment for Peyronie's disease involves injecting medication directly into the plaque in an attempt to soften the affected tissue, decrease the pain, and correct the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peyronies_disease_curvature_of_the_penis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">curvature of the penis</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_e-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Vitamin E</a> pills haves also been shown to benefit some men with Peyronie's disease.</p>.<p>Another, less invasive option is laser treatment to thin the plaques of Peyronie's disease.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_balanitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Balanitis is an inflammation of the head of the penis. A similar condition, <i>balanoposthitis</i>, refers to inflammation of the head of the penis and the foreskin. Symptoms of balanitis include redness or swelling, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a>, pain and a foul-smelling discharge.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_balanitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Balanitis most often occurs in men and boys who have not been circumcised (had their foreskin surgically removed), and who have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/poor_hygiene/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">poor hygiene</a>. Inflammation can occur if the sensitive skin under the foreskin is not washed regularly, allowing sweat, debris, dead skin and bacteria to collect under the foreskin and cause irritation. The presence of tight foreskin may make it difficult to keep this area clean and can lead to irritation by a foul-smelling substance (smegma) that can accumulate under the foreskin.</p>.<p>Other causes of balanitis may include:</p>.<p>In addition, men with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> are at greater risk for balanitis. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Glucose</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sugar</a>) in the urine that is trapped under the foreskin serves as a breeding ground for bacteria.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_balanitis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for balanitis depends on the underlying cause. If there is an infection, treatment will include an appropriate antibiotic or antifungal medication. In cases of severe or persistent inflammation, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/circumcision_the_medical_pros_and_cons/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">circumcision</a> may be recommended.</p>.<p>Taking appropriate hygiene measures can help prevent future bouts of balanitis, such as retracting the foreskin daily and adequately cleaning and drying the head of the penis. In addition, it is important to avoid strong soaps or chemicals, especially those known to cause a skin reaction.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_phimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is so tight that it cannot be pulled back (retracted) to reveal the head of the penis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_phimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Phimosis, which is seen most often in children, may be present at birth. It also can be caused by an infection, or by scar tissue that formed as a result of injury or chronic inflammation. Another cause of phimosis is balanitis, which leads to scarring and tightness of the foreskin. Immediate medical attention is necessary if the condition makes urination difficult or impossible.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_phimosis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of phimosis may include gentle, manual stretching of the foreskin over a period of time. Sometimes, the foreskin can be loosened with medication applied to the penis. Circumcision, the surgical removal of the foreskin, often is used to treat phimosis. Another surgical procedure, called preputioplasty, involves separating the foreskin from the glans (head of the penis). This procedure preserves the foreskin and is less traumatic than circumcision.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_paraphimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Paraphimosis occurs when the foreskin, once retracted, cannot return to its original location. It is a medical emergency that can cause serious complications if not treated.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_paraphimosis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Paraphimosis may occur after an erection or sexual activity, or as the result of injury to the head of the penis. With paraphimosis, the foreskin becomes stuck behind the ridge of the head of the penis. If this condition is prolonged, it can cause pain and swelling, and impair blood flow to the penis. In extreme cases, the lack of blood flow can result in the death of tissue (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gangrene/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gangrene</a>), and amputation of the penis may be necessary.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_paraphimosis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of paraphimosis focuses on reducing the swelling of the glans and foreskin. Applying ice may help reduce swelling, as may applying pressure to the glans to force out blood and fluid. If these measures fail to reduce swelling and allow the foreskin to return to its normal position, an injection of medication to help drain the penis may be necessary. In severe cases, a surgeon may make small <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cuts</a> in the foreskin to release it. Circumcision also may be used as a treatment for paraphimosis.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_penile_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Penile <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> is a rare form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> that occurs when abnormal cells in the penis divide and grow uncontrolled.
