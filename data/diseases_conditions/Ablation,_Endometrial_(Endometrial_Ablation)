<p><b><a name="endometrial_ablation_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_endometrial_ablation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Endometrial ablation is the surgical destruction of the lining tissues of the uterus, known as the endometrium. Endometrial ablation is one type of treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_endometrial_ablation_done" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Endometrial ablation is a treatment for abnormal bleeding of the uterus that is due to a benign (non-cancerous) condition. It is not a sufficient treatment when bleeding is caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/uterine_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer of the uterus</a>, since <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> cells may have grown into the deeper tissues of the uterus and can't often be removed by the procedure. </p>.<p>Endometrial ablation is only performed on a nonpregnant woman who does not plan to become <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> in the future. It should not be performed if the woman has an active infection of the genital tract. This treatment is not a first-line therapy for heavy bleeding and should only be considered only when medical and hormonal therapies have not been sufficient to control the bleeding.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_endometrial_ablation_performed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prior to the procedure, a woman needs to have an endometrial sampling (biopsy) performed to exclude the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>. Imaging studies and/or direct visualization with a hysteroscope (a lighted viewing instrument that is inserted to visualize the inside of the uterus) are necessary to exclude the presence of uterine polyps or benign tumors (fibroids) beneath the lining tissues of the uterus. Polyps and fibroids are possible causes of heavy bleeding that can be simply removed without ablation of the entire endometrium. Obviously, the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded, and intrauterine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contraceptive</a> devices (IUDs) must be removed prior to endometrial ablation.</p>.<p>Hormonal therapy may be given in the weeks prior to the procedure (particularly in younger women), in order to shrink the endometrium to an extent where ablation therapy has the greatest likelihood for success. The belief is the thinner the endometrium, the greater the chances for successful ablation.</p>.<p>To begin the procedure, the cervical opening is dilated to allow passage of the instruments into the uterine cavity. Different procedures have been used and are all similarly effective for destroying the uterine lining tissue. These include laser beam, electricity, freezing, and heating.</p>.<p>The choice of procedure depends upon a number of factors, including</p>.<p>The type of anesthesia required depends upon the method used, and some endometrial ablation procedures can be performed with minimal anesthesia during an office visit. Others may be performed in an outpatient surgery center.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risks_and_complications_of_endometrial_ablation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Complications of the procedure are not common but may include:</p>.<p>In very rare cases, fluid used to expand the uterus during the procedure can be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fluid in the lungs</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pulmonary edema</a>).</p>.<p>Some women may experience regrowth of the endometrium and need further surgery (see below).</p>.<p>Minor side effects from the procedure can occur for a few days, include cramping (like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual cramps</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frequent_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">frequent urination</a> that may last for 24 hours. A watery discharge mixed with blood may be present for a few weeks after the procedure and can be heavy for the first few days.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_outlook_after_endometrial_ablation" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The majority of women who undergo endometrial ablation report a successful reduction in abnormal bleeding. Up to half of women will stop having periods after the procedure. Yet, studies indicate the rate of failure (defined as bleeding or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> after endometrial ablation that required <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hysterectomy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hysterectomy</a> or reablation) was 16% to 30% at 5 years. Failure was most likely to occur in women younger than 45 years and in women with 5 or more children, prior <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/surgical_sterilization/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tubal ligation</a>, and a history of painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual cramps</a>. After endometrial ablation, 11% to 36% of women had a repeat ablation or other uterine-sparing procedure.</p>.<p>Although the procedure removes the uterine lining and typically results in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a>, it should not be considered as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth control</a> measure, because pregnancy can still occur in a small portion of the endometrium which remains or has regrown. In this case there may be severe problems with the pregnancy, and the procedure should never be performed if the woman may desire pregnancy in the future.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
