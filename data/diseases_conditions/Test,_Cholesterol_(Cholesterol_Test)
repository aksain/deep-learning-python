<p><b><a name="cholesterol_test_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_cholesterol" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat that the body needs to produce important structures and chemicals. It is one of the main components of cell membranes, the outer lining that protects the internal structures that make body cells work and function properly. Cholesterol is also a building block for many of the hormones in the body including mineralocorticoids that control electrolyte levels in the body, glucocorticoids involved in carbohydrate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss_boost_metabolism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a>, and sex hormones including testosterone, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">estrogen</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/progesterone-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">progesterone</a>. Cholesterol is one of the building blocks that assists in forming 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitamin D</a> in the body. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutritional_health_vitamin_d_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Vitamin D</a> is responsible for calcium <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/metabolism_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">metabolism</a> in the body.</p>.<p>There are two important types of cholesterol, <b>high density lipoprotein (HDL)</b> and <b>low density lipoprotein (LDL)</b>. LDL is the bad cholesterol that deposits in arteries when too much is present. HDL is considered the good cholesterol because it can bind to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">LDL cholesterol</a> and return it to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> where it can be removed from the body. </p>.<p>While most of the cholesterol in the body is obtained through the foods we eat, it is also produced in the liver to meet the body's demands. The body attempts to regulate the amount of total cholesterol, but when too much cholesterol is present, the excess can be deposited in arteries throughout the body. This leads to artery narrowing and increases the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attack</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/peripheral_vascular_disease_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">peripheral vascular disease</a>. Elevated LDL levels increase the risk of these diseases, and elevated HDL levels decrease the risk.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_does_a_cholesterol_test_measure" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cholesterol tests are blood tests that measure the amount of cholesterol in the body. The health-care professional may order only a cholesterol test with results showing:</p>.<p>In addition to cholesterol level, the health-care professional also may order a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lipid profile</a> test.  The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lipid</a> profile test will also measure <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/triglyceride_test/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">triglyceride levels</a> and another fatty substance found in the blood.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_i_prepare_for_a_cholesterol_test" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For the best and most accurate results, it is important to fast for many hours before the cholesterol blood test is taken. Each laboratory has its own guidelines for not eating, and the fast may range from 9-16 hours. It is acceptable to drink water.</p>.<p><b><a name="do_i_need_to_call_my_doctor_for_my_test_results" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>It usually takes a day or two from the time the blood is drawn until your 
health-care professional receives the results of the cholesterol test. Ideally, the 
health-care professional will contact you with those results and explain their significance. However, if you have not been contacted in a short period of time, it is reasonable to contact your 
health-care professional and ask for the test results.</p>.<p>There are home cholesterol test kits available that have been U.S. FDA approved, but their accuracy is not necessarily as good as that of a certified laboratory. These tests usually measure total cholesterol only, but some also can measure HDL, LDL and cholesterol. If you use one of the home kits, it is wise to discuss the results with your 
health-care professional.</p>.<p>The purpose of the cholesterol blood test is to determine whether treatment is needed for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_cholesterol_hyperlipidemia_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high cholesterol</a>.
