<p><b><a name="costochondritis_and_tietze_syndrome_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_costochondritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Costochondritis is a common form of inflammation of the cartilage where ribs attach to the breastbone (the sternum). The inflammation can involve multiple cartilage areas on both sides of the sternum but usually is on one side only.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_tietze_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Tietze syndrome is an inflammation of the costochondral cartilages of the upper front of the chest that involves swelling of the joint. Costochondritis is distinguished from Tietze syndrome, a condition also involving <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> in the same area of the front of the chest, by the presence of swelling. Costochondritis is not associated with swelling, as opposed to Tietze syndrome, where swelling is characteristic.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_costochondritis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The causes of costochondritis are not known and may involve several factors. Possible causes include heredity (genetic predisposition), viruses, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a> (injury).</p>.<p>Costochondritis can be an independent health condition by itself or sometimes can be a feature of a more widespread disorder.

Costochondritis is not associated with swelling, as opposed to Tietze syndrome, where swelling is characteristic. Tietze syndrome is an inflammation of the costochondral cartilages of the upper front of the chest that involves swelling of the joint.</p>.<p>While both costochondritis and Tietze syndrome feature symptoms such as localized <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">chest pain</a> and tenderness, Tietze syndrome also causes swelling over the ribs and cartilage near the breastbone (sternum). Signs and symptoms such as redness, tenderness, and warmth can also be present, but a localized swelling is the distinguishing finding. The chest pain is variable, often sharp, can be confused with heart pain or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a>, and can last from hours to weeks. It can cause difficulty with sleeping and even rolling over in bed is sometimes painful.

It is generally best to minimize these activities until the inflammation of the rib and cartilage areas has subsided.</p>.<p>Rest, anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, and cortisone injections have been used by doctors treating the inflammation and chest wall pain of both costochondritis and Tietze syndrome.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_home_remedies_for_costochondritis_and_tietze_syndrome" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Ice packs applied to local swelling can sometimes help to reduce chest pain and inflammation.
