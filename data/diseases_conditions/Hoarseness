<p><b><a name="hoarseness_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_hoarseness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hoarseness is an abnormal change in the voice caused by a variety of 
conditions. The voice may have changes in pitch and volume, ranging from a deep, 
harsh voice to a weak, raspy voice. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_hoarseness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Hoarseness is generally caused by irritation of, or 
injury to, the vocal 
cords. The larynx (also referred 
to as the voice box), is the portion of the respiratory (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a>) tract 
containing the vocal cords. The cartilaginous outer wall of the larynx is 
commonly referred to as the "Adams apple." The vocal cords are two bands of 
muscle that form a "V" inside the larynx. When we sing or 
speak, the vocal cords vibrate and produce sound. </p>.<p><!--START IMAGETAG-->
</p>.<p>Hoarseness can be caused by a number of conditions. The 
most common cause of hoarseness is acute laryngitis (inflammation of the vocal 
cords) caused most often by an

commonly from overuse or misuse of the voice (such as from yelling or singing).

quality, though it may also cause a change in the pitch or volume of the voice. 
The rapidity of onset 
and any associated symptoms will depend on the underlying cause leading to 
hoarseness.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_the_causes_of_hoarseness_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A health care professional will ask the patient questions 
about their hoarseness and any other associated symptoms. A physical exam will 
focus on the head and neck. Often times, a diagnosis can be made based on this 
initial assessment. In some instances, a long lighted flexible tube (fiberoptic 
scope) will be inserted into the throat to directly visualize the vocal cords if no other cause is initially 
identified. Individuals with hoarseness that lasts longer than 2 to 3 weeks should 
have a consultation with an otolaryngologist 
in order to exclude any serious causes of hoarseness.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_hoarseness" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for hoarseness depends on the underlying
