Cunha, DO, FACOEP</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_pubic_lice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Also called crab lice or "crabs," pubic lice are parasitic insects found primarily in the pubic or genital area of humans. Pubic lice infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races, ethnic groups, and levels of society.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_do_pubic_lice_look_like" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pubic lice have forms: the egg (also called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_lice_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nit</a>), the nymph, and the adult.</p>.<p><b>Nit: </b>Nits are lice eggs. They can be hard to see and are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white. Pubic lice nits take about 6-10 days to hatch.</p>.<p><b>Nymph:</b> The nymph is an immature louse that hatches from the nit (egg). A nymph looks like an adult pubic louse but it is smaller. Pubic lice nymphs take about 2-3 weeks after hatching to mature into adults capable of reproducing. To live, a nymph must feed on blood.</p>.<p><b>Adult:</b> The adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a strong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs; their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab. This is how they got the nickname "crabs." Pubic lice are tan to grayish-white in color. Females lay nits and are usually larger than males. To live, lice must feed on blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within 1-2 days.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="where_are_pubic_lice_found" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pubic lice usually are found in the genital area on pubic hair; but they may occasionally be found on other coarse body hair, such as hair on the legs, armpits, mustache, beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Pubic lice on the eyebrows or eyelashes of children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse. Lice found on the head generally <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_lice_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">head lice</a>, not pubic lice.</p>.<p>Animals do not get or spread pubic lice.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_pubic_lice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of pubic lice include:</p>.<p><b><a name="how_did_i_get_pubic_lice" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Pubic lice usually are spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. Pubic lice found on children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse. Occasionally, pubic lice may be spread by close personal contact or contact with articles such as clothing, bed linens, or towels that have been used by an infested person. A common misunderstanding is that pubic lice are spread easily by sitting on a toilet seat. This would be extremely rare because lice cannot live long away from a warm <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_body_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">human body</a> and they do not have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> designed to hold onto or walk on smooth surfaces such as toilet seats.
</p>.<p>Persons infested with pubic lice should be investigated for the presence of other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sexually transmitted diseases</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_a_pubic_lice_infestation_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a "crab" louse or egg (nit) on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body (eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, perianal area, groin, trunk, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a>). Pubic lice may be difficult to find because there may be only a few. Pubic lice often attach themselves to more than one hair and generally do not crawl as quickly as head and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/body_lice_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">body lice</a>. If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits in the pubic area strongly suggests that a person is infested and should be treated. If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is not successful, see a health care provider for a diagnosis. Persons infested with pubic lice should be investigated for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>.<p>Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, a magnifying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lens</a> may be necessary to find lice or eggs.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_pubic_lice_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide can be used to treat pubic ("crab") lice. These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the instructions in the package or on the label.</p>.<p>Lindane shampoo is a prescription medication that can kill lice and lice eggs. However, lindane is not recommended as a first-line therapy. Lindane can be toxic to the brain and other parts of the nervous system; its use should be restricted to patients who have failed treatment with or cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk. Lindane should not be used to treat premature infants, persons with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizure</a> disorder, women who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> or breast-feeding, persons who have very irritated skin or sores where the lindane will be applied, infants, children, the elderly, and persons who weigh less than 110 pounds.</p>.<p>Malathion* lotion 0.5% (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/malathion-topical/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ovide</a>*) is a prescription medication that can kill lice and some lice eggs; however, malathion lotion (Ovide*) currently has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of pubic ("crab") lice.</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ivermectin-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ivermectin</a> has been used successfully to treat lice; however, ivermectin currently has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of lice.</p>.<p><b>How to treat pubic lice infestations:</b> (Warning: See special instructions for treatment of lice and nits on eyebrows or eyelashes.
