<p><b><a name="what_is_cleidocranial_dysplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cleidocranial dysplasia is a condition that primarily affects the development 
of the bones and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a>. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_cleidocranial_dysplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Signs and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia can vary 
widely in severity, even within the same family.</p>.<p>Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia usually have underdeveloped or 
absent collarbones (clavicles). As a result, their shoulders are narrow and 
sloping, can be brought unusually close together in front of the body, and in 
some cases the shoulders can be made to meet in the middle of the body. Delayed 
closing of the spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanels) is also 
characteristic of this condition. The fontanels usually close in early 
childhood, but may remain open into adulthood in people with this disorder.</p>.<p>Affected individuals may be 3 to 6 inches shorter than other members of their 
family, and may have:</p>.<p>Characteristic facial features may include:</p>.<p>Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia may have 
decreased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bone density</a> 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteopenia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteopenia</a>) and may 
develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>, a condition that makes bones progressively more brittle 
and prone to fracture, at a relatively early age. 
Women with cleidocranial dysplasia have an increased risk of requiring a 
cesarean section when delivering a baby, due to a narrow pelvis preventing 
passage of the infant's head.</p>.<p>Dental abnormalities seen in cleidocranial dysplasia may 
include:</p>.<p>In addition to skeletal and dental abnormalities, people 
with cleidocranial dysplasia may have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing loss</a> and be prone to 
sinus and 
ear 
infections. Some young children with this condition are mildly delayed in the 
development of motor skills such as crawling and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a>, but intelligence is unaffected.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_common_is_cleidocranial_dysplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Cleidocranial dysplasia occurs in approximately 1 per million individuals 
worldwide.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_genes_are_related_to_cleidocranial_dysplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The RUNX2 gene provides instructions for making a 
protein that is involved in bone and cartilage development and maintenance. This protein is a transcription 
factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps 
control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that the RUNX2 
protein acts as a "master switch," regulating a number of other genes involved 
in the development of cells that build bones (osteoblasts).</p>.<p>Some mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the RUNX2 
protein. Other mutations introduce a premature stop signal that results in an 
abnormally short protein. Occasionally, the entire gene is missing.</p>.<p>These genetic changes reduce or eliminate the activity of the protein 
produced from one copy of the RUNX2 gene in each cell, decreasing the total 
amount of functional RUNX2 protein. This shortage of functional RUNX2 protein 
interferes with normal bone and cartilage development, resulting in the signs 
and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia. In rare cases, affected individuals may 
experience additional, unusual symptoms resulting from the loss of other genes 
near RUNX2.</p>.<p>In about one-third of individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia, no mutation 
in the RUNX2 gene has been found. The cause of the condition in these 
individuals is unknown.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_people_inherit_cleidocranial_dysplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one 
copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In 
some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. 
Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in 
people with no history of the disorder in their family.</p>.<p><b><a name="where_can_i_find_information_about_treatment_for_cleidocranial_dysplasia" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These resources address the management of cleidocranial dysplasia and may
