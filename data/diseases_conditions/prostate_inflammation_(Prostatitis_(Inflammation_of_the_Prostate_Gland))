It surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine and semen exit the body. Its main function is to produce seminal fluid in order to transport sperm through the urethra.</p>.<p><img alt="Picture of the male reproductive and urinary anatomy" itemprop="image" src="https://images.medicinenet.com/images/illustrations/male_torso.jpg"><span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_prostatitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms associated with prostatitis can vary depending on the underlying cause of prostatitis. The symptoms may appear slowly or come on quickly, and they may improve rapidly (depending on the cause and treatment available) or they may last for several months and they can keep recurring (chronic prostatitis). The rapidity and severity of onset is usually most pronounced with acute bacterial prostatitis. The following are signs and symptoms that may be present with prostatitis:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_prostatitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prostatitis can be caused by bacteria that leak into the prostate gland from the urinary tract (the most common bacterial cause) and from direct extension or lymphatic spread from the rectum. It can also result from various sexually transmitted organisms such as <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Chlamydia trachomatis</a></i>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">HIV</a>. Other organisms responsible for infection are the same found most frequently in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infections</a>, such as <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Escherichia coli</a></i>. In many instances (especially in the chronic form of prostatitis), no specific cause of prostatitis can be found.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_for_prostatitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Men of all ages can be affected by prostatitis, but it is more common in young and middle-aged men. Other risk factors for the development of prostatitis include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_tests_diagnose_prostatitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prostatitis is usually diagnosed by analyzing a urine sample and undergoing an examination of your prostate gland by your health care practitioner. This examination involves a digital rectal examination to palpate the prostate gland and feel for abnormalities of the gland. Occasionally, the physician may also collect and test a sample of the prostatic fluid.</p>.<p>Sometimes a prostate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/massage_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">massage</a> is performed to compare samples of the prostatic fluid both before and after this intervention has been performed. To perform this procedure, the doctor will <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>/massage the prostate gland during the digital rectal examination. Because there is the concern that this procedure can release bacteria into the bloodstream, this test is contraindicated in cases of acute bacterial prostatitis.</p>.<p>Additional tests that may be obtained include a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">complete blood count</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">CBC</a>), an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolyte</a> panel, blood cultures, a swab of urethral discharge if present, and sometimes a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_specific_antigen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">PSA test</a>, which is used as a screening test for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">prostate cancer</a>, may also be elevated with prostatitis.</p>.<p>Other tests that may also be obtained include urodynamic tests (to check how well you empty your bladder and establish if prostatitis is affecting your ability to urinate), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> imaging, computed tomography (CT) imaging, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cystoscopy_and_ureteroscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">cystoscopy</a>, and a prostate biopsy.</p>.<p>If recurring episodes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">urinary tract infections</a> and prostatitis occur, see your doctor for a more detailed evaluation of your genitourinary system for anatomic abnormalities, which may make you more prone to infections.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_treatment_for_prostatitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment for prostatitis depends on the underlying cause and type of prostatitis. Antibiotics are prescribed if the cause is a bacterial infection. All forms of prostatitis require <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> control if needed, treatment, relief of complications and side effects, and closely monitored by your doctor.
