Normally, this muscular valve, or sphincter, functions to keep food and stomach acid from moving upward from the stomach to the esophagus and larynx. This valve opens to allow food into the stomach and closes to keep the stomach's contents from coming back up. The backward movement of stomach contents (gastric contents) up into the esophagus is called gastroesophageal reflux. Moreover, any increase in abdominal pressure (such as obesity or tight clothing, which can push acid back from the stomach up the esophagus) or a person with a hiatal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hernia_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hernia</a> will have an increased risk for reflux. When it causes symptoms or esophageal inflammation it is referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gerd_gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gerd_gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">GERD</a>). When the acid backs up into the voice box (larynx), the condition is referred to as reflux laryngitis.</p>.<p>Stomach acid can cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus, larynx, and throat. This can lead to</p>.<p>Rarely, reflux can lead to cancers of the esophagus or larynx.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_and_signs_of_reflux_laryngitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Heartburn is the most common symptom associated with reflux. The American College of Gastroenterology estimates that more than 60 million Americans experience heartburn at least once a month and some studies suggest that more than 15 million people experience heartburn symptoms each day. The incidence of GERD is on the rise, and the rise in obesity is believed to be a contributing factor. In addition to heartburn, reflux severe enough to cause laryngitis can cause chronic hoarseness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">asthma</a>, or a foreign body sensation in the throat (globus phenomenon). Considering the high prevalence of GERD, reflux laryngitis and its symptoms are uncommon.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_reflux_laryngitis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In most patients, the presumptive diagnosis of reflux laryngitis is based on the typical history of heartburn and hoarseness. Testing usually is reserved for those patients who do not respond to conservative therapy (as explained below) or drug therapy.

Popular choices include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sodium_bicarbonate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">sodium bicarbonate</a> (Alka Seltzer), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcium_carbonate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">calcium carbonate</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcium_carbonate/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Tums</a>, Rolaids, Alka-Mints), and aluminum and magnesium antacids (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aluminum_hydroxide_magnesium_hydroxide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Maalox</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/simethicone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Mylanta</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/magaldrate-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Riopan</a>, Gaviscon). Use antacids 30 to 60 minutes after each meal and at bedtime because they are more effective at these times.</p>.<p>People on a low sodium diet should avoid sodium bicarbonate. Calcium and aluminum can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a>, while magnesium antacids can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>. Patents with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">kidney disease</a> should avoid magnesium and aluminum antacids. Check with your pharmacist or doctor for any interactions with other medications you are taking.<br>Drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), theophylline (Theo-Dur, Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theolair, Uniphyl, Slo-Phyllin), anticholinergics, and calcium channel blockers should be avoided if feasible, but discuss discontinuing any medication with a doctor first.</p>.<p>The acid-blocking drugs (famotidine [Pepcid], cimetidine [Tagamet], nizatidine [Axid], ranitidine [Zantac]) are known as H2-blockers. These are available without a prescription. However, their strength may be inadequate.</p>.<p>Other valuable medications include metoclopramide (Reglan), which helps to empty the stomach more rapidly; or proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid).</p>.<p>If conservative therapy and medical therapy fail, surgery may be necessary. Traditionally, fundoplication, a procedure that serves to strengthen or recreate the muscular valve (lower esophageal sphincter), requires significant surgical work and hospital stay. Surgery or fundoplication also has been able to be done with an endoscope, which shortens the hospital stay and recovery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_difficulties_in_diagnosing_reflux_laryngitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b>In some patients</b> it appears clear that the laryngeal symptoms - hoarseness, cough, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sore throat</a> - are due to reflux, for example, in patients with marked heartburn and regurgitation of acid.</p>.<p><b>In most patients</b> with laryngeal symptoms - those with milder heartburn and no regurgitation who comprise the majority of patients in whom reflux laryngitis is considered - it is not as clear. Examination of the larynx may reveal redness and swelling, but many diseases of the larynx as well as reflux can cause these signs.</p>.<p>There are difficulties with using symptoms to diagnose reflux. For example, cough may occur when there is reflux into the esophagus. Refluxed liquid does not need to reach the larynx.</p>.<p>Finally, it is unclear whether refluxed liquid from the stomach that is not acid can cause reflux laryngitis, and there is no way of testing whether or not non-acid liquid is reaching the larynx. Many physicians use a trial of potent acid-suppression with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/proton-pump_inhibitors/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">PPIs</a> to try to prove that acid reflux is the cause of the laryngeal symptoms. The problem with a trial of PPIs is that some symptoms such as cough and throat clearing can be caused by habit, and the PPIs may have a placebo effect. Thus, a response to PPIs may not be proof that reflux is the cause of symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
