<p><b><a name="clostridium_difficile_c_difficile_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_clostridium_difficile_c_difficile" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>Clostridium difficile</i> (<i>C. difficile</i>) is a bacterium that is related to the bacteria that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tetanus</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/botulism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">botulism</a>. The <i>C. difficile</i> bacterium has two forms, an active, infectious form that cannot survive in the environment for prolonged periods, and an inactive, "noninfectious" form, called a spore, that can survive in the environment for prolonged periods. Although spores cannot cause infection directly, when they are ingested they transform into the active, infectious form.</p>.<p><i>C. difficile</i> spores are found frequently in:</p>.<p>They can be found on:</p>.<p>They even can be carried by pets. Thus, these environments are a ready source for infection with <i>C. difficile.</i></p>.<p><b><a name="what_causes_clostridium_difficile_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Antibiotic-associated (<i>C. difficile</i>) colitis is an infection of the colon caused by <i>C. difficile</i> that occurs primarily among individuals who have been using <a onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');"> antibiotics</a>. <i>C. difficile </i>infections are commonly acquired during hospital stays, infecting approximately 1% of patients admitted to hospitals in the United States. <i>C. difficile </i> may also be acquired in the community, however.</p>.<p>It is the most common infection acquired by patients while they are in the hospital. More than half a million <i>C. difficile</i> infections occur in hospitals in the US each year, with about 300,000 occurring while in the hospital or shortly after hospitalization. After a stay of only two days in a hospital, 10% of patients will develop infection with <i>C. difficile</i>. <i>C. difficile</i> also may be acquired outside of hospitals in the community. It is estimated that about 200,000 infections with <i>C. difficile</i> occur in the community unrelated to hospitalization each year in the U.S.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_clostridium_difficile_cause_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><i>C. difficile</i> spores lie dormant inside the colon until a person takes an antibiotic. The antibiotic disrupts the other bacteria that normally are living in the colon and preventing <i>C. difficile</i> from transforming into its active, disease-causing bacterial form. As a result,<i> C. difficile</i> transforms into its infectious form and then produces toxins (chemicals) that inflame and damage the colon. The inflammation results in an influx of white blood cells to the colon. The severity of the colitis can vary. In the more severe cases, the toxins kill the tissue of the inner lining of the colon, and the tissue falls off. The tissue that falls off is mixed with white blood cells (pus) and gives the appearance of a white, membranous patch covering the inner lining of the colon. This severe form of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis is called pseudomembranous colitis because the patches appear like membranes, but they are not true membranes.</p>.<p>Not everybody infected with <i>C. difficile</i> develops colitis. Many infants and young children, and even some adults, are carriers (they are infected but have no symptoms) of <i>C. difficile. C. difficile</i> does not cause colitis in these people probably because;</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_clostridium_difficile_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients with <b>mild <i>C. difficile</i> colitis</b> may have:</p>.<p>Patients with <b>severe <i>C. difficile</i> colitis</b> may have:</p>.<p>Severe diarrhea also can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a> and disturbances in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrolytes</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">minerals</a>) in the body. Rarely, severe colitis can lead to life-threatening complications such as toxic megacolon (markedly dilated colon), peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdominal), and perforation of the colon.</p>.<p><b><a name="which_antibiotics_cause_clostridium_difficile_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although the antibiotic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clindamycin-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">clindamycin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clindamycin-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cleocin</a>) has been widely recognized as causing <i>C. difficile</i> colitis, many commonly prescribed antibiotics also cause colitis. Examples of antibiotics that <b>frequently cause <i>C. difficile</i> colitis</b> include:</p>.<p>Antibiotics that <b>occasionally cause <i>C. difficile</i> colitis</b> include:</p>.<p>Antibiotics that <b>rarely if ever cause <i>C. difficile</i> colitis</b> include:</p>.<p>In fact, metronidazole and vancomycin are two antibiotics that are used for treating <i>C. difficile</i> colitis; however, there are rare reports of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis occurring several days after stopping metronidazole.</p>.<p>While most <i>C. difficile</i> colitis in the US is caused by antibiotics, <i>C. difficile</i> colitis also can occur in patients without exposure to antibiotics. For example, patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ulcerative colitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Crohn's disease</a> have been known to develop <i>C. difficile</i> colitis without exposure to antibiotics.</p>.<p>Since many antibiotics can cause <i>C. difficile</i> infection, all antibiotics should be used prudently. Self-administration or using antibiotics without an accurate diagnosis or a proper reason should be discouraged. On the other hand, benefits of properly prescribed antibiotics for the right reasons usually far outweigh the risk of developing <i>C. difficile</i> colitis.</p>.<p>Antibiotics can sometimes cause diarrhea that is not due to <i>C. difficile</i> infection. The reason for the diarrhea is not clear. The practical implication is that not all diarrhea associated with antibiotics should be considered to be due to <i>C. difficile</i> and treated as such.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_clostridium_difficile_colitis_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>A history of antibiotic use is important in the diagnosis of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis. Patients taking antibiotics (or recently having taken antibiotics) who develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>, cramps and diarrhea are usually tested for <i>C. difficile</i> infection. However, doctors do not always wait for the appearance of diarrhea to start testing for <i>C. difficile</i> since in rare instances <i>C. difficile</i> can cause abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> and tenderness without diarrhea.</p>.<p>Patients with <i>C. difficile</i> colitis often have elevated white blood cell counts in the blood, and, in severe colitis, the white blood cell counts can be very high (20,000 to 40,000). Patients with <i>C. difficile</i> colitis also often have white blood cells in their stool when a sample of stool is examined under a microscope. Elevated white blood cell counts and white blood cells in the stool, however, only demonstrate that there is colitis and not that the cause of the colitis is <i>C. difficile.</i> More specific tests are necessary to determine whether <i>C. difficile</i> is the cause of the colitis.</p>.<p>The most widely used test for diagnosing <i>C. difficile</i> colitis is a test that detects toxins produced by <i>C. difficile</i> in a sample of stool. There are two different toxins, toxin A and toxin B, both capable of causing colitis. Accurate tests for both toxins are available commercially for use in all laboratories. Unfortunately, like most tests in medicine, these tests for toxins are not perfect; both false positive tests (finding toxins when there is no <i>C. difficile</i>) and false negative tests (not finding toxins when <i>C. difficile</i> is present) can occur. Therefore, other tests such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flexible_sigmoidoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flexible sigmoidoscopy</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colonoscopy</a> often are necessary to look for pseudomembranes that are characteristic of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis.</p>.<p>Flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination in which a doctor inserts a flexible fiberoptic tube with a light and a camera on its end into the rectum and sigmoid colon. (The sigmoid colon is the segment of the colon that is closest to the rectum.) In most patients with <i>C. difficile</i> colitis, the doctor will find pseudomembranes in the rectum and the sigmoid colon. However, some patients with <i>C. difficile</i> colitis will have pseudomembranes only in the right colon (the segment of the colon farthest from the rectum). Patients with pseudomembranes confined to the right colon require colonoscopy in order to see the pseudomembranes. (A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colorectal_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">colonoscope</a> is a longer version of the flexible sigmoidoscope that is long enough to reach the right colon.) </p>.<p>X-ray examinations and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">computerized tomography</a> (CT) examinations of the abdomen will occasionally demonstrate thickening of the wall of the colon due to inflammation, but these X-ray findings also are non-specific and only demonstrate that colitis is present. They do not demonstrate the cause of the colitis, for example, <i>C. difficile.</i></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_clostridium_difficile_colitis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis includes:</p>.<p>In patients with mild colitis, stopping the antibiotic that caused the infection may be enough to cause the colitis and diarrhea to subside. In most cases, however, antibiotics are needed to eradicate the <i>C. difficile</i> bacteria.</p>.<p>Antibiotics that are effective against <i>C. difficile</i> include metronidazole (Flagyl), and vancomycin (Vancocin). These two antibiotics usually are taken orally for 10 days. Both antibiotics are equally effective. With either antibiotic, fever usually will resolve in one or two days, and diarrhea in three or four days. Several other antibiotics, some new and some older, have been used effectively against <em>C. difficile</em> recently, most notably fidaxomicin (Dificid).</p>.<p>The choice of which antibiotic to use depends on the individual patient's situation and the preferences of the treating doctor. Some doctors will prescribe metronidazole first because it is much less expensive than vancomycin. Vancomycin may be reserved for patients who do not respond to metronidazole, are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic</a> to metronidazole, or develop side effects from metronidazole. Other doctors will prescribe vancomycin first for severe colitis because vancomycin can achieve much higher antibiotic levels in the colon than metronidazole (and higher antibiotic levels theoretically would be more effective in killing bacteria).</p>.<p><b><a name="why_are_there_relapses_of_clostridium_difficile_colitis" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Approximately 10% to 20% of successfully treated patients can experience a relapse of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis with recurrence of diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>. Relapses typically occur days or even weeks after treatment is stopped. Some patients may experience several relapses. </p>.<p>The most likely explanation for relapse is that the <i>C.difficile</i> has not been completely eradicated by the initial course of antibiotics. <i>C. difficile</i> in its active bacterial form is killed by either metronidazole or vancomycin, but the spores are resistant to killing. Several days after stopping antibiotics, the surviving spores transform into active bacterial forms which will multiply and produce toxins again.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_are_relapses_of_clostridium_difficile_colitis_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment options for relapses of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis include:</p>.<p>Doctors usually treat patients who relapse with another 10 or 14 day course of metronidazole or vancomycin, and a majority of the patients so treated will recover. Nevertheless, some patients will have another relapse.Treatment options for multiple relapses include:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_new_in_clostridium_difficile" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prevalence of <i>C. difficile</i> infection has been increasing steadily particularly in the elderly. There have been reports from several hospitals of a newer, more virulent strain of <i>C. difficile</i> bacteria that produces large amounts of both toxins A and B and as well as a third toxin. This strain produces more severe colitis than the usual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strains</a>. Patients infected by this strain are more seriously ill, require surgery more frequently, and die from the infection more frequently than patients infected with the usual <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid_pictures_slideshow_bumps_bruises_sprains/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strains</a>. Currently, the commercially available diagnostic tests cannot distinguish this strain from the usual strains.</p>.<p>Traditionally, antibiotic use is often considered the most important factor for the development of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis. Increasingly though doctors are diagnosing <i>C. difficile colitis</i> in patients without previous antibiotic exposure. This is especially true in patients with Crohn's disease or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ulcerative colitis</a>. In one study of 92 patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ulcerative colitis</a> and Crohn's disease relapse, 10 patients tested positive for <i>C. difficile</i>.Another change that is occurring with <i>C. difficile</i> infection is that it is no longer restricted to patients in hospitals or nursing homes. A study of data from 2009 through 2011 found community-associated <i>C. difficile</i> infections represent about one third of all <i>C. difficile</i> colitis cases. Traditionally, antibiotic use is often considered the most important factor for the development of <i>C. difficile</i> colitis, but in this study, 36% of the patients had not been treated with antibiotics.</p>.<p>Doctors are witnessing increasing difficulty in treating <i>C. difficile</i> colitis. Firstly, resistance to metronidazole is on the rise. Secondly, colitis (along with symptoms of diarrhea and cramps) is taking longer to resolve and may require higher doses of vancomycin. Thirdly <i>C. difficile</i> colitis relapse (with recurrent diarrhea) is common. More troublesome still, many patients experience multiple relapses, often requiring prolonged (months) antibiotic (such as vancomycin) treatment.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
