In rare cases, chronic cough may be the result of inhaling foreign objects into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> (usually in children). It is important to see a doctor who may order a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_x-ray/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chest X-ray</a> if a chronic cough is present.

Examples include:</p>.<p>The treatment of chronic cough is directed at the cause. Symptoms may be relieved with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) cough medicines containing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guaifenesin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">guaifenesin</a> and/or dextromethorphan (these can be found as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=165214" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="itn">cough syrups</a> in tablet form).</p>.<p>The following are treatments for chronic cough caused by medications, conditions, or diseases.</p>.<p>In severe cases of chronic cough a health-care professional may prescribe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/codeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">codeine</a> or other similar narcotic medications, which are effective as cough suppressants.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><strong>Infections: </strong>Bacterial pneumonia and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">bronchitis</a> are typically treated with antibiotics such as cephalosporins, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azithromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">azithromycin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azithromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zithromax</a>), and other antibiotics. If the pneumonia is close to the chest wall inflammation of the surface of the lung can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>, known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pleurisy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pleurisy</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pain</a> relievers (analgesics) can be helpful. Cough suppressants are used with caution in these situations because clearing the lung of the infected mucus by coughing helps clear the infection. Most bronchitis in adults is caused by viral infections. Therefore, treatment is much the same as that of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">common cold</a> including rest, fluids, pain relievers, and humidification. Some people find expectorant cough medicines containing guaifenesin helpful in alleviating their discomfort. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate a viral bronchitis from a bacterial bronchitis, and antibiotics are prescribed. In some cases, asthmatics can produce green mucus that looks infected. Your doctor can have the mucus examined to determine if an infection is present.</p>.<p><strong>Medications: </strong>Patients with chronic cough who are taking <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a> medicines called ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme), for example, enalapril (Vasotec), captopril (Capoten), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lisinopril/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">lisinopril</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lisinopril/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Zestril</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lisinopril/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Prinivil</a>), etc. should talk to their doctor about switching medications. Patients should not stop taking medicine on their own because a marked elevation in blood pressure can result from discontinuation. Discuss any possible medicaion changes with your doctor.

If cough is severe, a person may be seen in a hospital's emergency department by an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emergency medicine</a> specialist.</p>.<p>People suffering from constant cough may be referred to different specialists depending on the underlying cause. A pulmonologist is a lung specialist who treats diseases of the airways. An allergist is an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> specialist who may treat chronic cough due to allergies. Gastroenterologists specialize in diseases of the digestive tract and can treat chronic cough due to conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD). Cardiologists specialize in diseases of the heart and circulatory system and may treat persistent cough that can be a secondary symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
