<p><b><a name="overactive_bladder_oab_facts" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_an_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition that is characterized by sudden, involuntary contraction of the muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder. This results in a sudden, compelling need to urinate that is difficult to suppress (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_urgency/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">urinary urgency</a>), even though the bladder may only contain a small amount of urine. The key symptom is sudden urge to void (urgency) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, often associated with urinary frequency (voiding 8 or more times per day) and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to void). Irritating fluids, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">caffeinated</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">beverages</a> (coffee, tea), spicy foods, and alcohol can worsen the symptoms. It is common for those affected to compensate for OAB by toilet mapping, fluid restriction, and timed voiding. There is no pain, burning, or blood in the urine with OAB.</p>.<p>Overactive bladder coupled with urinary leakage (inability to suppress the urge to void) is also referred to as urgency urinary incontinence. Another common type of urinary incontinence is called stress incontinence, which is caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a> in the pelvic floor muscles that surround and support the bladder and urethra. The symptom of stress incontinence is leakage when <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">coughing</a>, straining, jumping, or with other physical activity that increase the pressure in the abdomen (Valsalva). Treatment for stress incontinence is very different than urge incontinence. In some individuals, there can be a combination of urge and stress incontinence (mixed incontinence). Often, the most bothersome condition is treated first in individuals with mixed urinary incontinence. In general, urinary incontinence is more common in women compared to men.</p>.<p>The overall prevalence of overactive bladder is 13.9%, affecting men and women with equal frequency. Although it can happen at any age, overactive bladder is especially common in older adults. Overactive bladder should not be considered a normal part of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">aging</a>. The prevalence under the age of 50 is &lt; 10%. After age 60, the prevalence increases to 20%-30%. It is estimated that 60% of patients have dry OAB (no leakage) while 40% have wet OAB.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_causes_of_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Overactive bladder is typically caused by early, uncontrolled contraction (spasms) of the bladder muscle (detrusor muscle), resulting in an urge to urinate. Overactive bladder is primarily a problem of the nerves and muscles of the bladder that allow for early contraction during the normal relaxation phase of bladder filling. The bladder's contraction in response to filling with urine is one the steps in the normal process of urination. The contraction and relaxation of the detrusor muscle is regulated by the nervous system. Approximately 300 cc of urine in the bladder can signal the nervous to trigger muscles of the bladder to coordinate urination. Voluntary control of the sphincter muscles at the opening of the bladder can hold the urine in the bladder for longer. Up to 600 cc of urine can be contained in a normal adult bladder. For those with OAB, the bladder capacity is typically low (&lt; 200cc).</p>.<p>Overactive bladder typically results from inappropriate contraction of the detrusor muscle regardless of the amount of urine. The most common form of OAB is idiopathic, where the exact cause is not known. However, OAB can result from problems of the nervous system.</p>.<p>The common abnormalities of the nervous system that cause overactive bladder are</p>.<p>Other causes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/overactive_bladder_oab_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">OAB symptoms</a> include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary tract infection</a>, bladder stones, urethral strictures, benign prostatic enlargement (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benign_prostatic_hyperplasia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">BPH</a>), or bladder tumors.</p>.<p>Frequently, no apparent cause of overactive bladder can be determined (idiopathic overactive bladder).<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_any_risk_factors_for_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the common risk factors for overactive bladder include the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_overactive_bladder_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The symptoms of an overactive bladder include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frequent_urination/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">frequent urination</a> (urinating eight or more times per day), urgency of urination (sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to urinate). Overactive bladder may cause significant social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, sexual, and financial problems. Again, these symptoms should not be considered a normal part of aging.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_do_health-care_professionals_diagnose_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The diagnosis of overactive bladder is based on the presence of symptoms, while excluding other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. This is based on history, physical examination, and a urine test. Waking up to urinate one or more times at night, urinary frequency (urinating at least eight times daily), urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence are all important clues in evaluating someone suspected of having overactive bladder.</p>.<p>In addition to a general physical examination, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_exam/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">pelvic exam</a> in women (to assess for dryness, atrophy, inflammation, infection, stress incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse [seeing a bulge in the vagina particularly with increasing abdominal pressure by straining]) and a prostate examination in men (to assess for size, tenderness, texture, and/or masses) are helpful in excluding other contributing conditions.</p>.<p>Urine analysis (UA) to assess for infection, blood cells in the urine, and high levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">glucose</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sugar</a>) in the urine is recommended. Occasionally, urine cytology (to look for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> cells in the bladder) is sometimes advised in individuals undergoing evaluation of urinary incontinence and overactive bladder, particularly individuals with blood cells in the urine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_urine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hematuria</a>). Bladder <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a> measurement of the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination (called post-void residual) may also provide additional information about the cause of urinary incontinence (obstruction to urine flow or weak bladder muscle) but is not needed in all individuals with OAB symptoms.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_treatments_for_an_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The treatment for overactive bladder can vary with each individual. Guidelines suggest starting with less invasive therapies first. The recommended first line of therapy is behavioral, dietary, and lifestyle therapies. In some individuals, the addition of biofeedback is helpful. Biofeedback may be done in the office or by a physical therapist. In those individuals who do not respond adequately to behavioral, dietary, or lifestyle therapies, the addition of medications (pharmacologic therapy) is recommended as a second-line treatment. Third-line therapies consist of less-invasive surgical options (injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder wall) and electrical stimulation therapies, including sacral neuromodulation (Interstim) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PTNS). More extensive surgical therapies are available but are rarely needed for treatment of OAB that is not the result of a nervous system condition.</p>.<p>Here are commonly recommended treatments.</p>.<p><b>Dietary and Lifestyle</b></p>.<p><b>Behavioral</b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_role_of_medications_in_treating_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are several medications recommended for the treatment of overactive bladder. Using these medications in conjunction with behavioral therapies has shown to increase the success rate for the treatment of overactive bladder.</p>.<p>The main goals of OAB treatment are to</p>.<p>Typically, the medications for overactive bladder start to work within one to two weeks, and optimal relief of OAB symptoms is usually achieved by six weeks. The most common medications (anticholinergics), bladder relaxants, target to decrease the overactivity of the detrusor muscle. Anticholinergics should be used under the direction of the physician prescribing them. They may have some common side effects, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry mouth</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">constipation</a>, facial flushing, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blurred_vision/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blurry vision</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">confusion</a> (in the elderly). There are multiple anticholinergic therapies approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. They all are similar in their ability to treat the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/overactive_bladder_oab_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">symptoms of overactive bladder</a> but differ in the frequency and type of side effects as well as method of use. Some are once daily, some are topical treatments applied to the skin, and some come in different doses, allowing one to increase the dose if needed. Lastly, several of these medications are now available in generic forms.</p>.<p>Contraindications: The use of anticholinergics in individuals with narrow-angle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a> is not recommended without approval from an eye specialist. The side effects of anticholinergic medications for OAB may be increased with the use of other medications, thus it is important to always review current medications with the prescribing physician prior to starting an anticholinergic.</p>.<p>Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is considered a third-line therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder and is used in individuals who have tried and failed and/or cannot tolerate the side effects of medical therapy and/or has contraindications to the use of medications to treat overactive bladder.</p>.<p>Another third-line therapy is neuromodulation.</p>.<p>Neuromodulation is a newer method of treating overactive bladder with electrical stimulation that results in reorganization of the spinal reflexes involved in bladder control. There are two types of neuromodulation available: percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and sacral neuromodulation (Interstim). PTNS is performed in the office and is usually performed once a week for 12 weeks with periodic therapies thereafter to maintain a response. It involves placing a small needle into the area near the ankle and administering electrical stimulation. Sacral neuromodulation is usually performed in two stages. The first stage involves the placement of wires (leads) into areas in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sacrum</a> and then using a small generator to test the response to stimulation. If there is a 50% or more improvement in symptoms the wires (leads) are internalized and an internal generator is placed, typically under the skin near the buttocks.</p>.<p>Surgery is rarely necessary in treating overactive bladder unless symptoms are debilitating and unresponsive to other treatments. Reconstructive bladder surgery (cystoplasty) is the most common surgical procedure. This surgery involves enlarging the size of the bladder by using part of the intestine.</p>.<p><b><a name="are_there_alternative_therapies_for_oab" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There is limited information on the effects of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acupuncture/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">acupuncture</a> on OAB symptoms. However, small studies have demonstrated improvements in OAB symptoms.</p>.<p>Select herbal therapies have also demonstrated improvement in OAB symptoms in small studies.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_treatments_for_the_chronically_incontinent" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Although many people will improve their continence through medications, pelvic-muscle exercises, and bladder training, some will never achieve complete dryness. Sometimes treatment failures are due to concurrent use of other necessary medications, such as diuretics (water pills that increase urination), that actually can cause incontinence. Others may have dementia or other physical impairments that keep them from being able to perform pelvic-muscle exercises or retrain their bladders. Many will be cared for in long-term care facilities or at home. The following recommendations can help keep the chronically <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence_in_women_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">incontinent</a> drier and reduce their cost of care:</p>.<p><b><a name="what_measures_can_be_taken_at_home_to_prevent_overactive_bladder_symptoms" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The exact cause of overactive bladder syndrome is not known, thus preventative strategies are not established. However, the following options can avoid exacerbating symptoms in some individuals.</p>.<p>Caffeine may exacerbate urinary urgency, and it is potentially an irritant to the bladder. Eliminating caffeine intake can diminish some of the symptoms of overactive bladder.</p>.<p>Some experts suggest that avoidance of certain foods, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chocolate_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">chocolate</a>, spicy foods, alcohol, carbonated beverages, and nuts, can be beneficial in preventing symptoms of overactive bladder. Others encourage increasing the amount of dietary fiber for people with overactive bladder. Limiting fluid intake can also help to reduce urinary frequency.</p>.<p>Excess weight can put more pressure on the bladder, causing urinary incontinence. Therefore, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">weight loss</a> can also help with urinary incontinence in general.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_some_of_the_complications_of_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Common complications that can result from overactive bladder include</p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_overactive_bladder" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The overall prognosis for overactive bladder is generally good. Through a combined approach of behavioral modifications and medications, the patient can help significantly improve bladder urgency, and the quality of life of those affected by overactive bladder can substantially improve.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
