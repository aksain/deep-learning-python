<p>Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in which the electrical signals are generated chaotically throughout the upper atria (chambers) of the heart. Many people with this condition have no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). It is the most common supraventricular tachycardia.</p>.<p>The heart has four chambers (The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles.); 1) the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">right atrium</a> (upper right); 2) the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">left atrium</a> (upper left); 3) the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">right ventricle</a> (lower right); and 4) the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/heart_detail_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">left ventricle</a> (lower left). Blood returning to the heart from the body contain low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide. This blood flows into the right <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_flutter/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atrium</a> and then down into the adjacent right ventricle. After the right ventricle fills, contraction of the right <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_fibrillation_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atrium</a> pumps additional blood into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a> where the blood takes up oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. The blood then flows from the lungs to the left atrium, and then down into the adjacent left ventricle. Contraction of the left atrium pumps additional blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the aortic artery and then to rest of the body via the vascular system. The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles. The ventricles must deliver enough blood to the body for the body to function normally. The amount of blood that is pumped depends on several factors. The most important factor is the rate of contraction of the heart (the heart rate). As the rate increases, more blood is pumped. The heart pumps more blood with each beat when the atria contract and fill the ventricles with additional blood just before the ventricles contract.</p>.<p>With each beat of the heart, an electrical discharge (current) passes through the electrical system of the heart. This discharge causes the muscle of the atria and ventricles to contract and pump blood.</p>.<p>The electrical system of the heart consists of the SA node (sinoatrial node), the AV node (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">atrioventricular node</a>), and special tissues in the atria and the ventricles that conduct the current.</p>.<p>The electrical discharges from the SA node cause the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The same discharges then pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles, traveling through the special tissues of the ventricles and causing the ventricles to contract. In a normal heart, the rate of atrial contraction is the same as the rate of ventricular contraction.</p>.<p>At rest, the frequency of the discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate in individuals that are in good clinical health.</p>.<p>Many patients with this condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic), and are unaware of the abnormal rhythm. When symptoms do occur, the most common one is heart <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/palpitations/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">palpitations</a>, an uncomfortable awareness of the rapid and irregular heartbeat. Other symptoms of the condition are caused by the diminished delivery of blood to the body. These symptoms include:</p>.<p>There are many risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation. They include:</p>.<p>About 1 in 10,000 in otherwise good health, young adults have the disease without any apparent cause or underlying cardiac problems. Atrial fibrillation of the heart in these individuals usually is intermittent, but can become chronic in 25%. This condition is referred to as lone AFib. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Stress</a>, alcohol, tobacco, or use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">stimulants</a> may play a role in causing this <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arrhythmia_irregular_heartbeat/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arrhythmia</a>.</p>.<p>Atrial fibrillation can be chronic and sustained, or brief and intermittent (paroxysmal). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refers to <strong>intermittent episodes of AF</strong> lasting, for example, minutes to hours. The rate reverts to normal between episodes. In chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation, the atria fibrillate all of the time. <strong>Chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation</strong> is not difficult to diagnose. Doctors can hear the rapid and irregular heartbeats using a stethoscope. Abnormal heartbeats also can be felt by taking a patient's pulse and by a doctor's diagnosis.</p>.<p>The treatment of atrial fibrillation is multi-faceted and involves:</p>.<p>An important first step in the treatment of AF is to uncover and correct health conditions (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">hyperthyroidism</a> or use of stimulant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a>) that can cause the disease. These steps include:</p>.<p>Having excluded or corrected the factors that cause the disease, the next step is when the ventricles are beating too rapidly, usually is to slow the rate at which the ventricles beat.</p>.<p>A person with the disease and healthy AV nodes usually have ventricles that beat rapidly. Drugs are necessary to slow down the rapid heart rate. Drugs to slow the heart rate include:</p>.<p>These medications slow the heart rate by retarding conduction of the electrical discharges through the AV node. These medications, however, do not usually convert AFib back into a normal rhythm. Other drugs or treatments are necessary to achieve a normal heart rhythm and improve health.</p>.<p><b>Benefits of controlling the rate:</b> In patients with rapid ventricle contractions as a result of the disease, slowing the rate of ventricular contractions improves the heart's efficiency in delivering blood (by allowing more time between contractions for the ventricles to fill with blood) and relieves the symptoms of inadequate flow of blood -- dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath.</p>.<p>With chronic, sustained disease, doctors may decide to leave some patients in atrial fibrillation if their heart rates are under control, the output of blood from the ventricles is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned to prevent strokes. This form of treatment is called rate control therapy (discussed in this article).</p>.<p><b>Limitations of medications for controlling the heart rate:</b> In people with diseased AV nodes, ventricular contractions may be slower than in those who have normal AV nodes. Moreover, some elderly individuals with atrial fibrillation are extremely sensitive to medications that slow the rate of ventricular contractions, usually because of a diseased AV node. In these patients, the heart rate can become dangerously slow with small doses of medications to slow the heart. This condition is referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, or "sick sinus syndrome." Patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome need medications to control the fast heart rate and a pacemaker to provide a minimum safe rate.</p>.<p>Drugs used in slowing atrial fibrillation generally cannot convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. Therefore, these patients are at risk for the formation of blood clots in the heart and strokes and will need prolonged blood thinning with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anticoagulants_drug_class_of_blood_thinners/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">anticoagulants</a> like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">warfarin</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Coumadin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Jantoven</a>).</p>.<p>The complications of cardioversion include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a> of the skin, and in rare instances, death. However, these problems are very uncommon.</p>.<p>Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion. Cardioversion usually is attempted with drugs first. If medications fail, electrical cardioversion can be considered. Sometimes a doctor may choose to use electrical cardioversion first if AF is of short duration (onset within 48 hours) and the transesophageal echocardiography shows no blood clots in the atria.</p>.<p>Cardioversion is performed urgently (on an emergency basis) on patients with severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms caused by AFib. For example, some patients with rapid AF can develop chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness or fainting. (Chest pain in these patients is due to an insufficient supply of blood to the heart muscles. Shortness of breath indicates ineffective pumping of blood by the ventricles. Fainting or dizziness usually is due to dangerously <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a>.)</p>.<p>Recent studies have shown that an acceptable alternative to cardioversion (chemical or electrical) is rate-control therapy. In this therapy, the doctor will leave the patients in AF provided their rate of ventricular contractions is under good control, the output of blood from the heart is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned by warfarin to prevent strokes. Heart rate in these patients can be controlled using medications such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin or AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation. Rate-control therapy is used to simplify therapy and avoid the side effects of anti-arrhythmic medications (medications used to treat and prevent atrial fibrillation).</p>.<p>Over long periods of observation, patients treated with rate-control therapy have similar survival and quality of life as compared to those who undergo repeated electrical or chemical cardioversions.</p>.<p>Suitable candidates for rate-control therapy include:</p>.<p>Before prescribing medications for cardioversion, the doctor usually controls the rate of ventricular contractions and thins the blood, usually with warfarin.</p>.<p>Drugs used in cardioversion usually work by blocking the channels in the walls of cells through which ions travel (sodium channels, potassium channels, beta adrenergic channels, and calcium channels). Some examples of these medications include:</p>.<p>These drugs are capable of converting AFib to normal rhythm in about 50% of patients. They often are used long term to maintain a normal rhythm, and prevent recurrences of AFib, and increase the person's health.</p>.<p>Drugs used for converting atrial fibrillation carry a small risk of causing other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abnormal heart rhythms</a> -- they are said to be proarrhythmic -- especially in patients with diseases of the heart muscle or coronary arteries. These abnormal heart rhythms can be more life threatening than atrial fibrillation. Therefore, treatment with these medications often is initiated in the hospital while the patient's rhythm is continuously monitored for 24 to 72 hours.</p>.<p>These medications may not be effective in the longer term. Many patients eventually develop a recurrence of atrial fibrillation despite the medications.</p>.<p>Drugs used in treating atrial fibrillation often have important side effects. Many patients discontinue them because they cannot tolerate these side effects. For example:</p>.<p>The most severe side effect of amiodarone is lung toxicity that potentially can be fatal. Because of this lung toxicity, patients should report any symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cough</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, or painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> to their doctors.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p>Other methods of converting AFib to a normal rhythm include electrical cardioversion and rate control therapy.</p>.<p>Electrical cardioversion is a procedure used by doctors to convert an abnormal rhythm (such as AFib) to a normal rhythm (sinus rhythm). Electrical cardioversion requires the administration of an electrical shock over the chest. This electrical shock stops the abnormal electrical activity of the heart for a brief moment and allows the normal rhythm to take over. Although electrical cardioversion can be used to treat almost any abnormal fast heartbeat (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_flutter/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atrial flutter</a> and ventricular tachycardia), it is used most frequently to convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm.</p>.<p>Warfarin usually is given for 3 to 4 weeks prior to cardioversion to minimize the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">stroke</a> that can occur during or shortly after cardioversion. Warfarin is continued for 4 to 6 weeks after successful cardioversion. For some patients requiring urgent electrical cardioversion, warfarin may not work fast enough to thin the blood. Therefore, these patients may be given <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heparin-injection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">heparin</a> prior to electrical cardioversion. Heparin is a faster-acting blood thinner than warfarin, but it must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion or as injections under the skin. After successful cardioversion, these patients can be switched from heparin to warfarin.</p>.<p><b>Method of cardioversion</b></p>.<p><b>Effectiveness of electrical cardioversion</b></p>.<p><b>Limitations of electrical cardioversion</b></p>.<p>The risks of electrical cardioversion include stroke, burns of the skin, and in rare instances, death.

Indications should be discussed with the patient's doctor.</p>.<p>Converting to a normal rhythm can be accomplished with medications (chemical cardioversion) or by electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion). Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic sustained Afib undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion, chemical or electrical. Successful cardioversion can alleviate symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, improve quality of life, and lower the risk of strokes. Doctors usually attempt medical cardioversion first, and, if medications fail, then try electrical cardioversion.</p>.<p>Patients who are more likely to attain and maintain a normal rhythm with either chemical or electrical cardioversion include patients:</p>.<p>After successful cardioversion, many patients (up to 75%) may experience recurrence of AFib within 12 months. Therefore, many patients will need long-term treatment with medications to prevent a recurrence of the disease; however, medication(s) are effective only 50% to 75% of the time in preventing recurrence. Moreover, many people cannot tolerate the side effects of long-term medication. For these reasons, several procedures have been developed to treat and prevent recurrence of the condition to return the person to good health; they include:</p>.<p>Ablation of the AV node is a procedure that destroys the AV node so that the atrial electrical discharges cannot pass through the AV node to activate the ventricles. The procedure usually is performed in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiac_catheterization/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">cardiac catheterization</a> unit or an electrophysiology unit of a hospital.</p>.<p>Permanent pacemakers are battery-operated devices that generate electrical discharges that cause the heart to beat more rapidly when the heart is beating too slowly. Recent studies suggest that some patients with recurrent paroxysmal AFib can benefit from the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Although the reasons for this benefit are unknown, regular electrical pulses from the pacemakers may prevent the recurrence of AFib. Furthermore, newer pacemakers that can stimulate two different sites within the atria (dual site atrial pacing) may be even more effective than standard pacemakers in preventing AFib. Nevertheless, permanent pacemaker implantation cannot be considered as standard non-medication treatment for atrial fibrillation.</p>.<p>Implantable atrial defibrillators can detect and convert atrial fibrillation back to a normal rhythm by using high-energy shocks. By detecting atrial fibrillation and terminating it quickly, doctors hope that these devices will prevent recurrences of AFib over the long term.</p>.<p>Atrial defibrillators are surgically implanted within the chest under local anesthesia. These devices deliver high-energy shocks to the heart that are somewhat painful. Atrial defibrillators are not useful in patients with chronic sustained atrial fibrillation and are suitable only for patients with infrequent episodic attacks of AFib.</p>.<p>Many doctors believe that the atria cannot fibrillate if they are sectioned into small pieces so that the conduction of the electrical current through the atria is interrupted. During the Maze procedure, numerous incisions are made in the atria to control the irregular heartbeat and restore a regular rhythm.</p>.<p>The four pulmonary veins are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. There is a narrow band of muscle cells that surrounds the openings of the pulmonary veins where they enter the left atrium. This band of muscle cells may begin to actively discharge electrically, and this discharge may initiate atrial fibrillation. During pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the band of muscle cells is destroyed by energy applied through a catheter. This effectively blocks the electrical discharges from crossing over from the band to the left atrium and hence, prevents atrial fibrillation.</p>.<p>Before PVI, the doctor performs a history and physical examination, an EKG, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and a transesophageal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/echocardiogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">echocardiogram</a> to exclude blood clots in the atria, and, sometimes, a CAT scan of the chest. The doctor also may ask the person to stop certain medications, particularly blood thinners such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">aspirin</a>, clopidogrel (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clopidogrel/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Plavix</a>), or warfarin, several days before the procedure. The doctor may check a blood prothrombin time and INR level to make sure that blood clotting is adequate for the procedure.</p>.<p>PVI is usually performed under deep conscious sedation (but occasionally general anesthesia) in a cardiac electrophysiology laboratory and takes 3 to 6 hours. Several catheters are inserted through large veins (in the neck, arm, or groin) and fed into the left atrium under X-ray (fluoroscopy) guidance. One of the catheters is equipped with an ultrasound transducer that allows the doctor to view the structures inside the heart during the procedure. The junction of the pulmonary veins with the left atrium is identified, and energy is then applied through another catheter to this area. This results in the destruction of the band of muscle cells and their replacement by a scar. This process is repeated at the opening of each of the four pulmonary veins into the left atrium.</p>.<p><b>Course after pulmonary vein isolation:</b> After PVI, patients remain in the hospital telemetry unit so that the heart's rhythm can be monitored.</p>.<p>Many patients will experience AFib and palpitations (irregular heartbeat) while in the hospital and during the first 2 or 3 months following PVI. Therefore, they are given medications such as amiodarone to prevent episodes of AFib and anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin to prevent strokes. The palpitations and episodes of AFib gradually decrease. By 3 months after the procedure, the majority of patients will have a normal rhythm, return to good health, and the doctor may stop warfarin and amiodarone.</p>.<p>Patients usually will have an EKG and a CAT scan of the chest 3 months after PVI. The CAT scan is done to make sure that there is no narrowing of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein stenosis) due to the scarring.</p>.<p><b>Effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation: </b>PVI in the U.S. is a relatively new procedure. When performed by experienced doctors, PVI can be expected to prevent AFib in 70% to 80% of patients during the first year. Some patients may need additional PVI procedures to prevent further atrial fibrillation episodes. Because this procedure is new, it is difficult to know whether successfully treated patients will continue in a normal rhythm for a prolonged period.</p>.<p>Generally, good candidates for PVI include:</p>.<p>When performed by doctors experienced in PVI, the procedure is safe. The risks of pulmonary vein isolation include cardiac tamponade (bleeding into the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart), narrowing of the openings of the pulmonary veins, injury to the phrenic nerve that controls the function of the diaphragm, injury to peripheral blood vessels, and, in rare cases, death.</p>.<p>In the early years of PVI, doctors were trying to destroy the tissues inside the pulmonary veins. This led to narrowing (due to scarring) of the pulmonary veins which, in turn, led to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pulmonary hypertension</a>, a condition in which the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood pressure</a> in the pulmonary veins and arteries increases. Pulmonary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypertension</a> is a serious condition that can lead to congestive heart failure and even death. Doctors no longer try to destroy tissue inside the pulmonary veins. Instead, they try to destroy the tissues only at the junction of the pulmonary veins and the atria. The current technique is not only safer, but is more effective and simpler.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
