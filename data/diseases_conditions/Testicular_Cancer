Davis, MD, PhD</a></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Testicular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.</p>.<p>The testicles are 2 egg-shaped glands located inside the scrotum (a sac of loose skin that lies directly below the penis). The testicles are held within the scrotum by the spermatic cord, which also contains the vas deferens and vessels and nerves of the testicles.</p>.<p>The testicles are the male sex glands and produce testosterone and sperm. Germ cells within the testicles produce immature sperm that travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and larger tubes into the epididymis (a long coiled tube next to the testicles) where the sperm mature and are stored.</p>.<p>Almost all testicular cancers start in the germ cells. The two main types of testicular germ cell tumors are seminomas and nonseminomas. These 2 types grow and spread differently and are treated differently. Nonseminomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. Seminomas are more sensitive to radiation. A testicular tumor that contains both seminoma and nonseminoma cells is treated as a nonseminoma.</p>.<p>Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men 20 to 35 years old.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="health_history_can_affect_the_risk_of_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include:</p>.<p><b><a name="signs_and_symptoms_of_testicular_cancer_include_swelling_or_discomfort_in_the_scrotum" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by testicular cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>.<p><b><a name="tests_that_examine_the_testicles_and_blood_are_used_to_detect_find_and_diagnose_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used:</p>.<p><b><a name="after_testicular_cancer_has_been_diagnosed_tests_are_done_to_find_out_if_cancer_cells_have_spread_within_the_testicles_or_to_other_parts_of_the_body" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.</p>.<p>The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:</p>.<p>Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during follow-up as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.</p>.<p>Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:</p>.<p>When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">metastasis</a>. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">primary tumor</a>) and travel through the lymph system or blood.</p>.<p>The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="the_following_stages_are_used_for_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. All tumor marker levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia.</p>.<p>In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IS and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.</p>.<p>Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.</p>.<p>Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.</p>.<p><i>or</i></p>.<p>Cancer:</p>.<p>Tumor marker levels may range from normal to high.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_recurrent_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Recurrent testicular cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back many years after the initial cancer, in the other testicle or in other parts of the body.</p>.<p><b><a name="there_are_different_types_of_treatment_for_patients_with_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.</p>.<p>Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment.</p>.<p>For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:</p>.<p>For seminoma, all of the following must be true:</p>.<p>For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:</p>.<p>For seminoma, all of the following must be true:</p>.<p>For nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true:</p>.<p>There is no poor prognosis grouping for seminoma testicular tumors.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="five_types_of_standard_treatment_are_used" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Surgery to remove the testicle (inguinal orchiectomy) and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging. Tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery.</p>.<p>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>.<p>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>.<p>The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer.</p>.<p>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">drugs</a> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</p>.<p>Surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred (come back). In surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule.</p>.<p>High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stem_cells/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Stem cells</a> (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="patients_may_want_to_think_about_taking_part_in_a_clinical_trial" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.</p>.<p>Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.</p>.<p>Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.</p>.<p>Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>.<p>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.</p>.<p><b><a name="follow-up_tests_may_be_needed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.</p>.<p>Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.</p>.<p>Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. A patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away.</p>.<p>Long-term clinical exams are very important. The patient will probably have check-ups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_by_stage" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of stage 0 may include the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.</p>.<p>Treatment of stage I testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.</p>.<p>Treatment of seminoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.</p>.<p>Treatment of stage II testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.</p>.<p>Treatment of seminoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.</p>.<p>Treatment of stage III testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.</p>.<p>Treatment of seminoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="treatment_options_for_recurrent_testicular_cancer" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment of recurrent testicular cancer may include the following:</p>.<p>Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.</p>.<p><b><a name="certain_factors_affect_prognosis_chance_of_recovery_and_treatment_options" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:</p>.<p>Testicular cancer can usually be cured in patients who receive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">adjuvant chemotherapy</a> or radiation therapy after their primary treatment.</p>.<p>Certain treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility that may be permanent. Patients who may wish to have children should consider sperm banking before having treatment. Sperm banking is the process of freezing sperm and storing it for later use.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
