<p><b><a name="what_is_eyelid_surgery_blepharoplasty" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> lift, or blepharoplasty, is a procedure to remove skin and to add or remove fat from the eyelids. The term "eyelid lift" is a misnomer because the eyelid is not truly lifted during surgery.</p>.<p>Upper blepharoplasty surgery uses incisions to allow for removal of skin and fat. A thin stitch is then used to bring the skin together to allow for a creation of an eyelid crease.</p>.<p>Lower eyelid surgery can involve skin incisions directly below the lash line or an incision on the inside of the eyelid, called a transconjunctival approach. The transconjunctival approach allows for access to the eyelid without visible incisions, making this technique perfect for patients who need fat removed or added. This approach can be combined with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/laser_resurfacing/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">laser resurfacing</a> of the eyelid skin to reduce lines and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wrinkles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">wrinkles</a>.</p>.<p><b><a name="why_is_eyelid_surgery_performed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Upper eyelid excess skin and fat can create a heavy looking eyelid, aged appearance, puffiness, and sometimes block the upper field of vision. Upper blepharoplasty is performed to remove excess skin and fat and can improve the field of vision.</p>.<p>Double eyelid surgery, also called Asian eyelid surgery, is performed to create or enhance an upper eyelid crease. This type of surgery is performed on Asian people to "westernize" the appearance of the eyelid.</p>.<p>Lower blepharoplasty can be performed to remove excess skin and improve the contour of the eyelid by adding or removing fat. Sometimes tightening the eyelid is needed to correct sagging, while laser skin resurfacing can be used to improve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wrinkles_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">wrinkles</a> and skin texture.</p>.<p><b><a name="who_is_a_good_candidate_for_eyelid_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Those individuals with realistic expectations who are in good health are suitable for eyelid surgery.<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_does_one_prepare_for_eyelid_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Prior to eyelid surgery, the patient should have a detailed examination and discussion about blepharoplasty and potential risks and benefits associated with the procedure. The patient should follow the doctor's preoperative instructions carefully and thoroughly review the postoperative instructions before the day of surgery. This will allow the patient to have any medications for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> relief or necessary items such a gel packs, artificial tears, and gauze at home prior to their return from surgery.</p>.<p>A physical may be required to have your medical doctor "clear" you for surgery if intravenous sedation or general anesthesia is used.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_long_is_the_recovery_time_for_eyelid_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Patients usually have a short recovery time after blepharoplasty. Although <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bruising</a> and swelling is usually worse on the day after surgery, they quickly begin to disappear. During the first 48 hours, the use of cool compresses can greatly reduce <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/easy_bruising/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bruising</a> and swelling around the eyes and face. Light activity such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">walking</a> will also help speed healing. Thin bandages are usually placed over the incision sites and removed in several days, while the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stitches/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">stitches</a> can remain in the skin for about a week. Sometimes self-absorbing stitches are used that do not require removal.</p>.<p>Most people return to normal activities after seven to 10 days following blepharoplasty. By two weeks after eyelid surgery, the majority of the bruising and swelling will resolve.</p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_potential_risks_and_complications_of_eyelid_surgery" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>As with any surgery, there are potential risks and complications of blepharoplasty.

This must be documented during an examination with formal visual field testing and photographs. Some insurance carriers require submission of the visual fields and photographs before approving the blepharoplasty as a medically indicated procedure.<span id="cntid"></span></p>
