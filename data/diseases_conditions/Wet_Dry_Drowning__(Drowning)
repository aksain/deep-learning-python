<p><b><a name="drowning_facts_and_prevention" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_drowning_and_what_are_the_statistics" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>According to WHO, "Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from 
submersion/immersion in liquid." The possible outcomes of drowning are 
classified as death, morbidity (the development of disability or injury), and no 
morbidity. </p>.<p>This simple definition was agreed upon at the 2002 World Congress 
of Drowning held in Amsterdam. Prior to that meeting, some definitions and 
classifications of drowning were not necessarily well defined, and their 
meanings were subject to a variety of interpretations by different countries and 
health organizations. While some people still try to sort drowning events into 
categories (for example wet vs. dry, primary vs. secondary, fatal vs. non-fatal), 
these terms may or may not adequately describe a patient's situation, the 
effects of drowning on their body, or the potential outcome. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_happens_during_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Drowning occurs when water comes into contact with the 
larynx (voice box). 
</p>.<p><b><a name="does_the_type_of_drowning_matter" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There have been a variety of theories reported regarding the potential 
responses of the body to different drowning situations. Most discuss dry vs. wet 
drowning and salt vs. fresh water drowning. </p>.<p><b><a name="wet_vs_dry_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most drownings are unwitnessed, and the victim is found floating. While only 
a small amount of aspirated water is required to cause significant problems with 
lung function, it is the prolonged submersion time and lack of breathing that 
causes complications due to hypoxemia. </p>.<p>Approximately 10% to 20% of drowning victims have dry drowning with no water 
found in the lungs at 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autopsy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autopsy</a>, but even most 
wet drowning victims have less than 4cc/kg of water found in their lungs. For a 
50 pound child, this amounts to less than 3 ounces of water. </p>.<p><b><a name="salt_vs_fresh_water_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>In the lung, the breathing tubes (trachea, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bronchi</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/bronchioles_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bronchioles</a>) branch into 
smaller and smaller segments until they end in an air pocket called an alveolus 
(plural alveoli). This is the part of the lung where air and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a> in 
capillary blood vessels come near enough to allow the transfer of oxygen and 
carbon dioxide between the two. Alveoli are covered with a chemical called 
surfactant that allows the air pocket to open and close easily when breathing 
occurs. </p>.<p>When fresh water enters an alveolus, it destroys the surfactant and causes the alveoli to collapse, unable to open with breathing. A mismatch can develop where blood is pumped to parts of lung where no oxygen is available to be absorbed.  This may lead to a decrease in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_foods_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">concentration</a> of oxygen in the blood called a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. </p>.<p>Salt water doesn't destroy surfactan; rather it washes it away and damages 
the membrane between the alveolus and the capillary blood vessel. One again, the 
body sends blood flow to areas of the lung that aren't able to provide it 
oxygen, and hypoxemia occurs. </p>.<p>Regardless of the type of water, lung function is compromised because of the 
lack of surfactant, and the effect it has on lung function. In some circumstances, 
electrolyte abnormalities may occur with fresh 
water drowning. <span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_risk_factors_of_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>There are two peak ages for drowning: children aged younger than 4 and young 
adults aged 15 to 25. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The consequences and symptoms of drowning vary widely. A drowning victim may show no 
symptoms and have no complaints, or may be found dead. </p>.<p>It is the rare person who is found thrashing in water. Instead, most 
drownings are unwitnessed and the person is found floating or submerged in the 
water. </p>.<p>For those who are alive, they may be anxious, confused, and short of breath. 
Again, it is the function of the brain and lungs that are the main concerns in 
drowning victims. </p>.<p>Young children may have a mammalian diving reflex that occurs when drowning 
occurs in very <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> water. When suddenly 
immersed in cold water less than 68 F (20 C), the victim can stop breathing, slow 
their heart rate dramatically, and shunt all the blood flow to the heart and 
brain. Though not common, these children may be resuscitated and return to 
normal function. Cases have been reported of survival, even after being 
underwater for an hour. </p>.<p><b><a name="when_should_one_seek_medical_care_for_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>All individuals who are victims of drowning, even if they have no symptoms, should be evaluated by a health care professional. Sometimes, subtle information will be revealed that may make the diagnosis of an underlying medical condition.</p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_drowning_diagnosed" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The initial evaluation of any drowning victim will begin with a history of 
the events. </p>.<p>Physical examination will begin with taking and monitoring the vital signs (the ABCs will be 
evaluated - <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">airway</a>, breathing, and circulation). Careful examination of the whole 
body will be required, especially focusing on the neurological examination to 
assess brain function. Lung and heart examination will also be performed. </p>.<p>If trauma or a diving injury is a consideration, the neck and spine may be 
immobilized to protect against potential spinal cord damage. </p>.<p>Laboratory and X-ray testing will be utilized depending upon the situation 
and potential injuries.
<span id="cntid"></span></p>.<p><b><a name="how_is_drowning_treated" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Treatment begins at the water's edge. The American Heart Association 
recommends that if possible, one person is sent to activate Emergency Medical 
Services and call 911. Another is sent to bring an 
automatic external 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/implantable_cardiac_defibrillator/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">defibrillator</a> (AED) to the victim's side. </p>.<p>If no pulse can be identified and the patient is not breathing, CPR should be 
started. Drowning is one of the special situations where hands-only CPR is NOT 
indicated. If there is a potential for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/whiplash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">neck injury</a>, special care needs to be 
taken to prevent further injury to the victim by keeping the neck and body in 
alignment.</p>.<p>If the patient is breathing but not awake, they should be placed on their 
side in the rescue position to prevent aspiration if <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> should occur. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_are_the_complications_of_drowning" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p><b><a name="how_can_drowning_be_prevented" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>Most drownings are preventable, and simple steps can be taken to help with 
water safety. </p>.<p><b><a name="what_is_the_prognosis_for_a_drowning_victim" class="bookmark"></a></b></p>.<p>The prognosis for many drowning victims is poor. The brain does not tolerate 
lack of oxygen well and the amount of potential damage is dependent upon the 
time the patient spends hypoxemic in the water. </p>.<p>Even if the brain survives, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may 
cause significant short and long-term problems as the lungs try to recover from 
their injuries. </p>.<p>The key to the treatment of drowning is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prevention</a>. <span id="cntid"></span></p>
