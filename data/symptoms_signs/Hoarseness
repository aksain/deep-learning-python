<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hoarseness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hoarseness</a> is a harsh, rough, 
raspy quality to the voice. 
Hoarseness is generally caused by irritation of, or injury to, the vocal cords. This <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> to the vocal cords leads to a change in the pitch of the voice. The voice box, or larynx, is the portion of the respiratory (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a>) tract 
containing the vocal cords that produce sound. It is located between the 
pharynx and the trachea. The larynx, also called the voice box, is a 
2-inch-long, tube-shaped organ in the neck.</p>.<p><img width="307" height="324" alt="Thyroid Glad Illustration - Voice Box" src="https://images.medicinenet.com/images/illustrations/thyroid_gland.gif" border="0"></p>.<p>We use the larynx when we breathe, talk, or swallow. Its 
outer wall of cartilage forms the area of the front of the neck referred to as 
the "Adams apple." The vocal cords are two bands of muscle that form a "V" inside the larynx. </p>.<p>
Hoarseness can be caused by a number of conditions. The most common cause of hoarseness is inflammation of the vocal cords from virus infection related to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">common cold</a> or upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/upper_respiratory_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">respiratory infection</a>. Hoarseness can also be caused by bacterial infection, overuse of the voice (such as from yelling and voice abuse or singing),
