Swelling of the breast can occur as a response to infections or other causes of fluid buildup in the breast tissue. Less commonly, breast cancers can cause breast swelling, particularly the type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a> known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_breast_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inflammatory breast cancer</a>. In this case, there is usually associated warmth, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or tenderness, and redness of the breast.  Breast swelling can also be due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lymphedema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymphedema</a>, or the buildup of lymphatic fluid in tissues. This can happen when there is blockage of the lymphatic drainage system, such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a> of the armpit (axilla).  Infections are another cause of swelling that can affect the breast, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mastitis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mastitis</a> (inflammation of the breast tissue) or breast <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_problems_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abscess</a>. In healthy women, breast swelling (of both breasts) may occur in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">premenstrual</a> phase and during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> and lactation. </p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>
