<p></p>.<p>Particularly in the early stages, symptoms of pregnancy can vary among women. 
And while the absence of menstrual periods is the classic and hallmark <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> 
symptoms, there are many other changes in the body, even during early pregnancy 
that result in characteristic signs and symptoms. </p>.<p>
A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/missed_menstrual_period/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">missed period</a> is the hallmark sign of pregnancy. Missing a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual period</a> is typical, although many women report having  light bleeding or spotting bleeding at the time of the expected period, a phenomenon that has been referred to as "implantation bleeding." If this bleeding occurs and is mistaken for a light menstrual period, it's possible for a woman not to realize that she is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a>.</p>.<p>Most of the early symptoms of pregnancy develop over the first two to eight weeks. 
Common symptoms can include breast swelling and tenderness. Food cravings, while 
typical of later pregnancy stages, can also begin in the early weeks of 
pregnancy. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/early_pregnancy_symptoms_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Morning sickness</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, which can occur at any time 
of day and not just in the morning) usually begins in the second to eighth week of 
pregnancy. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tiredness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mood swings</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, and frequent need to urinate are 
all symptoms that can begin early in pregnancy. </p>.<p>Changes in skin color can include a darkening of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nipple</a> area and facial 
skin color changes. The so-called "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/early_pregnancy_symptoms_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mask of pregnancy</a>" is sometimes seen, 
particularly in darker-skinned women, in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/first_trimester_4_weeks_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">first trimester</a>. Medically known as 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melasma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">melasma</a> or chloasma, this is a darkening of the skin on the forehead, bridge of 
the nose, upper lip, or cheeks that usually occurs on both sides of the face.
</p>.<p>As the pregnancy progresses, symptoms can occur that are related to the size 
of the growing uterus. Some women report pressure or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain in the lower back</a> and 
swelling of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> and ankles. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frequent_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Frequent urination</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn_reflux/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heartburn</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">indigestion</a> 
are common in later <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stages of pregnancy</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sleep</a> disturbances and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> can make 
this time period more difficult. </p>.<p>As the delivery date nears, most women experience what are known as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/braxton_hicks_contractions/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Braxton-Hicks contractions</a> of the uterus. Believed to occur as a preparation for 
labor, these contractions manifest as a tightening feeling in the uterus that 
occurs sporadically. Unlike regular labor, Braxton-Hicks contractions do not 
occur at regular intervals and are shorter in duration and less intense than 
labor pains.</p>.<p>
Pregnancy is caused by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fertilization</a> of an egg by sperm and implantation of the resulting fertilized egg in the uterus.
