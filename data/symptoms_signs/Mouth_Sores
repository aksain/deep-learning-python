Sores or localized abnormalities inside the mouth can arise from a number of causes. Mouth sores can occur on the tongue, gums, lips, or inside the cheeks. They may appear as ulcers or red or white patches in the mouth. Bleeding may sometimes occur if ulceration is severe. Bite injuries to the tongue or inside of the cheek are a common cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mouth_sores/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mouth sores</a>. Also commonly, mouth sores represent aphthous ulcers, also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/canker_sores/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">canker sores</a> or aphthous stomatitis. These shallow, painful mouth ulcers often occur in susceptible individuals during times of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, infection, or changes in immune status. Certain medications (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">methotrexate</a> [<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/methotrexate/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Trexall</a>]) can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/cold_sore_and_canker_sore_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">canker sores</a> as well as deficiencies in some B

However, irritation, injury, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">burns</a>, or infection of any of the tissues in the oral cavity can also lead to mouth sores. Sores in the mouth can occur with certain systemic (affecting multiple locations within the body) diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Crohn's disease</a>,
