Cold sensations to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a> can come from poor circulation, disorders of the nervous system, cold exposure injuries such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frostbite/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">frostbite</a>, and decreased metabolism from a low thyroid condition (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypothyroidism</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">underactive thyroid</a>). Depending upon the cause of the symptoms, coldness in the feet can be accompanied by other symptoms, including pain, numbness, changes in skin color, or a pins and needles tingling sensation. Other diseases that can cause cold feet symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arteriosclerosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peripheral_vascular_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">peripheral vascular disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/raynauds_phenomenon/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Raynaud's phenomenon</a>, and neuropathy of any cause.</p>.<p>In people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes mellitus</a>, chronic abnormally elevated blood and urine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sugar</a>, causes narrowing of arteries and capillaries that impair blood supply to tissues leading to cold feet symptoms. Arteriosclerosis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/peripheral_vascular_disease_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">peripheral vascular disease</a> result from chronic elevation of blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cholesterol levels</a> that leads to blood vessel narrowing. Raynaud's phenomenon features narrowing of tiny blood vessels as a reaction to nerve sensitivity to cold exposure, which causes cold feet symptoms. Frostbite causes permanent damage to blood vessels that are injured from freezing of tissues.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
