Hemolysis is the destruction of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a>. Hemolysis can occur due to different causes and leads to the release of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemoglobin</a> into the bloodstream. Normal red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a lifespan of about 120 days. After they die they break down and are removed from the circulation by the spleen. In some medical conditions, or as a result of taking certain medications, this breakdown of red blood cells is increased. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Red cells</a> may break down due to mechanical damage, such as from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">artificial heart</a> valves or heart-lung bypass; or they may be destroyed due to defects in the cells themselves. Medications that have been associated with hemolysis include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acetaminophen</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/penicillins-injection/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">penicillin</a>, and other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> medications. 
<i>Hemolytic anemia</i> is the term used to refer to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> caused by the excess destruction of red blood cells. </p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
