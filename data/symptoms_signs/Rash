<p></p>.<p>The word "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a>" means a change in the color and texture 
of skin that usually causes an outbreak of red patches or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bumps</a> on the skin. In common usage of the term, a "rash" can refer to many different <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_conditions_picture_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">skin conditions</a>. A rash can be caused, directly or indirectly, by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. 
Alternatively, a rash may be unrelated to an infectious organism, such as from 
an underlying medical illness. Medications, chronic medical conditions, and 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> reactions (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hives/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hives</a>) are among the multiple different causes of rash.</p>.<p>

Doctors use specific terms to describe rashes. A macular rash refers to flat, small red patches on the skin, while a papular rash refers to small raised red <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid_pictures_slideshow_bumps_bruises_sprains/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bumps</a>. If both 
rash symptoms and signs are present, a rash is called maculopapular. Scaling, blister formation, or ulceration of the skin 
may be present with a rash. A rash with accompanying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blisters_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blisters</a> is termed a 
vesicular rash. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Itching</a> (pruritus) may or may not accompany a rash.
