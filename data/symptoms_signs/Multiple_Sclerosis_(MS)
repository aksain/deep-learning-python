<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ms_multiple_sclerosis_symptoms_and_treatments/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Multiple sclerosis symptoms</a> vary widely, and a description of "typical"
symptoms is difficult. All the symptoms involve changes in neurologic 
functioning, but there are striking differences among patients in the type, 
severity, and frequency of these symptoms. Different disease patterns such as 
relapsing-remitting (RR), primary-progressive (PP), secondary-progressive (SP), 
and progressive-relapsing (PR) classify the condition according to the 
development and progression of symptoms over time. Relapsing-remitting (RR) 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a> is the most common type, in which symptoms (exacerbations of 
the condition) are followed by periods of time with reduced or no symptoms. 
These relatively symptom-free periods, known as remissions, can last for days or 
for many years. </p>.<p>Some cases of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a> are so mild that the condition is difficult to diagnose. In other cases, there is a gradual decline in functioning through the years, and early signs and symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">multiple sclerosis</a> may be difficult to appreciate.  In very rare cases, symptoms can be so severe and rapidly progressing 
as to be fatal within a short time (known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">malignant</a> or fulminant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MS</a>). 
Symptoms can be related to one body part or may involve multiple areas of the 
body. They may be of short duration or may persist for a long time. Some 
symptoms of multiple sclerosis are mild and cause inconvenience; others may be 
severe and debilitating. </p>.<p>Visual disturbances can be the first early symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MS</a> in some people. The vision changes can 
include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blurred_vision/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blurred vision</a>, distortions, or 
loss of vision in one eye. The vision 
symptoms can be accompanied by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eye pain</a>. Other symptoms can include tingling, 
numbness, prickling <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">muscle spasms</a> in the arms and legs that may occur 
at one or multiple sites. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Weakness</a> in the arm and leg muscles may occur, and 
this can sometimes affect balance and posture, causing clumsiness or lack of 
coordination. Other symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>, 
difficulties with speech, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremors</a>, heat intolerance, and loss of 
sensation. Sexual dysfunction and loss of bladder or bowel control can develop 
in more serious cases. </p>.<p>Mental changes can also occur as symptoms of multiple sclerosis. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Memory loss</a>, 
decreased ability to concentrate, attention deficits, an inability to perform 
sequential tasks, and changes in judgment have all been reported. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Depression</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder_overview_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mania</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/paranoia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">paranoia</a>, and uncontrollable urges to laugh or weep are other symptoms 
that have been described.</p>.<p>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">MS</a> is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the myelin sheath (protective covering) of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The exact reason that the autoimmune reaction occurs is not understood, but both genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role.
