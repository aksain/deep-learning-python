Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by an infection with one of several 
members of the <i>Enterovirus</i> family of viruses. The most common cause is 
Coxsackievirus A16; Enterovirus 71 is also a possible cause. The viruses are 
spread from person to person by direct contact with the infecting virus. The 
viruses are most commonly found in the nasal and throat regions but also in the 
blister fluid or stool of infected individuals. The virus can survive on 
surfaces such as desktops, faucets, etc., and can be transferred by touching 
contaminated, unwashed surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes 
before washing your hands. Changing diapers from an infected infant without 
wearing gloves or proper hand washing can transmit disease. Water contaminated 
with the virus is another way to spread the infection.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
