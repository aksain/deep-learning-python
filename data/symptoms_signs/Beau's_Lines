Beau's lines are horizontal or transverse depressions in the nail (they can be seen in the fingernails, thumbs, toenails, or all nails) that may be confused with  
nail ridging. This phenomenon was originally described in 1846 by the French physician Joseph Honor√© Simon Beau. These 
lines are caused by diseases that affect the entire body, including malnutrition, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attack</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">myocardial infarction</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> diseases, severe infections (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mumps/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mumps</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">measles</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pneumonia</a>, and others), and metabolic disturbances, including poorly controlled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>. However, Beau's lines can result from any disease process or illness that is severe enough to affect the growth plate of the nail.

The timing of the disease can be estimated by measuring the distance from the Beau's line to the nail bed.
