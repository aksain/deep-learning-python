<p></p>.<p>There are many types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alopecia</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">baldness</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hair loss</a>), each with a different cause. Alopecia may be localized to the front and top of the head, as in common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/male_pattern_baldness_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">male pattern baldness</a>. It may be patchy, as in a condition called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alopecia_areata/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alopecia areata</a>. Or it can involve the entire head, as in alopecia capitis totalis (also called alopecia totalis), and it can involve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hair loss</a> of the entire body, such as in alopecia universalis. Alopecia can be caused by medications, such as from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a> for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>. It can also be a result of an underlying disease, such as with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">underactive thyroid</a> gland (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypothyroidism</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>. Alopecia may have no symptoms other than the loss of hair, or it can be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a>.</p>.<p>
The word <i>alopecia</i> comes from the Greek <i>alopex</i> for "fox." Foxes are less furry when afflicted with a skin disease (the "mange") that causes them to lose their hair. When a fancier word for "baldness" was sought, the mangy fox supplied it -- "alopecia" or, if you wish, "fox-mange" -- not a very positive image to associate with baldness!
