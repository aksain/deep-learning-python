A tic is a repetitive and spasmodic contraction of the muscles, usually of the face. It appears as an uncontrollable movement of the body and  may be referred to as a twitch, spasm, motor tic, or jerk. Examples may include blinking the eyes, grimaces, grunts, groans, tongue clicking, throat clearing, or twitching the nose. Tics can also occur outside the facial muscles in the arms or legs, but this is less common. In contrast to motor tics described above, vocal tics are repeated sounds or words that occur without intention. Tics are more common in children than adults, and boys are more commonly affected than girls. Tics can be suppressed if a person concentrates on suppressing them, but this becomes increasingly difficult with time. Tics are a characteristic symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tourette_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tourette syndrome</a> and tic disorders, but they may also occur due to other medical conditions.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
