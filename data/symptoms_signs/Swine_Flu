In certain cases, people have developed the swine flu infection when they are closely associated with pigs, such as farmers or pork processors. Modern flu outbreaks that have occurred due to flu viruses that contain genes from swine and other types of flu viruses have been referred to as swine flu.  Most recently, the 2009 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swine_flu/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">H1N1</a> influenza outbreak was due to a virus that was a mix of swine, human, and avian influenza viruses. In 2011, a new swine flu virus was detected, H3N2 influenza.</p>.<p>
Symptoms of swine flu are similar to those caused by any influenza virus and include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chills</a>, body <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aches</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cough</a>, and nasal secretions. The first symptoms usually appear about 
one to four days after infection, with an average of two days. The symptoms last about 
one to two weeks and can last longer in some cases.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
