The mucus buildup in the lungs leads to repeated infections with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a>, production of thick sputum, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shortness of breath</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/wheezing/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wheezing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nasal_congestion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nasal congestion</a>, and a decreased tolerance for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> or physical activity.

	Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CF gene on chromosome 7. The protein coded by the CF gene is known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The defect in the CFTR protein leads to disruption of chloride channels on cells, which in turn causes the production of abnormal mucus secretions.
