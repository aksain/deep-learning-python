Some of the signs 
and symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Crohn's disease</a> include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>, pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, and other symptoms.

The cause of Crohn's disease is poorly understood.  An abnormal activation of the immune system is believed to play a role in the development of the ulcerations in the digestive tract. Genetic factors that may be involved in the cause of Crohn's disease are under study.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
