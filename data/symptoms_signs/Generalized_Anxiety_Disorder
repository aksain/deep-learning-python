<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Generalized anxiety disorder</a> often occurs together with other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mental health</a> conditions. Sometimes, symptoms of one disorder may overlap with those of another disorder, or the disorders may be co-morbid (both present at the same time). Examples of conditions with symptoms that may overlap with those of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">GAD</a> include

The exact cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/generalized_anxiety_disorder_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">generalized anxiety disorder</a> is unknown, but it is likely that a combination of factors are involved in the cause. These could include both genetic (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inherited</a>) and environmental factors.
