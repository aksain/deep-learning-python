Loss of vision can occur suddenly or develop gradually over time. Vision loss may be complete (involving both eyes) or partial, involving only one eye or even certain parts of the visual field. Vision loss is different from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a> that was present at birth, and this article is concerned with causes of vision loss in an individual who previously had normal vision.
