Urinary urgency is the sudden urge to urinate, due to involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle. Urinary urgency is one of the hallmark <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">symptoms of urinary tract infection</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">UTI</a>) and can be related to other conditions as well. Certain medications, like diuretics, can also cause urinary urgency.

Urinary urgency is related to and often accompanied by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frequent_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary frequency</a>, the need to urinate frequently.
