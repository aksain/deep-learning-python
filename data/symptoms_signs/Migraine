Symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">migraine</a> come from specific physiologic changes that occur within the brain that cause the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> and associated symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">migraine</a>. Migraine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a> are often associated with sensitivity to light, sound, and smells. They may be preceded by an aura, a perceptual change that occurs prior to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>. The aura may take the form of visual changes, such as partial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_floaters/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seeing spots</a> or blind spots with a zigzag border. Alterations in smell or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a> can also signify an aura. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Hallucinations</a>, feelings of prickly skin, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a> can also be signs of an aura. Auras usually occur 15-20 minutes prior to a migraine attack and are present in only 15%-20% of migraine sufferers.</p>.<p> 
The head <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> of migraine can be severe and debilitating. It is sometimes described as throbbing or pulsing. It is usually on one side of the head. Sensitivity to light (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/photophobia/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">photophobia</a>), sound, or smells may accompany the head <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> are other common symptoms. Less common symptoms can include speech disturbances, numbness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eye pain</a>. Migraine symptoms tend to worsen with physical activity.</p>.<p>
A prodrome (group of symptoms that precedes a condition) can occur in the days prior to migraine. Symptoms of this prodrome can include</p>.<p>
The specific cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">migraines</a> is unknown. One possibility is that they may be related to fluctuations in certain levels of neurotransmitters, chemicals that send messages between brain cells.
