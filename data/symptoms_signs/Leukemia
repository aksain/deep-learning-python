<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Leukemia</a> is actually a group of different <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancers</a> of the blood cells. Leukemias can be acute or chronic, and people with chronic leukemias may not notice any symptoms before the condition is diagnosed with a blood test. Acute leukemias are more likely to cause symptoms. Symptoms of all forms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">leukemia</a> are related to the proliferation of abnormal blood cells and replacement of the bone marrow by the cancerous cells.</p>.<p>

The exact cause of leukemia is not known, but both genetics and environmental factors are believed to play a role. Leukemia cells have acquired DNA mutations that allow them to grow abnormally and lose functions of typical white blood cells. Certain factors, such as exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a>, are known to increase the risk of developing leukemia.
