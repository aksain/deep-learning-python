A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chalazion/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chalazion</a> is a lump in the upper or lower <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eyelid</a> caused by inflammation of a gland of the lid. The swelling or lump may be soft or firm. Fluid may be present within the lump. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/chalazion_eyelid_cyst_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chalazion</a> is very common and usually goes away on its own without any special treatment. A chalazion does not cause vision problems unless the lump is so large that it distorts the surface of the eye, but this is rare. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pain</a> is usually not present. A chalazion is also known as a meibomian cyst, tarsal cyst, or conjunctival granuloma.</p>.<p>
A chalazion is caused by clogging of the narrow opening through which a meibomian gland of the eyelid secretes its material. This can be due to narrowing of the opening or hardening of the sebaceous liquid near the opening.
