Cracks in the lips are most commonly associated with chapped lips, medically referred to as cheilitis simplex. 
<i>Cheilitis</i> is the term that denotes inflammation of the lips. Cracking, fissuring, reddening, peeling, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> of the lips can occur when inflammation is present. Inflammation of the lips can be caused by many different conditions; in some cases, the condition can be chronic (persists over time). Wind, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a>, and sun exposure are common environmental causes of cracked lips. Drug reactions, skin diseases, and other conditions can also cause inflammation of the lips.
