Most hiatal hernias are of the so-called "sliding" type, in which the junction of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">esophagus</a> and stomach and part of the stomach protrude into the chest. The junction may reside permanently in the chest, but often it juts into the chest only during a swallow. These hernias can and most often do occur without producing symptoms at all. When they do produce symptoms, they are the typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">GERD</a>).  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn_reflux/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Heartburn</a>, regurgitation, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> are common symptoms. Other symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a> or burning and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swallowing/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">difficulty swallowing</a>. A 
bloated feeling after meal consumption and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shortness of breath</a> sometimes occur.

	There are different causes of hiatal hernias. A decrease in abdominal muscle tone and increased pressure within the abdominal cavity may lead to a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiatal_hernia_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hiatal hernia</a>. Thus, people who are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obese</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnant</a> women are at an increased risk for developing a hiatal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hernia_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hernia</a>. Repetitive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> with excessive straining during bowel movements both increase the intra-abdominal pressure and may contribute to the development of 
	a hiatal hernia. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ascites/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Ascites</a>, an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity, also is associated with the development of a hiatal hernia.
