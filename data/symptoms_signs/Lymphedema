<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lymphedema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lymphedema</a> refers to swelling of any part of the body due to poor functioning of the lymphatic channels that drain away excess fluid. It can occur due to damage to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a> or blockage of the lymphatic channels. In other cases, it is present from birth as part of an inborn abnormality. Symptoms include swelling of the affected body part with skin changes that can include thickening, dimpling, scaling, redness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, and warmth.

Lymphedema praecox is the most common form of primary lymphedema. Meige disease or lymphedema tarda is primary lymphedema that becomes evident after 35 years of age. Secondary lymphedema develops when the lymphatic system is blocked or damaged. In the U.S., surgery for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breast cancer</a>, particularly when combined with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation therapy</a>, is the most common cause. Other causes include any type of surgical procedure that requires removal of regional lymph nodes or lymph vessels. Damage to lymph nodes and channels that can cause lymphedema also include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">burns</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a>, infections, or compression or invasion of lymph nodes by tumors. Worldwide, filariasis (infestation of lymph nodes by the parasite <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i>) is the most common cause of lymphedema.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>
