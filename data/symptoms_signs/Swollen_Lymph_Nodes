<p></p>.<p>Gland swelling commonly refers to enlargement of the lymph glands, also known 
as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a>. Lymph nodes are small rounded or bean-shaped masses of lymphatic 
tissue surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Lymph glands (nodes) are 
located in many places in the lymphatic system throughout the body. Lymph nodes 
filter the lymphatic fluid and store special cells that can trap <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> cells or 
bacteria that are traveling through the body in the lymph fluid. The lymph nodes 
are critical for the body's immune response and are principal sites where many 
immune reactions are initiated.</p>.<p>Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, 
around the collarbone, in the armpit (axilla), and in the groin. Lymph nodes in 
the groin region are referred to as inguinal lymph nodes. During a physical 
examination, a doctor may feel (palpate) these areas to look for 
swollen or 
enlarged lymph glands.</p>.<p>Swelling of the lymph glands is typically a result of 
local or widespread inflammation, but sometimes enlarged lymph nodes are due to

a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph node</a> is referred to as lymphadenitis. </p>.<p>

Sometimes swollen lymph nodes cause no symptoms (referred to as asymptomatic lymph node swelling). Symptoms that can be associated with lymph node swelling, depending on the cause, include</p>.<p>Other glands that are sometimes 
perceptible when swollen are the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adenoids_and_tonsils/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tonsils</a>, parotid glands, salivary glands, tear
