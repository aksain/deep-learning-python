A bladder spasm occurs when the bladder muscle squeezes suddenly without warning, causing an urgent need to release urine. A bladder spasm is referred to medically as a contraction of the detrusor muscle. The spasm can be so severe as to cause the leakage of urine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence_in_women_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">incontinence</a>), which is characteristic of the condition <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/overactive_bladder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urge incontinence</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/overactive_bladder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">overactive bladder</a>.
