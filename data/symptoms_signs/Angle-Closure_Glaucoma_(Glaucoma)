<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Glaucoma</a> is an eye disease characterized by a pattern of progressive damage to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">optic nerve</a> that transmits vision signals to the brain. It is often but not always associated with an increase in pressure within the eye (increased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intraocular pressure</a>). This pressure most often builds up painlessly over time. Signs 
and symptoms typically begin with a subtle loss of side vision (peripheral vision). If not diagnosed and treated, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/glaucoma_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">glaucoma</a> can worsen and cause loss of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">central vision</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blindness</a>. Glaucoma can also occur in an acute form, in which the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intraocular</a> pressure increases very quickly because the drainage angle for the eye fluid becomes closed. An attack of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acute angle-closure glaucoma</a> can cause severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eye pain</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, a red (inflamed) eye, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blurred_vision/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blurred vision</a>.</p>.<p> 
Elevated pressure in the eye is the main factor leading to the damage to the optic nerve. Other causes of glaucoma can include injury or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> to the eye, inflammation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cataracts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cataracts</a>, or decreased blood flow to the optic nerve. A rare, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inherited</a> form of glaucoma can occur in infants at birth.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>
