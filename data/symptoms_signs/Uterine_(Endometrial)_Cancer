The term <i>uterine cancer</i> typically refers to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancers</a> that begin in the lining of the uterus (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endometriosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">endometrium</a>). These are known as endometrial cancers or endometrial carcinomas. Cancers can also form in the muscular wall of the uterus (sarcomas of the uterus), but these are rare. Abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal bleeding</a> is one of the most common symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/uterine_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">uterine cancer</a>. This includes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal bleeding</a> after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>, which is never normal and should always be investigated to find the cause. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Vaginal discharge</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_pain_in_women_and_men/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pelvic pain</a> are other possible symptoms 
and signs. It is also possible to have early stage uterine cancer that does not cause any noticeable signs or symptoms.
