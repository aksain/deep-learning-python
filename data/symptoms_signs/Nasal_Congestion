<p></p>.<p>Nasal congestion, or "stuffy nose," is a term that refers to the obstruction to the flow of air in and out of the nose. In contrast, the term "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/runny_nose/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">runny nose</a>" refers to a discharge (fluid) coming from the nasal passages. Nasal congestion most commonly is the result of inflammation and swelling of the lining tissues of the nasal passages and sinuses. Less commonly, anatomical obstructions (for 
example, a deviated nasal septum, foreign bodies) may lead to nasal congestion. Prolonged use of certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nasal_allergy_relief_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nasal decongestant</a> sprays or drops can lead to a worsening of nasal congestion. Rarely, tumors of the nasal passages or chronic medical conditions may be the cause of nasal congestion.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
