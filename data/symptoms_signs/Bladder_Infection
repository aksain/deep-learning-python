<p></p>.<p>Symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bladder infection</a> are similar to those of any lower urinary 
tract infection (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">UTI</a>). These symptoms are similar in men, women, and children. 
The main symptoms of bladder infection are</p>.<p>
There may be a sense of needing to
urinate frequently 
(urinary frequency) or having to urinate urgently (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_urgency/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary urgency</a>). Passing 
only a small amount of urine even though you feel the need to urinate is another 
common symptoms. A cloudy appearance to the urine can be present if there is a 
bacterial infection that produces pus in the urine. The urine also may be red in 
color due to bleeding. Alternatively, the urine may not be changed in 
appearance, but <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a>, bacteria, or white blood cells may be detected 
on microscopic examination of the urine. </p>.<p>Men and women may feel 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain in the lower abdomen</a>. Men may also feel 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rectal_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain in 
the rectum</a>, while women may feel <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> around the area of the pubic bone. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fever</a> 
is not a common symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bladder infection</a>; <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> is more typical of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary 
tract infections</a> that have spread to the kidneys or bloodstream. </p>.<p>It is possible to have a bladder infection without having the characteristic 
symptoms. Infants may not have specific symptoms and may appear lethargic and 
fussy. Also in the elderly, specific signs and symptoms may not be present. In 
some cases, bladder infections may not cause symptoms at all.</p>.<p>
Bladder infection is typically caused by a bacterial infection. The bacterial 
type known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');"><i>E. coli</i> (<i>Escherichia coli</i>)</a> is the most common organism responsible for bladder infection or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bladder_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cystitis</a>.  Other types of bacteria that can cause bladder infection and other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infections</a> include 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">staph</a> organisms (from skin) and other gut bacteria (<i>Proteus</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, and
<i>Enterococcus</i>).
