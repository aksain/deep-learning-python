Sometimes, an area of irritation or discoloration on the lining issues of the throat is the only sign of an abnormality. Depending upon the extent of spread of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, other symptoms can include swelling of nearby tissues,

The exact cause of throat cancer is not clear. However, certain risk factors lead to an increased risk of throat cancer, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cigarette smoking</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">human papillomavirus</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a>) infection, and exposure to toxic substances like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asbestos-related_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">asbestos</a> or large quantities of alcohol. About 50%-90% of squamous cell carcinomas (the most common type of throat cancers), have been associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a> infections that can be acquired with oral sex. Other risk factors include male gender, African-American heritage, and poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dental_oral_health_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dental hygiene</a>.
