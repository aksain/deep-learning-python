and is characterized by the consistent inability to sustain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse or the inability to achieve
ejaculation, or both. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/erectile_dysfunction_ed_impotence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Erectile dysfunction</a> can vary. It can involve a total inability to achieve an erection or ejaculation, an inconsistent ability to do so, or a tendency to sustain only very brief erections.</p>.<p>
The risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_pictures_slideshow_erectile_dysfunction/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impotence</a> increases with age. It is much more frequent in men in their 60s compared with those in their 40s. Men with less education are also more likely to experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/impotence_erectile_dysfunction_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">impotence</a>, perhaps because they tend to have less healthy lifestyles, eat a less healthy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, drink more, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> less.</p>.<p>
