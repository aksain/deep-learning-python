<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pericoronitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pericoronitis</a> is an inflammation of the gum issue that surrounds the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_dentistry_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">crown</a> portion of a tooth that is partially not erupted. It is usually seen around the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) where gum tissue overlaps the chewing surface of the tooth.  In chronic pericoronitis, there is a persistent and long-standing inflammation of the gum tissue. In acute pericoronitis, an infection is present that leads to swelling, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, and possibly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>. Pericoronitis is not the same as gum inflammation (or periodontitis) in that it occurs specifically around a partially erupted tooth that has not completely emerged.

The primary cause for pericoronitis is trapping of bacteria and food debris in the space between the tooth and the overlapping gum. This overlapping gum is called an operculum.
