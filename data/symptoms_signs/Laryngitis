<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/laryngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Laryngitis</a> is inflammation of the voice box, or larynx, resulting in voice changes such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hoarseness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hoarseness</a> or loss of the voice completely in some cases. It is most commonly due to an infection such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">common cold</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">flu</a> and typically follows a period of experiencing a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cough</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>. However, laryngitis can also develop in response to chronic irritation of the larynx. For example, some conditions like gastroesophageal reflux (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">GERD</a>), some cancers, chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adenoids_and_tonsils/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tonsillitis</a>, and other conditions can lead to inflammation.  Voice overuse and irritants like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cigarette smoke</a> can also lead to irritation of the voice box and laryngitis.</p>.<p>
