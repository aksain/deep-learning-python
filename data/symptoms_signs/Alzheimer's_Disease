<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a> is a common cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dementia</a> and its associated symptoms. Memory problems that develop slowly over time are often the main or first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Later symptoms can include personality changes like apathy, withdrawal, and reduced spontaneity. Trouble with abstract thinking and significant cognitive loss can develop with time. Other symptoms of the mental decline seen in people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a> can include</p>.<p>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Mood changes</a>, wandering, erratic behavior, uncooperativeness, and anger can be seen in the later stages of the disease. Physical symptoms can include loss of bowel control or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary incontinence</a>.

The cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's disease</a> is unknown. One theory has emerged from the study of early onset <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inherited</a> (genetic) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's</a> disease. Certain genetic mutations associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alzheimer's</a> disease have been found in about half of the patients with early onset disease. These mutations result in excess production in the brain of a specific form of a small protein fragment called ABeta (AÎ²) that accumulates in the brain. This has been called the "amyloid cascade hypothesis."
