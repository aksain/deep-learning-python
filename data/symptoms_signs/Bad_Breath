<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bad_breath/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Bad breath</a>, medically known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bad_breath/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">halitosis</a>, is a common problem. Bad breath is usually simple and preventable. Dietary factors as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tobacco</a> and alcohol use may all be factors in causing bad breath. Poor oral hygiene, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gum_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gum disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tooth decay</a>, or mouth infections can also be causes of halitosis. Infections in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>, sinuses, or airways can also cause bad breath due to the presence of nasal secretions that may drain into the mouth. Chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/postnasal_drip_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">postnasal drip</a>, for example as occurs with sinus infections, can be a cause of bad breath. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Coughing</a> up sputum from lung infections can also cause bad breath. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dry mouth</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_mouth/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">xerostomia</a>) can be a side effect of certain medications, increasing the tendency to develop bad breath. Certain chronic diseases that severely restrict <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> or kidney function may also alter the odor of the breath. Other chronic conditions that can be associated with bad breath include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acid reflux</a> disease.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
