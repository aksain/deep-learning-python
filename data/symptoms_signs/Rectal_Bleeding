(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anal_fissure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anal fissures</a>) from straining against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hard stools</a> with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> to serious conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>. Blood in the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stool</a> should be evaluated by a health care professional. </p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_the_stool_rectal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Rectal bleeding</a> (known 
medically as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_in_the_stool_rectal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hematochezia</a>) refers to passage of bright red blood from the anus, 
often mixed with stool and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">blood clots</a>. Most rectal bleeding comes from the 
colon, rectum, or anus and can be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a>. The color of the blood during rectal bleeding often depends 
on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, 
the closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the blood will be a brighter 
red. Thus, bleeding from the anus, rectum, and the sigmoid colon tend to 
be bright red, whereas bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon (transverse 
and right colon are several feet away from the anus) tend to 
be dark red or maroon colored.</p>.<p>In some patients, bleeding can be black and "tarry" (sticky) and foul 
smelling. The black, smelly, and tarry stool is called 
melena. Melena occurs when 
the blood is in the colon long enough for the bacteria in the colon to break it 
down into chemicals (hematin) that are black. Therefore, melena usually 
signifies bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract (for example, 
bleeding from ulcers in the stomach or the duodenum or from the small intestine) 
because the blood usually is in the gastrointestinal tract for a longer period 
of time before it exits the body. Sometimes melena may occur with bleeding from 
the right colon. On the other hand, blood from the sigmoid colon and the rectum 
usually does not stay in the colon long enough for the bacteria to turn it 
black. Rarely, massive bleeding from the right colon, from the small intestine, 
or from ulcers of the stomach or duodenum can cause rapid transit of the blood 
through the gastrointestinal tract and result in bright red rectal bleeding. In 
these situations, the blood is moving through the colon so rapidly that there is 
not enough time for the bacteria to turn the blood black.</p>.<p>Sometimes, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can be 
too slow to cause either rectal bleeding or melena. In these patients, bleeding 
is occult (not visible to the naked eye). The blood is found only by testing 
the stool for blood (fecal occult blood testing) in the laboratory. Occult 
bleeding has many of the same causes as rectal bleeding and may result in the 
same symptoms as rectal bleeding. It is often associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> that is due to loss of 
iron along with the blood (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">iron deficiency anemia</a>).</p>.<p>Causes of rectal bleeding include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemorrhoids_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemorrhoids</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anal_fissure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anal fissure</a>,
