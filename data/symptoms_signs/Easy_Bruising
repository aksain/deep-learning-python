A bruise is a traumatic injury of the soft tissues that results in breakage of the local capillaries and leakage of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a>. In the skin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bruising</a> can be seen as a reddish-purple discoloration that does not blanch when pressed upon. This discoloration leads to the classic "black and blue" appearance. When a bruise fades, it becomes green and brown as the body metabolizes the blood cells and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bilirubin_and_bilirubin_blood_test/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bilirubin</a> pigment in the skin. A bruise can sometimes be associated with a temporary raised area in the skin and is usually associated with some tenderness. A bruise is best treated with local application of a cold pack immediately after injury.</p>.<p> 
A bruise is medically termed a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contusion</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Bruises</a> are typically a result of some degree of injury to the blood vessels in the skin. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Easy bruising</a> may be a result of a seemingly insignificant compression of skin or there may be no skin injury recollected. Easy bruising can occur when the blood vessels are weakened by diseases (such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/scurvy_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scurvy</a>), medications (such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisone</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prednisolone/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prednisolone</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a>. Easy bruising can also occur because of absent or deficient blood-clotting elements. Local leakage of blood into the skin from the capillaries that occurs spontaneously, without injury, 
and results in a flat, purplish discolored area is referred to as 
ecchymosis. Ecchymosis is usually not associated with tenderness.
