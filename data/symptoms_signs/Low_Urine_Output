Low urine output, or no urine output, occurs in the setting of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney failure</a> as well as in urinary obstruction. As the kidneys fail or become compromised in their ability to function, the kidneys lose the ability to regulate fluids and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">electrolytes</a> and to remove waste products from the body. Additionally, red blood cell production (which is normally driven by a substance produced in the kidneys) decreases. Low urine output also occurs when there is a decreased blood supply to the kidney, such as occurs with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dehydration</a> or excessive blood loss. Obstruction of outflow of the urine, either due to tumors, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/benign_prostatic_hyperplasia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">enlargement of the prostate</a>, or bladder problems can also reduce urine output. Reduced urine output as a result of kidney failure can 
be acute, as with toxins or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sepsis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sepsis</a>, or chronic. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Chronic renal failure</a> develops over time and can result from poorly controlled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>.
