<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peptic_ulcer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Peptic ulcer</a> disease is characterized by sores, or ulcerations, in the lining tissues of the stomach or the duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine. Peptic ulcers can be caused by a number of conditions, including certain medications, excessive alcohol use, and other medical conditions.

The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> can be sharp or dull and is often described as burning. Some affected people have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">indigestion</a> that may quickly resolve after taking antacids or eating foods that neutralize stomach acids. Other people with peptic ulcers may not have symptoms at all or may have only very mild symptoms. The severity of the ulcers is not related to the severity of the symptoms they cause; mild ulcers may cause severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, while severe ulcers may only cause mild symptoms.</p>.<p>
