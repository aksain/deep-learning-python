Poor hygiene can be a sign of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/self-neglect/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">self-neglect</a>, which is the inability or unwillingness to attend to one's personal needs. Poor hygiene often accompanies certain mental or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">emotional disorders</a>, 
including severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psychotic_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">psychotic disorders</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dementia</a> is another common 
cause of poor hygiene. Other people may develop poor hygiene habits due to 
social factors such as poverty or inadequacy of social support. Physical 
disabilities can also interfere with one's ability to care for oneself and may 
result in an individual being unable to attend to personal hygiene. There is no treatment for poor hygiene, although antipsychotic and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">antidepressant</a> medications are used when certain mental illnesses are the cause of this behavior.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
