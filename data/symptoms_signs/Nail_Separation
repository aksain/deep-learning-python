Separation of the nail from the nail bed, medically known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/onycholysis_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">onycholysis</a>, is a common condition that results in a white appearance of the affected part of the nail. 
Fingernail or toenail separation can have numerous causes but is typically related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> or a

Nail separation can sometimes be associated with other abnormalities of the nails, including

Toenail or fingernail separation is generally painless and may occur gradually, without the affected individual being aware of a distinct cause.
