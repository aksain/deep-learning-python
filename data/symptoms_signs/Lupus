Nevertheless, there are certain symptoms 
and signs commonly associated with the condition.</p>.<p>
The signs and symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lupus</a> are sometimes described in terms of the classic triad of</p>.<p> However, symptoms can affect many different parts of the body and are not the same in all patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/systemic_lupus_erythematosus_1_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lupus</a>. Symptoms also vary widely in severity among affected people. </p>.<p>
General symptoms associated with lupus include</p>.<p>
 Weight changes can also occur. More specific symptoms include skin changes (see below), 
	ulcers of the mouth and nose, 
photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), and decreased circulation to the fingers and toes with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a> exposure. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/raynauds_phenomenon/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Raynaud's phenomenon</a> is a manifestation of this change in circulation.</p>.<p>
The most typical skin symptom of lupus is the development of the so-called "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lupus_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">butterfly rash</a>" over the nose and cheeks. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a> is painless and does not itch. It may worsen with sun exposure, like other inflammatory processes associated with the disease. People with discoid lupus have involvement of only the skin. Those with this condition often have a rash over the face and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a> that can lead, with time, to 
scarring and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hair loss</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alopecia</a>).</p>.<p>
People with lupus can have a decrease in platelets and white blood cells, increasing the risks for bleeding and infection. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Anemia</a> may also be present. Widespread inflammation in different areas of the body can have serious consequences, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vasculitis</a> (inflammation of blood vessels, which can impair circulation and oxygen delivery), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pleurisy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pleuritis</a> (inflammation of the lining of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lungs</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pericarditis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pericarditis</a> (inflammation of the lining sac of the heart). Pleuritis and pericarditis can result in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a>. Other manifestations of lupus in the lung can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pleural_effusion_fluid_in_the_chest_or_on_lung/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pleural effusion</a> (fluid collection in the space surrounding the lungs) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interstitial_lung_disease_interstitial_pneumonia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">interstitial lung disease</a>. In the heart, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/myocarditis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">myocarditis</a> (inflammation of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart muscle</a>) can occur.</p>.<p>
Inflammation in the kidneys due to lupus (lupus nephritis) can cause leakage of protein into the urine (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/proteinuria_protein_in_the_urine/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">proteinuria</a>), fluid retention, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>, and even 
acute or chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney failure</a>. This can lead to worsening of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> and swelling of the legs and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a>.</p>.<p>
Involvement of the brain can cause personality changes, thought disorders (psychosis), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a>, and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coma</a>. Lupus-related nerve damage can cause numbness, tingling, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a> of the involved body parts or extremities.
