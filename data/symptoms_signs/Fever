<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fever</a> is considered a temperature above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees 
C). A feverish sensation, however, may occur when the body 
temperature is above the average normal of 98.6 degrees F. (37 degrees C).  </p>.<p> 
Fever is part of the body's own disease-fighting arsenal. Rising body 
temperatures apparently are capable of killing off many disease-producing organisms. For that reason, low fevers should normally go 
untreated.  Although, if the 
fever is accompanied by any other troubling symptoms, you may need to see your doctor to be certain. As fevers range 
to 104 F and above, however, there can be unwanted 
consequences, particularly for children. These can include

and convulsions. A fever of this sort demands immediate home 
treatment and then medical attention. Home treatment possibilities 
include the use of aspirin or, in children, nonaspirin painkillers 
such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), cool baths, or sponging to reduce the fever 
while seeking medical help. Fever may occur with almost any type of 
infection of illness. The temperature is measured with a thermometer.
