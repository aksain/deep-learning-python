The symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (known as "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mono</a>") are nonspecific at the beginning. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lack of energy</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> are common initial complaints. These can be accompanied by a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loss of appetite</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chills</a>. These early symptoms may last for a few days before more severe symptoms begin.</p>.<p>
The characteristic symptoms of mono include a painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fever</a> can occur and may persist for several days. It is common to experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swollen lymph nodes</a> in the neck. Along with the painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>, the throat may be reddened, and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adenoids_and_tonsils/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tonsils</a> may appear swollen with a whitish coating on the surface. Often, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a> is what prompts affected people to seek medical care.</p>.<p>
Enlargement of the spleen occurs in up to half of people with mono. Enlargement of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> can also occur, along with inflammation that raises blood levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_blood_tests/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver enzymes</a>. Less commonly, a red <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a> may appear all over the body. Some people notice a swelling of the upper eyelids early in the course of the illness.

The infection can be spread by saliva, so the condition is sometimes referred to as the "kissing disease." Using contaminated items, such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes, can also spread the infection.
