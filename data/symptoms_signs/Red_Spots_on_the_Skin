Red spots on the skin are a common medical complaint. When the spots occur in outbreaks, they are sometimes termed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rashes</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Rashes</a> can occur due to infections of the skin, disseminated infections (that have spread throughout the body), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> reactions, or irritations of the skin. When a red bump or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a> is flat, it is medically known as a macule. When the red spot is raised, it is known as a papule. Erythema is the medical term for redness of the skin.</p>.<p>
Red spots on the skin that occur singly can be a small benign <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a> of blood vessels, known as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hemangioma_1_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemangioma</a>. Tiny, pinpoint hemorrhages can be seen in the skin and are referred to as petechiae. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Bleeding disorders</a> can also lead to the formation of purplish red spots that are larger, known as purpura.</p>.<p> 
Rashes can be associated with other symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hives/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hives</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a>. Red spots on the skin that are related to underlying medical conditions will be associated with symptoms of the underlying condition.
