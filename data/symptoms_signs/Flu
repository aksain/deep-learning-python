<i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> is a bacterium that was incorrectly considered to cause the flu until 
a virus was demonstrated to be the correct cause in 1933. This bacterium can cause lung infections in infants and children and can sometimes cause sinus or other infections. Other bacterial or viral infections, including the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">common cold</a>, 
may cause symptoms similar to the flu.

Influenza <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> cause the flu (influenza). Influenza viruses are divided into three types, designated influenza types A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates of hospitalization and death. Influenza type C usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all.
