<p></p>.<p>A certain amount of vaginal discharge (fluid that flows out the vaginal 
opening) other than the expected <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal bleeding</a> at <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstruation</a> is normal. The 
vaginal walls and uterine cervix contain glands that produce a small amount of 
fluid that helps to keep the vagina clean. This normal fluid is usually thin and 
clear or milky white and does not have an unpleasant smell. Vaginal discharge is 
thicker at specific times of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual cycle</a> (at the time of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ovulation</a>),

vaginal discharge is normal and is not associated with the symptoms and signs of
