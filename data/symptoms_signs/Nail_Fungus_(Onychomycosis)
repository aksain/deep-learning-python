Fungal infection of the nails may cause changes in the nail itself and its appearance, including 
symptoms and signs such as</p>.<p>
Fungal nails may appear brittle, broken, and lifted or separated from the nail bed. Changes in the nail appearance are typically the first signs and symptoms of fungal nails. The condition may also cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> and disfigurement in some cases, although this is not common. In severe cases, fungal nails can cause problems with standing, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">walking</a>, and

A number of conditions can increase the risk that fungi infect the nails. Fungus that is caught from moist, wet areas are common causes in healthy people. Communal showers, such as those at a gym or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swimming/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swimming</a> pools, are common sources. Visiting nail salons that use inadequate sanitization of instruments (such as clippers, filers, and foot tubs) is another way that the infection may be spread. Living with family members who have fungal nails is another risk factor. Wearing tight-fitting, sweaty shoes associated with repetitive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> to the toenails occurs in many athletes and increases the susceptibility to fungal nails. People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/athletes_foot/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">athlete's foot</a> are more likely to have fungal nails, since the causative fungus may infect the toenails. The elderly and people with suppressed immune function are also at risk.</p>.<p>
<i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> is the most common type of fungus to infect the nails. This fungus is a dermatophyte, meaning that it is a fungus that infects skin and nails.
