<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Type 2 diabetes</a> is usually caused by insufficient production of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insulin</a>, production of defective insulin (which is uncommon), or the inability of the body's cells to use insulin properly (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_resistance/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insulin resistance</a>). Both genetics (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inherited</a> factors) and lifestyle factors (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">overweight</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obesity</a>) affect a person's chances of developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 2 diabetes</a>. The absolute lack of insulin, usually related to damage to or destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas likely due to an autoimmune reaction, is the cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 1 diabetes</a>. There is also an inherited (genetic) risk for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">type 1 diabetes</a>.
