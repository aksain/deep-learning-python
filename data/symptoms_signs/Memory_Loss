<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Memory loss</a>, also referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amnesia</a>, is an abnormal 
degree of forgetfulness and/or inability to recall past events. Depending on the 
cause, memory loss may have either a sudden or gradual onset, and memory loss may be 
permanent or temporary. Memory loss may be limited to the inability to recall 
recent events, events from the distant past, or a combination of both. Although 
the normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> process can 
result in difficulty in learning and retaining new material, normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/healthy_seniors_pictures_slideshow_exercise_aging/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> itself 
is not a cause of significant memory loss unless there is accompanying disease 
 that is responsible for the memory loss. </p>.<p>Transient global amnesia is a rare, temporary, complete loss of all memory. 
 Anterograde amnesia refers to the inability to remember recent events in the 
aftermath of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>, but recollection of events in the distant past in 
unaltered. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events preceding a 
trauma, but recall of events afterward is possible. </p>.<p>Memory loss has multiple causes including a number of 
chronic medical and 
psychological conditions, trauma, medications, 
drug or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">alcohol abuse</a>, and 
infections.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
