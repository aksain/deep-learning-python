Most miscarriages are believed to be caused by genetic problems such as chromosomal abnormalities within the embryo that prevent normal development and survival. These genetic problems are not usually related to genetic problems in the mother. In other cases, the cause of miscarriage is unknown.  Certain diseases or medical conditions can also cause miscarriage or may increase the risk. These include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">thyroid disease</a>, and infections that can spread to the placenta.
