<p></p>.<p>The symptoms of meningitis arise due to inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Meningitis</a> can occur due to infections or due to diseases that cause systemic inflammation in the body. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Headache</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> are common symptoms. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stiff_neck/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Stiff neck</a> is also a characteristic symptom in adults and older children.  These symptoms may come on suddenly and may be severe.</p>.<p>
Other symptoms that involve the nervous system can also be present with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/meningitis_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">meningitis</a>. These include 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">seizures</a>, lethargy, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a>, sleepiness, or trouble waking up. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> can also accompany the symptoms of meningitis. Some patients report sensitivity to light. With some types of meningitis (due to 
<i>N. meningitides</i> infection), a skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a> may develop.</p>.<p>
In infants, the symptoms of meningitis are often much less specific than in older children and adults. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Fever</a>, irritability, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tiredness</a>, and fussiness can all be related to meningitis in an infant.

Meningitis can be caused by infections of any type. Most commonly, viral infections are the cause of meningitis. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Bacterial infections</a> are another common cause, while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fungal_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fungal infections</a> are a less common cause of meningitis. Other conditions that cause inflammation of the meninges include chemical irritation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> reactions to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>, and spread of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> to the meninges.
