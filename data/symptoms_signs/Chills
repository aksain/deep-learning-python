<p></p>.<p>Chills are feelings of coldness accompanied by shivering. They may arise with or without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>. Without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, chills typically arise after exposure to a cold environment. Essentially any condition that may produce fever (including infections and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancers</a>) can result in chills along with fever.

Exposure to a cold environment can result in chills. With prolonged or constant exposure to cold, serious injuries related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothermia_extended_exposure_to_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypothermia</a> (a lowered core body temperature) can result. Chills in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a> are due to the same causes (hypothermia, infection) as chills in general.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
