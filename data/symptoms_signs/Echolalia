Echolalia is the unsolicited and meaningless repetition (echoing) of another person's vocalizations, or speech. The person with echolalia may repeat noises, phrases, or words.  Echolalia is a symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_damage_symptoms_causes_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain damage</a> or psychiatric disorders, and the person with echolalia may or may not be able to communicate normally or understand others. Children with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> and developmental disorders, as well as very young children, may exhibit echolalia. It is not the same as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tourette_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tourette syndrome</a>, in which people may make involuntary verbal exclamations, although in some cases, echolalia may be present in people with Tourette syndrome.
