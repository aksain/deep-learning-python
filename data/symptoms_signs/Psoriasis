The hallmark symptoms of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, are plaques composed of thick, scaly skin. These are typically reddened in appearance with silvery scales that have sometimes been said to resemble ashes.  The elbows, knees, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a> are common sites of involvement, although other areas of skin can be affected, as well. The condition can start as a few red

The nails may be affected, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">psoriasis</a> of the nails causes ridged, thick, or pitted nails and can ultimately lead to separation of the nails from the nail bed. Symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arthritis</a>, including 
stiffness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, and

The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown. Both genetic predisposition and environmental factors are thought to be involved in its development, and defects in immune system regulation are thought to play a major role. Psoriasis is commonly found in members of the same family. </p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCES:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
