<p></p>.<p>The symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_tumor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain tumor</a> vary according to the size, type, and location of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tumor</a>. Symptoms typically arise because of destruction or damage to the brain, swelling of the brain, or blockage of the flow of fluid that flows around the brain and spinal cord.</p>.<p>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_tumor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Brain tumors</a> may be benign or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">malignant</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">brain cancer</a>). It is important to note that most cases of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> within the brain are metastatic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancers</a> from other sites in the body. However, true brain cancers (malignant brain tumors) do exist. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause the symptoms described in this article.</p>.<p>
Some of the most common symptoms of brain tumors include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>, which can be severe and are typically worse in the mornings. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> may not respond to usual treatments for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a> and may be of a different type or pattern than previous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headaches</a>. Changes in vision, speech, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hearing</a> can occur. 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Seizures</a> or convulsions can be symptoms of a brain tumor. Other possible symptoms include 
gait disturbances, 
balance problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, 
memory problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a> in one part of the body, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/difficulty_concentrating/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">difficulty concentrating</a>, personality changes, and numbness or tingling in the extremities.</p>.<p>
It's important to note that all of these symptoms can be due to other conditions and most commonly arise from causes other than a brain tumor.

The exact cause of brain tumors is not well understood. Risk factors can include exposure to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> and family history of brain tumors.
