<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sweating</a> is the act of secreting fluid from the skin by the sweat (sudoriferous) glands. These are small tubular glands situated within and under the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue). They discharge by tiny openings in the surface of the skin. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sweating_perspiration_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sweating</a> is a normal response that helps regulate body temperature. People sweat more when it's hot outside or when they <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a>. Increased sweating can also occur due to emotional states such as anger, fear, nervousness, or embarrassment.</p>.<p>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Excessive sweating</a> is referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperhidrosis</a>, and some people may have a tendency to excessive sweating, known as primary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperhidrosis</a>. Sweating can also be a symptom of several medical conditions, especially when the sweating is excessive or inappropriate. Many types of infections and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancers</a> are associated with increased sweating that particularly occurs at night. Sweating may accompany <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hot_flashes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hot flashes</a> during the menopausal transition. Damage to the autonomic nerves for any reason, for example, as a result of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, can cause excessive sweating.</p>.<p>
