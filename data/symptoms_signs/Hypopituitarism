The symptoms of hypopituitarism result from decreased hormone production by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pituitary_gland_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pituitary gland</a>. When all the pituitary hormones are affected, the condition is known as panhypopituitarism. Isolated or partial hypopituitarism results when the production of one or more hormones is decreased. The symptoms are variable and depend on the severity of the condition and the number of hormones that are affected. Symptoms can include</p>.<p>
Women may experience irregular menstrual cycles, loss of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstruation</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amenorrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amenorrhea</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">infertility</a>, and the inability to produce milk. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Infertility</a> can affect males, as well as a reduction in hair on the face or body. Hypopituitarism in children can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/achondroplasia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">short stature</a> and delayed growth and development. Other symptoms and signs include</p>.<p>
Hypopituitarism has many causes. Any condition that damages the pituitary gland or the area of the brain known as the hypothalamus (which regulates the pituitary gland's function) can cause the pituitary to decrease hormone production. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prolactinoma/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pituitary tumor</a> is sometimes the cause of hypopituitarism. Other causes can include surgery or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> to the brain, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> treatment, infections of the brain, loss of blood during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_pain_relief_options_for_birth/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">childbirth</a> (Sheehan syndrome), genetic conditions that result in impaired pituitary hormone production, autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary gland, and so-called infiltrative diseases, in which abnormal cells of the immune response or abnormal substances accumulate in the gland. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sarcoidosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sarcoidosis</a> is an example of an infiltrative disease that can cause hypopituitarism.
