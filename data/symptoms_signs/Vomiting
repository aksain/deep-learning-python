<i>Emesis</i> is the medical term for vomiting. Vomiting is the forcible emptying of the stomach in which the stomach has to overcome the pressures that are normally in place to keep food and secretions within the stomach. Causes of vomiting are varied and include 
food-borne illnesses (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">food poisoning</a>), infections, problems with the brain and central nervous system, and systemic (body-wide) diseases. Some illnesses will cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and vomiting, even though there is no direct involvement of the stomach or gastrointestinal tract.
