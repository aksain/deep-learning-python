<p></p>.<p>Even though the symptoms produced by a vaginal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yeast_infection_in_women_and_men/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">yeast infection</a> (also referred 
to as vaginal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/candidiasis_moniliasis_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">candidiasis</a> or yeast <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginitis_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginitis</a>) are similar among affected women, they are not at all specific. In fact, studies have shown that many women attempt to treat what they believe are the early symptoms and signs of a vaginal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yeast_infection_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">yeast infection</a>  using over-the-counter medications when they actually have a different condition. So, if you are unsure about whether or not you have a yeast infection, or if you have never had one before, it's important to see 
a doctor to be sure that you are treating the correct conditions before starting any treatment.</p>.<p>
Signs and symptoms of a yeast infection are similar to those of other causes of vaginitis (inflammation or irritation of the vaginal canal), including 
<i>Trichomonas</i> infection and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_vaginosis_causes_symptoms_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bacterial vaginosis</a>:</p>.<p>
The most common organism that causes yeast infections is known as <i>Candida albicans</i>. This type of yeast can be present in normal, healthy women in the vaginal canal. Most commonly, it is present without causing any symptoms 
or signs at all. It is only when an overgrowth of this organism is present that symptoms 
and signs of a yeast infection may manifest. This happens when the balance of protective bacteria in the vagina is disturbed, either due to illness, hormonal changes, or taking certain medications, particularly antibiotics or immune-suppressing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>. Conditions that affect the function of the immune system, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a>, can increase a woman's risk of getting a yeast infection. Sometimes, no cause for the overgrowth of yeast is discovered.
