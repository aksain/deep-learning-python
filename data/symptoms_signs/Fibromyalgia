The main symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fibromyalgia</a> is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> that is believed to derive from an increased sensitivity to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> stimuli. The pain can be brought on by different situations, including noises, weather changes, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, but it may also occur without any relation to external events. The characteristic pain usually affects the neck, buttocks, shoulders, arms, upper back, and chest. "Tender points" are localized areas of the body that are tender to light touch. The tender points of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fibromyalgia</a> are commonly located around the elbows, shoulders, knees, hips, back of the head, and the sides of the breastbone.</p>.<p>

Genetics has been shown to play a role in the causation of fibromyalgia. While <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> does not cause the condition, the symptoms often become evident after stressful events. These events may be emotional (such as a traumatic life event), physical (such as car accidents), or medical (for example, certain infections, illnesses, or conditions that cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chronic pain</a>). The symptoms are thought to arise from an abnormality in the manner in which the brain and spinal cord process pain sensations. This results in a lower threshold at which stimuli cause pain or discomfort in people with fibromyalgia. Further, pain can be more intense because of abnormalities in the central nervous system and in pain processing.
