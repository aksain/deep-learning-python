<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scratch_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cat scratch disease</a> is also known as catscratch disease, cat scratch fever, or subacute regional lymphadenitis. Most patients have a history of exposure to cats, and the disease begins with a reddish brown nodule (small bump) on the skin at the site of infection. There is typically no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or tenderness. Over the next weeks, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_lymph_nodes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swollen lymph nodes</a> develop that may be accompanied by tenderness.

Cat scratch disease occurs due to bacterial infection of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a> with bacteria known as 
<i>Bartonella henselae</i>. It is often caused by a bite or scratch from a cat that carries the bacteria. Cats who carry 
<i>B. henselae</i> do not show any signs of illness.
