The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zika_virus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Zika virus</a> is transmitted to humans by the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bug_bites_and_stings/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bite of a mosquito</a> that carries the virus. When it causes symptoms (in about 
one out of every five infections), it typically produces a disease that lasts a few days to a week. Common Zika fever symptoms 
and signs include</p>.<p>
 Most people who get the infection have an excellent prognosis and recover completely without complications. However, in Brazil, the viral infection has been linked to a birth defect known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/microcephaly/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">microcephaly</a> (small head and small brain size) in newborns whose mothers became infected with Zika virus during their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>.</p>.<p>
Zika virus is a flavivirus that is related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dengue_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dengue fever</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/west_nile_encephalitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">West Nile</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yellow_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">yellow fever</a>, and Japanese encephalitis <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> (<i>Flaviviridae</i>). These viruses are transmitted to humans by mosquito bites, and this is the primary method of spread. Blood product transfusions and organ transplantation may allow rare person-to-person transmission. Other possible methods of spread may be mother to fetus and under certain conditions, by sexual contact. About 
one in five people who become infected develop symptoms and signs.
