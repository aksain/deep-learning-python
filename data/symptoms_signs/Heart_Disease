The term <em><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a></em> is very broad and includes a number of conditions, ranging from congenital (inborn) abnormalities of the heart to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery disease</a> caused by atherosclerosis. Sometimes the term is used synonymously with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coronary artery disease</a>, but in the true sense of the term, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a> can apply to any number of conditions.</p>.<p>
Accordingly, the symptoms of heart disease will depend upon the type of disease that is present. When disease such as atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries prevents the heart muscle from receiving enough oxygen, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shortness of breath</a> may result. Less commonly, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> of coronary artery disease can manifest as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">back pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neck_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">neck pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arm_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arm pain</a>, or upper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Heart failure</a> can cause different symptoms, including some nonspecific symptoms such as swelling and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>. 
Arrhythmias are another type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart disease</a>. Symptoms of arrhythmias can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>, racing heart, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/palpitations_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">palpitations</a>. The list of possible symptoms that can occur with heart conditions is very broad and reflects disturbances in heart function and circulation as well as loss of oxygen delivery to critical organs.</p>.<p>
Heart disease encompasses a number of different conditions, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congenital_heart_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">congenital heart defects</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth defects</a>), coronary artery disease or atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, abnormal heartbeats known as arrhythmias, or diseases of the heart muscle. A number of environmental and genetic factors are related to the development of heart disease, and the exact cause depends upon the exact type of heart disease.
