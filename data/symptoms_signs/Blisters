They look like bubbles on the surface of the skin. Although they are often caused by irritation or friction (such as with a poorly fitting shoe), blisters can also represent disease processes. Blisters can accompany some types of skin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rashes</a> and inflammatory conditions, including certain autoimmune diseases. Depending upon the cause of the blisters, blisters may occur singly or in groups. In contrast to abscesses and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/boils/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">boils</a>, which are collections of inflammatory fluid found deep in the tissues, blisters are found in the most superficial layer of skin.</p>.<p>
Small fluid-filled blisters are medically known as vesicles. Bullae (singular = bulla) are blisters that are larger than 1 cm across.
