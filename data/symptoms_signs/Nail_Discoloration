<p></p>.<p>Nail discoloration, in which the nails appear white, 
yellow, or green, can result from different infections and conditions of the 
skin. In about 50% of 
cases, discolored nails are a result of infections with common fungi that can be 
found in the air, dust, and soil. There are many species of fungi that can 
affect nails. By far the most common, however, is called <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i>. 
This type of fungus has a tendency 
to infect the skin and is therefore known as a dermatophyte. <i>
Pseudomonas</i> is a 
type of bacteria that infects the nail bed and 
results in a greenish color to the nails. Red or black (that may sometimes appear 
bruised) nails may result from a

of the nails. Specific color changes in the nails can be suggestive of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> 
 or of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a>, 
 kidney, heart, or lung 
conditions. This is why doctors pay specific attention to 
nails during a routine physical examination. </p>.<p>Other, rare causes of discolored nails include the 
"yellow nail syndrome," an inherited condition that results in slow-growing, 
yellowing, discolored nails and is 
associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lymphedema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymphedema</a> (swelling of 
tissues due to the accumulation of fluid) and lung diseases. Nails may also

nail from the nail bed, termed
