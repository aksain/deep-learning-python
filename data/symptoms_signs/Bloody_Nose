<p></p>.<p>The nose is a part 
of the body that is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) 
and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a 
result, any <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> to the face can cause a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nosebleed/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bloody nose</a>, and bleeding may 
be profuse.  Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the 
nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as is common in 
dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is 
dry and warm from household heaters. People are more 
susceptible if they are taking medications that prevent 
normal blood clotting (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Coumadin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">warfarin</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aspirin</a>, or any 
anti-inflammatory medication). Other predisposing factors 
include infection, trauma, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic</a> and non-allergic

bleeding problems.</p>.<p>To stop a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nosebleed/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nosebleed</a>, you should: 1. 
Pinch all the soft  parts of the nose together between your 
thumb and index finger. 2. Press firmly toward the face - 
compressing the pinched parts of the nose against the bones 
of the face. 3. Hold the nose for at least 5 minutes (timed 
by the clock). Repeat as necessary until the nose has 
stopped bleeding. 4. Sit quietly, keeping the head higher 
than the level of the heart; that is, sit up or lie with 
the head elevated. Do not lay flat or put your head between 
your legs. 5. Apply ice (crushed in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">plastic</a> bag or 
washcloth) to nose and cheeks.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
