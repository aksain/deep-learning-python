<p></p>.<p>In <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothermia_extended_exposure_to_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypothermia</a>, the body temperature is dangerously low (below 95 F or 35 C), and the body has lost capacity to regulate its temperature. The symptoms typically begin gradually, and eventually, thought process and brain function are affected. Symptoms include</p>.<p>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Mood changes</a>, irritability, poor coordination, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">confusion</a>, poor judgment, slurred speech, and gait disturbances are common. Sometimes affected people remove their clothing in spite of a cold environment (paradoxical undressing).
