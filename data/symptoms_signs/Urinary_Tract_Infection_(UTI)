<p></p>.<p>Symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infection</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">UTI</a>) are similar in men, women, and 
children. Early symptoms and signs are usually easy to recognize and primarily involve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, discomfort, or burning when trying to 
urinate. Accompanying this can be the sense that one needs to urinate urgently 
(known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_urgency/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary urgency</a>) or the need for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frequent_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">frequent urination</a> (called urinary 
frequency). Even when there is a strong urge to urinate, you may pass only a 
small amount of urine. The urine itself may appear bloody or cloudy. Men may 
feel <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> in the rectum, while women may experience pain around the pubic bone.
</p>.<p>Some people, however, may develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infections</a> without having 
these characteristic symptoms. Infants, in particular, may have nonspecific 
signs and symptoms like fussiness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, and poor feeding. Likewise, the 
elderly may not have specific symptoms, and the diagnosis may be more difficult 
in this case. In some cases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infections</a> can be present without 
causing symptoms at all. </p>.<p>In general, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> is uncommon if there is an infection of the bladder or 
urethra (lower urinary tract). Fever is more likely to accompany a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_uti_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">UTI</a> when the 
infection has spread to the kidneys or to the bloodstream.</p>.<p>
	A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection_in_adults/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">UTI</a> occurs when bacteria enter and grow in the normally sterile urinary tract. At least 90% of uncomplicated infections are caused by a type of bacteria called 
	<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Escherichia coli</a></i>, better know as <i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">E. coli</a></i>. These bacteria normally live in the bowel (colon) and around the anus and can move to the area around the urethra. Other types of bacteria can also cause 
	a UTI but less commonly.
