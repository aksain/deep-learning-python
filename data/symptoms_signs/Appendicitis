<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Abdominal pain</a> is the main symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">appendicitis</a>. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> starts out as diffuse, meaning it is difficult to localize the area of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>. Most people say the initial pain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis_appendectomy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">appendicitis</a> occurs around the middle portion of the abdomen. As the inflammation of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">appendix</a> progresses, the pain becomes localized to one area. Once the peritoneum (lining tissue of the abdomen) is inflamed, the pain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">appendicitis</a> is characteristically located at a point between the navel and the front of the right hip bone. Anatomically, this is referred to as McBurney's point.</p>.<p>
Another frequent symptom of appendicitis is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loss of appetite</a>. Over time, this can worsen, resulting in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>. Other symptoms that can occur are swelling of the abdomen, the inability to pass <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gas</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diarrhea</a> with 
gas, and a mild to moderate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>.</p>.<p>
Some people with appendicitis have atypical symptoms. They may not have the classic pain localized in the lower right abdomen. Sometimes, affected people report experiencing rectal 
or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">back pain</a>. 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burning_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Painful urination</a> has also been reported. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> may precede the onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a> in certain cases.
</p>.<p>
The cause of appendicitis is believed to be an infection of the wall of the appendix that begins with blockage (by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stool</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, or foreign body) of the opening from the appendix into the cecum of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">large intestine</a>. At other times, the lymphatic (immune response) tissues in the appendix swell and block the opening. When the blockage occurs, bacteria that are normally found within the appendix begin to grow and infect the wall of the appendix, leading to inflammation.
