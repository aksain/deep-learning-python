Symptoms can include intense focus on one item, unresponsiveness, lack of understanding social cues (like tone of voice or body language), repetitive movements, or self-abusive behavior like head-banging. The severity of the symptoms varies widely among affected individuals. Other possible symptoms include learning to speak relatively late, not playing interactively with other children, avoidance of eye contact, lack of empathy, and social withdrawal. Children with ASD who have not developed sufficient language skills may act out, including screaming or crying, to express their needs. It is important to note that people with ASD may vary widely in their level of functioning, and not all people with ASD will experience all of the symptoms listed.</p>.<p>

<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> published by the American Psychiatric Association. In the most recent version of this diagnostic guide, Asperger syndrome has been removed as a formal diagnosis; those with the symptoms of what was formerly referred to as Asperger syndrome are now grouped in the category of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> spectrum disorder.</p>.<p>
The exact cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a> spectrum disorder is not known, but it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.
