<p></p>.<p>Numbness of the toes generally is a result of conditions that affect the nerves and/or blood vessels that supply the foot. Numbness of the toes is often associated with tingling. Numbness and tingling sensations in the toes is referred to as paresthesia of the toes.</p>.<p> 
The most common cause of toe numbness is direct compression of the nerves of the foot from footwear 
from shoes. Numbness of the toe can occur because of injury to the foot, nerve damage (neuropathy), and poor circulation to the foot (such as with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peripheral_vascular_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">peripheral vascular disease</a>). Numbness to the foot can also be caused by irritation of nerves in the low back with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiculopathy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiculopathy</a> and
