The symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> vary depending upon the area of the brain affected by a lack of oxygen. All <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">strokes</a> involve symptoms that relate to impairment of nerve function. The symptoms typically arise suddenly and most commonly occur on one side of the body. Symptoms and signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> can include numbness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a>, tingling, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vision_loss/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vision loss</a> or changes. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/confusion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Confusion</a>, changes in the level of consciousness, trouble speaking, trouble understanding speech, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vertigo_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vertigo</a>, and balance problems are other common symptoms. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> sometimes accompany a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, particularly when the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/11_signs_and_symptoms_of_stroke/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> involves bleeding inside the brain.

Stroke is caused by an interruption of blood flow to a specific area of the brain. This means that the brain cells in the involved artery do not receive an adequate supply of oxygen carried from the bloodstream. Damage to the brain cells due to the lack of oxygen causes a stroke. Strokes can be ischemic (due to a blocked artery or interruption of blood flow) or 
hemorrhagic (the area of the brain bleeds due to a bursting or leaking blood vessel). In either case, there is insufficient oxygen for the brain to function.
