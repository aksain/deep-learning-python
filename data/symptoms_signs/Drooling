Drooling is the unintentional spillage of saliva from the mouth. Drooling can occur with any condition that impairs neuromuscular control of the muscles around the mouth, leading to weak muscles around the mouth, that increases salivation (the production of saliva), or that impairs swallowing. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cerebral_palsy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cerebral palsy</a> is one example of a condition in which oral neuromuscular control may be impaired, resulting in drooling. Other medical conditions that may cause drooling because of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swallowing/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">swallowing problems</a> include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/down_syndrome_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Down syndrome</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">autism</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">ALS</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a>.</p>.<p>
Drooling is common in infants because of immature muscular control. Medically, drooling is referred to as ptyalism, and an excess of saliva is known as sialorrhea. Conditions that lead to overproduction of saliva may sometimes lead to drooling.
