A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/subconjunctival_hemorrhage/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">subconjunctival hemorrhage</a> is painless bleeding that appears as a bright red or dark red patch on the sclera (the white portion of the eye). Since there is no <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or discomfort associated with the bleeding, these may be first apparent when looking in the mirror or may be first noticed by another person. The red patch of visible bleeding is typically the only 
sign or symptom.</p>.<p> 
A subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">conjunctiva</a>) is caused by the rupture of one of the small  blood vessels in the conjunctiva, the lining tissue of the eye. Most subconjunctival hemorrhages occur without an obvious cause for the bleeding. Certain conditions can occasionally result in a spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sneezing</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">coughing</a>, straining, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, eye rubbing, or inserting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contact_lenses_colored_soft_hard_toric_and_bifoc/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contact lenses</a>. Increasing pressure in the veins of the head (such as when lying on an inversion table or weightlifting) can increase the risk for subconjunctival hemorrhage. Other causes can include infections of the conjunctiva or medical conditions that cause bleeding or prevent normal blood clotting. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Trauma</a> to the head or eye can also result in subconjunctival hemorrhage.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>
