<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sinus infection</a> is characterized by an infection of the lining tissues of the 
sinuses within the skull. The resulting inflammation leads to blockage of the openings that allow drainage of fluid from the sinus. Early symptoms and signs of a sinus infection are often related to the respiratory infection (such as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cold</a>) that led to the inflammation of the sinus tissues. Symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or pressure sensations over the involved areas of the face along with facial tenderness and swelling. Stuffy nose, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nasal_congestion/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nasal congestion</a>, can occur as well as drainage or discharge from the nose. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cough</a> may be present, and sometimes patients have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>.</p>.<p>
Other symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/earache/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">earache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> in the jaw or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/habits_that_wreck_your_teeth_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">teeth</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sore throat</a>, and a decrease in the sense of smell. Discharge (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/postnasal_drip_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">postnasal drip</a>) may be present in the back of the throat that produces <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cold_flu_cough_relief_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cough</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bad_breath/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bad breath</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sneezing/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Sneezing</a>, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, visual disturbances, and a feeling of fullness in the ears can accompany a sinus infection.</p>.<p>
A sinus infection occurs when the sinuses become blocked and fluid is unable to drain from the sinuses. In this environment, bacteria or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> (rarely, fungi) can proliferate and cause an infection. Conditions that can cause sinus blockage and lead to sinus infection include the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">common cold</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nasal polyps</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergic rhinitis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hay fever</a>), or a deviated nasal septum.
