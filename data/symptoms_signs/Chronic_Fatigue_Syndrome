The diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_fatigue_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chronic fatigue syndrome</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_fatigue_syndrome/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">CFS</a>) means that the sufferer has experienced <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> for at least six months in the absence of known medical causes as well as had other characteristic symptoms. 
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee recommends the name systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) for this disease, and it has also been referred to as myalgic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">encephalomyelitis</a> (ME), even though no evidence of inflammation of the brain (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">encephalitis</a>) has been demonstrated with this condition.</p>.<p>
Characteristic symptoms in addition to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>  include</p>.<p>
 Other signs and symptoms may also be present, like</p>.<p>
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dizziness</a>, balance problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fainting</a>, food sensitivities, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/night_sweats/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">night sweats</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chills</a>, vision disturbances, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mood changes</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a> have also been reported. The symptoms can be generalized and may occur due to many different causes; therefore, the diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_fatigue_syndrome_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chronic fatigue syndrome</a> relies upon excluding other medical causes of the symptoms.</p>.<p>
The exact cause of CFS or SEID is not known. There are no proven links to any known disease infection that is responsible for CFS or SEID development.
Researchers are still trying to identify the cause(s) of CFS/SEID suggest the possibility that CFS/SEID represents an endpoint of multiple diseases or conditions such as viral infections, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, and toxin exposure. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that "CFS is not caused exclusively by any single recognized infectious disease agent." This includes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/epstein-barr_virus_ebv/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Epstein-Barr virus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Lyme disease</a> bacteria (<i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>), human retroviruses, 
<i>Mycoplasma</i>, and many others. Some researchers have suggested that a new virus found in some CFS/SEID patients (termed XMRV or xenotropic murine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">leukemia</a> virus-related virus) may be a candidate for cause, but a larger study failed to prove this theory.
