<p></p>.<p>The symptom of joint cracking is described differently by different people while nevertheless representing the same condition. Various descriptions for the same process include "popping," "exploding," "noise," "snapping," and "creaking" of a joint. The cause of joint cracking depends on a number of conditions.

Such causes of joint popping include ligament strain or ligament tear, tendon strain or tendon tear (tendon rupture), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">broken bone</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fracture</a>), and 
joint dislocation.  </p>.<p>Joint popping that occurs repeatedly, sometimes intentionally, can be caused by harmless events, such as knuckle cracking or snapping of a tendon over a protruding bony prominence. Repeated joint popping can also be caused by conditions that represent more serious joint status, such as a cartilage tear from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/torn_meniscus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">torn meniscus</a> or degenerated cartilage from
