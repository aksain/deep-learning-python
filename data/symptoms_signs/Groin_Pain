The groin area is the area where the upper thigh meets the lower abdomen. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pain</a> in the groin area arises from conditions affecting a variety of organs, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management_musculoskeletal_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">musculoskeletal pain</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> related to the male reproductive organs. Groin pain can be acute (sudden in onset), or the pain can persist over time (chronic), depending on the specific cause. As with any pain, the characteristics of groin pain 
-- its precise location, timing, duration, etc. -- are important to determine the cause. Groin pain can arise due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> or injury, tumors, infections, hernias, or other conditions. Pain in the groin can also originate in areas other than the groin, such as the leg. This is known as radiating or referred pain. For example, injury to the muscles or tendons in the leg can cause radiating pain to the groin area.</p>.<p>
