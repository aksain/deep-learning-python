An inverted <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nipple</a> is a condition in which the nipple is pulled inward into the breast instead of pointing outward. 
This condition can also be called nipple inversion, nipple retraction, or invaginated nipple, although some observers distinguish these two variations. Nipple retraction can be a congenital (present at birth) condition as a normal variant in some women. In other cases, it may arise as a result of disease or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a>. Any condition that causes inflammation or scarring of the tissues behind the nipple may cause the nipple to pull inward.
