<i>Candida albicans</i> is the yeast that typically causes oral thrush. Certain factors can predispose 
someone to developing the illness, including illness, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>, medications, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dentures/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dentures</a>. It is more likely to develop in people who have suppressed immune function, such as people receiving <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chemotherapy</a> or those with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HIV/AIDS</a>. Medications like antibiotics or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corticosteroids</a> that upset the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth may also predispose a person to developing oral thrush.
