The normal brown color of stool occurs due to the presence of bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as a breakdown product of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemoglobin</a> (from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">red blood cells</a>) in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">liver</a> and is secreted into the bile, which enters the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">intestines</a>. If the intestinal contents travel at a normal speed, chemical changes in bilirubin produce stool that is light to dark brown. The stool may appear green if the intestinal contents pass through the bowel more rapidly.</p>.<p>
Changes in the color of stool are common and are generally not significant if the changes are noted from one stool to the next and are not persistent. However, changes in the color of stool can also be caused by a number of minor to serious medical conditions and can occur with certain medications. Changes in stool color that are persistent and do not occur in only one stool may signal the presence of a medical condition and should be evaluated.</p>.<p>
Certain persistent changes in stool color are characteristic for specific conditions:</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
