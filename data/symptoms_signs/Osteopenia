<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteopenia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Osteopenia</a> is a bone condition characterized by a decreased density of bone, but the density is not decreased enough to warrant a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>. Osteopenia leads to bone weakening and an increased risk of breaking a bone (fracture). Osteopenia represents a lesser degree of bone loss than <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">osteoporosis</a>. When there are other risk factors present (like corticosteroid medication use, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, or other bone conditions) that also increase the risk of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bone fractures</a>, medications may be required.

Osteopenia can be related to a genetic predisposition to early bone loss. It can also occur due to hormonal factors, such as decreased estrogen levels after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>, immobility, certain medications, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, excess alcohol consumption, and certain medical conditions including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/celiac_disease_gluten_enteropathy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">celiac disease</a>. Osteopenia does not cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> or other symptoms unless a bone is broken.
