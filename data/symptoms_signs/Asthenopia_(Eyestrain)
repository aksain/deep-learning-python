Eyestrain is not a disease but a symptom that occurs when the eyes are used for a long period of time. The medical term for eyestrain is
<i>asthenopia</i>. In people who suffer from eyestrain, a lack of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>, certain medications, physical or emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, or being tired can make the symptoms worse.</p>.<p>
Eyestrain occurs after extended or prolonged use of the eyes. Reading, computer work, or looking at digital screens, straining to see in dim light, and driving long distances are examples of activities that can result in eyestrain. Refractive errors (vision problems caused by a need to wear glasses) can also cause the symptoms of eyestrain.
