<p></p>.<p>An enlarged heart is medically known as cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly can be 
caused by a number of different conditions, including diseases of the heart 
muscle or heart valves, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>, arrhythmias, and 
pulmonary 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a>. Cardiomegaly can also sometimes accompany longstanding <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anemia</a> and 
thyroid diseases, among other conditions. So-called infiltrative diseases of the heart, 
for example, in which abnormal proteins (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amyloidosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">amyloidosis</a>) or excess iron 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/iron_overload/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hemochromatosis</a>) accumulate within the tissues of the heart, can also cause an 
enlargement of the heart. Infections, nutritional deficiencies, toxins (such as 
alcohol or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drugs</a>), and some medications have been associated with cardiomegaly. 
In some situations (for example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pregnancy</a>), there can be a temporary increased 
demand on the heart, resulting in some temporary enlargement. </p>.<p>It is important to remember that an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">enlarged heart</a> is not a disease itself 
but a physical sign that can accompany many diseases and conditions. Not all of 
the associated conditions listed below, however, will always result in 
cardiomegaly. Treatment and prognosis are dependent upon the underlying cause. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pericardial effusion</a> is the accumulation of fluid in the sac surrounding the heart, which can lead to the appearance of an enlarged heart.
</p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cardiomyopathy_hypertrophic/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Cardiomyopathy</a> is a related term that refers to damage to the heart muscle. 
Cardiomyopathies are often accompanied by cardiomegaly.</p>.<p>
Symptoms of cardiomegaly depend on the cause. Sometimes, cardiomegaly may not cause symptoms. In other cases it can cause signs and symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">edema</a> (water retention) with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight gain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arrhythmia_irregular_heartbeat/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arrhythmia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/palpitations_overview/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">palpitations</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tiredness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">chest pain</a>.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
