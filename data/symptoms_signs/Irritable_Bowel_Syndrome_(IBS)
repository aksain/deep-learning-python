<p></p>.<p>The main symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</a> are</p>.<p>The change in bowel habits may result in having too frequent stools or having bowel movements less often than usual. The consistency of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stool</a> may be different than usual; it may be watery, or it may be harder or more lumpy than usual. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diarrhea</a> (having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loose stools</a> 
three or more times a day, accompanied by a sense of urgency) can be a symptom of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibs_pictures_slideshow_understanding_ibs/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">IBS</a>. Likewise, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> (straining to have a bowel movement or having less than 
three stools per week) may also occur.

The exact cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">irritable bowel syndrome</a> is unknown. It is believed to be due to a number of factors, including changes in gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility, abnormal nervous system signals, heightened sensitivity to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, and food intolerances. Many people with IBS suffer from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, but these conditions have not been shown to cause IBS. A hereditary (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">inherited</a>) cause for IBS has not been proven.
