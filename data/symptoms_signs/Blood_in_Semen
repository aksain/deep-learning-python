Blood in semen can be caused by many conditions affecting the tubes that 
distribute semen from the testicles (seminal vesicles) or the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/prostate_gland_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">prostate gland</a>.

or prostate gland. Blood in the semen can temporarily be caused by injury to the 
prostate gland, such as from prostate biopsy.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
