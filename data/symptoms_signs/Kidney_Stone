A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney stone</a> does not usually cause symptoms when it remains in the kidney. However, when a stone moves from the kidney into the ureter, it can cause a blockage of flow of urine, increasing pressure and swelling within the kidney and leading to the symptoms of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney stones</a>.</p>.<p>
Severe, often excruciating, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> is the hallmark symptom of kidney stones. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> is located in the flank or 
low back and can radiate to the front of the abdomen. It can cause scrotal or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/testicular_disorders/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">testicular pain</a> in males. The pain is referred to as renal colic and typically occurs in intermittent waves. Associated symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sweating</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>. Sometimes, blood can be seen in the urine.  If an associated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infection</a> is present, symptoms like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/difficulty_urinating/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">difficulty urinating</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burning_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">painful urination</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_urgency/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary urgency</a> can develop.</p>.<p>
The cause of kidneys stones can vary depending on the type of stone that forms. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dehydration</a> from reduced fluid intake or strenuous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> without adequate fluid replacement increases the risk of kidney stones. Obstruction to urine outflow can also lead to stone formation. Uric acid kidney stones can occur due to elevated uric acid levels in their blood (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperuricemia</a>). Certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">urinary tract infections</a> can increase the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stone_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">kidney stone</a> formation. These are known as struvite or infection stones. Other metabolic conditions (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">gout</a>) and certain medications can also increase the risk.
