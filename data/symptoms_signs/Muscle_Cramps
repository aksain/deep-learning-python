Normal movement involves alternation of contraction and relaxation of the muscles of the body. Muscles that stabilize the body, like those of the head, trunk, and neck, work similarly. When a muscle contracts involuntarily, it is referred to as a spasm; a forceful and prolonged spasm becomes a cramp.</p>.<p>Symptoms of a muscle cramp include local <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> at the site of the cramp, which can be severe, and firmness or tenderness of the involved muscle. Any muscle can develop a cramp, but the most common sites for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">muscle cramps</a> are in the legs.
