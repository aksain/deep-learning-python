In its early stages, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cervical cancer</a> typically does not cause symptoms. It may be detected on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pap_smear/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Pap screening</a> and subsequent testing even before symptoms have developed. When symptoms do occur, one of the most common symptoms is abnormal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal bleeding</a>. This can include bleeding between menstrual periods, bleeding after sexual intercourse or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_exam/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pelvic exam</a>, or bleeding after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_douche_douching/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">douching</a>. Unusual or unexplained changes in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menstrual cycle</a>, such as abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">menopause</a>, are also possible signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cervical cancer</a>.</p>.<p> 
Other symptoms and signs that may accompany the condition include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vaginal discharge</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_pain_in_women_and_men/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pelvic pain</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> during sexual intercourse. When cervical cancer has spread throughout the body (metastasized), it may cause general symptoms 
and signs, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weight loss</a>.

Infection with certain types of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">human papillomaviruses</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a>) has been found to cause cervical cancer, although it is poorly understood why only some women with this infection develop the disease, since <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/genital_warts_hpv_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">HPV</a> infection is very common. Risk factors that increase the risk of developing cervical cancer include having many sexual partners, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">smoking</a>, using <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oral_contraceptives_birth_control_pills/article.htm" rel="pharm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">birth control pills</a>, and engaging in early sexual contact (having sex at an early age).</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>
