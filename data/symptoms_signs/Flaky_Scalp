<p></p>.<p>The loss of skin cells from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_and_scalp_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">scalp</a> is a normal part 
of the life cycle of skin cells. However, excessive flaking of the scalp, or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seborrhea/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dandruff</a>, is a common cosmetic problem experienced by millions of people. 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dandruff_seborrhea_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Dandruff</a> is not <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">contagious</a> and is normally not a serious problem. Some cases of 
excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/dandruff_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dandruff</a> accompanied by intense <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itching</a> and patches of flaky skin on the 
face or elsewhere are actually a form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eczema</a> referred to as seborrheic 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_atopic_dermatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eczema</a>. </p>.<p>Dandruff is believed to be related to a fungus known as <i>malassezia</i> (formerly termed 
<i>pityrosporum</i>) that lives on the scalp of most people. 
In some cases, overgrowth of the fungus results in the flakiness of the skin 
characteristic of dandruff. The reasons for the overgrowth of fungus are unclear 
but may be related to increased oil production, hormonal changes, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, 
neurologic disorders such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a>, recovery from chronic 
conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart attack</a>, suppression of the immune system, and infrequent shampooing. There is also some evidence that dandruff 
may run in families. Scalp flakiness may also be caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">psoriasis</a> or other skin ailments or infections.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
