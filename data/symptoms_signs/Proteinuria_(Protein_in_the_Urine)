Proteinuria refers to excess protein in the urine. While some amount of protein in the urine is normal, excessive amounts of protein in the urine are a sign that the kidneys are not working properly due to a number of different reasons. The main protein in the blood is albumin, and this is also the main protein in urine. For this reason, proteinuria is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">albuminuria</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hypertension</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">high blood pressure</a>) are two chronic conditions that can cause kidney damage over time, leading to excess protein in the urine. Acute (sudden onset) problems with the kidneys, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">acute renal failure</a>, also cause proteinuria. Some conditions can transiently increase the amount of protein in the urine, including emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a>, vigorous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a>, or exposure to heat or cold extreme temperatures.
