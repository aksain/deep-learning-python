<p></p>.<p>The eye is the organ of sight. Eye pain can be cause by 
conditions involving the eyeball (orbit) or be caused by conditions of structures around the eye.
</p>.<p>The eye has a number of components. These components 
include but are not limited to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cornea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">iris</a>, pupil, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/eye_anatomy_detail_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lens</a>, retina, macula, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">optic nerve</a>, choroid and vitreous.</p>.<p><img width="267" height="251" alt="diagram of the eye" hspace="5" src="https://images.medicinenet.com/images/eyestruc.gif" align="right"></p>.<p>The cornea is the clear front window of the eye that
transmits and focuses light into the eye.</p>.<p>The iris is the colored part of the eye that helps regulate the amount of light that enters the eye.</p>.<p>The pupil is the dark aperture in the iris that determines how much light is let into the eye.</p>.<p>The lens is the transparent structure inside the eye that
focuses light rays onto the retina.</p>.<p>The retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of the 
eye, senses light and creates impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain.</p>.<p>The macula is a small area in the retina that contains
special light-sensitive cells and allows us to see fine details
clearly.</p>.<p>The optic nerve is the nerve that connects the eye to 
the brain and carries the impulses formed by the retina to the visual cortex of the brain.</p>.<p>The choroid is a thin vascular layer between the sclera 
 and the retina that supplies blood to the retina and conducts arteries and nerves to other structures in the eye.</p>.<p>The vitreous humor is a clear, jelly-like substance that
fills the middle of the eye.</p>.<p>
Diseases and conditions that involve any of the above structures of the eye, as well as tissues around the eye, can cause eye <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>.  </p>.<p>Medical terms for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> in the eye are 
<i>ophthalmalgia</i> and 
<i>ophthalmodynia</i>.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
