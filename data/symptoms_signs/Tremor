They are referred to as rest tremors. The classic rest <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tremor</a> is from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Parkinson's disease</a>. Some tremors are most apparent as the extremity is lifted against gravity and not moving toward a target (for example, from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hyperthyroidism</a>, familial, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> fear). These tremors are referred to as positional or postural tremors. Some tremors are more prominent with movement actions toward a target and are referred to as intention tremors. This is what occurs with disease or damage to the cerebellum of the brain. </p>.<p>A neurologist is a specialist expert in evaluating tremors.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>.
