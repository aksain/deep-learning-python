Shoulder pain can be a result of injury or disease of the shoulder joint. Injury can affect any of the ligaments, bursae, or tendons surrounding the shoulder joint. Injury can also affect the ligaments, cartilage, menisci (plural for meniscus), and bones of the joint. The design of the shoulder joint is such that it sacrifices stability for mobility. As an extremely mobile joint that plays a central role in the action of a major extremity, the shoulder is at risk for injury. Common injuries of the shoulder can lead to inflammation of the bursae (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bursitis</a>) or tendons (tendonitis or tendinitis) and result in 
a torn <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rotator_cuff/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rotator cuff</a> with dysfunction, impingement, as well as instability and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frozen_shoulder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">frozen shoulder</a>. Labral tears can be from torn cartilage.
