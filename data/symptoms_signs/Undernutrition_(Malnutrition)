Malnutrition is the lack of adequate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nutrition</a>, either as a result of imbalances, deficiencies, or excesses in a person's intake of food and nutrients. This can be due to eating too little, eating an improper <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>, or having a medical condition that results in the body's being unable to use food and nutrients. Malnutrition can also refer to overnutrition and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">obesity</a> and is the condition of being poorly nourished.</p>.<p>
In cases of undernutrition, children may show slow growth, failure to thrive, developmental delays, behavioral changes 
(including decreased attention), and muscle wasting. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Tiredness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>, slow <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">wound</a> healing, and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loss of appetite</a> may occur.

Poor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nutrition</a> is often caused by a combination of economic and social issues. Those affected by poverty or social isolation are at risk. Certain health problems, like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dementia</a>, and chronic illness may reduce an older person's appetite and desire to eat, resulting in compromised nutrition. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Alcoholism</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drug abuse</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_illness/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">mental illness</a> can all interfere with a person's ability to consume an adequate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">diet</a>.</p>.<p>
Some people with low incomes cannot afford (or access) enough nutritious foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, protein, and milk.  Foods and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drinks_and_beverages_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">drinks</a> high in fat, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sugar</a>, and salt are readily available and inexpensive, so people may turn to these as a substitute for proper nutrition. This practice has led to an increase in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">overweight</a> and obesity, which are also forms of malnutrition.
