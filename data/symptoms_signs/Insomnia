<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Insomnia</a> is the perception of inadequate or poor-quality 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. It can be due to 
problems falling asleep, early wakening, waking frequently during the night, 
unrefreshing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>, or a combination of these. Contrary to some popular beliefs, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_tips_avoid_insomnia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">insomnia</a> is not defined by the total amount of sleep one gets or how long it 
takes a person to fall asleep. Individuals can vary in their need for sleep, and 
in the time required to fall asleep. What is a refreshing night's sleep for one 
person might be insomnia for another person.</p>.<p>Insomnia may be classified by how long the symptoms are present. Temporary 
insomnia (transient insomnia) 
usually is due to situational changes, such as travel and stressful events. It 
lasts for less than a week or until the stressful event is resolved. Short-term insomnia lasts for 
one to three weeks, and 
long-term insomnia (chronic insomnia) 
continues for more than three weeks. Insomnia may also be classified as primary or 
secondary. Primary insomnia occurs in the absence of other medical problems, 
while secondary insomnia occurs as a result of a medical condition such as 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heart 
disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cancer</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn_reflux/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">heartburn</a> 
causing wakefulness. </p>.<p>Insomnia is more likely to occur in females, people over 
60 years of age, and people who have a history of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">depression</a>, however, anyone 
can be affected by insomnia. Short-term insomnia may also occur as a side effect 
of certain medications. Chronic insomnia is more serious and may be caused or worsened by a 
variety of mental and physical problems. </p>.<p>Although sedative medications may be prescribed by a 
doctor for severe cases of insomnia, their use is controversial in management of 
long-term insomnia. Many treatments for insomnia are behavioral in nature; for example, identifying 
and reducing behaviors that worsen the insomnia or learning and practicing 
relaxation techniques. Insomnia can be particularly devastating because it often 
leads to a "vicious cycle" of daytime behaviors that worsen the condition. 
Persons without adequate sleep can experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tiredness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lack of energy</a>, and 
concentration problems; which they may attempt to overcome by excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">caffeine</a> 
intake or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nicotine/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nicotine</a> use. Insomniacs may be "too tired" to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">exercise</a> and take 
afternoon naps, both of which reduce the ability to fall asleep the following 
night. </p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
