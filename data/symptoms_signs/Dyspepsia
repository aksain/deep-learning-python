<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">belching</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> (with or without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>), 
abdominal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bloating</a> (the sensation of abdominal fullness without objective distention), early satiety (the sensation of fullness after a very small amount of food), and, possibly, abdominal distention (swelling). Symptoms of dyspepsia originate from the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily the stomach and first part of the small intestine. 
The symptoms most often are provoked by eating, which is a time when many different gastrointestinal functions are called upon to work in concert. If function is not normal, the symptoms of dyspepsia occur.
