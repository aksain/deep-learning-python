<p></p>.<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/snoring/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Snoring</a> is a sound resulting from turbulent airflow that 
causes the tissues of the nose and throat to vibrate during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sleep</a>. The turbulent 
air flow is related to a narrowing at some point in the nose, mouth, or throat. Different 
people who snore may have various reasons for the narrowing of the air spaces 
leading to snoring. </p>.<p>Any person can snore, and studies estimate that 45% of men and 30% of women 
snore on a regular basis. People who snore can have any body type, although as a 
rule, snoring increases when people 
gain weight. Sleeping position may also 
affect snoring. Since the tissues of the pharynx are normally soft and floppy, 
when we lie on our backs, gravity pulls the palate, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adenoids_and_tonsils/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tonsils</a>, and tongue backward. This 
often narrows the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/airway_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">airway</a> enough to cause turbulence in airflow, tissue 
 vibration, and snoring. </p>.<p>Anatomical variation, the use of medications and 
alcohol, and underlying medical conditions are all among the various causes of 
snoring. The normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" rel="sub" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">aging</a> 
process also leads to relaxation of the throat muscles and can facilitate 
snoring.</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
