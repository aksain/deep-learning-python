<p></p>.<p>Dengue infection is a leading cause of death and sickness in tropical and 
subtropical parts of the world. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more serious form of dengue infection.</p>.<p>
Primary symptoms of dengue appear three to 15 days after the mosquito bite and include high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fever</a> and severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">headache</a>, with severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a> behind the eyes that is apparent when trying to move the eyes. Other associated symptoms are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_pain/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">joint pain</a>, muscle and bone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">rash</a>, and mild bleeding. Many affected people complain of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">low back pain</a>. The 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lymph_nodes_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymph nodes</a> of the neck and groin may be swollen. Young children and people infected for the first time typically have milder symptoms than older children and adults.</p>.<p>
Dengue hemorrhagic fever starts with the typical signs and symptoms of dengue as described above. The fever lasts from 
two to seven days. After the fever begins to abate, symptoms occur that are related to increased permeability of the capillary blood vessels. These symptoms can include severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">abdominal pain</a>, prolonged <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a> problems. Bleeding tendencies, including easy 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bruises/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bruising</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nosebleed/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nosebleeds</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bleeding_gums/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">bleeding gums</a>, skin hemorrhages, and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/internal_bleeding/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">internal bleeding</a> may occur. The disease may progress to failure of the circulatory system, leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shock</a> and death.

Dengue is caused by one of four dengue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">viruses</a> (dengue virus types 1-4 or DENV 1-4) that are transmitted by the bite of an infected 
<i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito that has previously bitten an infected person. In the Western Hemisphere, the 
<i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito is the most common transmitter of dengue infection; transmission by the 
<i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquito bite has also been reported.
