Tearing is a normal function of the eye. Excessive tearing, or teary eyes that are not from normal crying, can be a sign of an underlying health condition or disease. The tears of the eye come from the tear gland, called the lacrimal gland, which is located above the outer eye. Tears are composed of water, oil, and antibodies. The moisture from tears on the front of the eye, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">cornea</a>, is essential to prevent damage to the cornea from drying and becoming inflamed (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/keratitis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">keratitis</a>) leading to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corneal abrasion</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corneal_ulcer/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">corneal ulcer</a>.</p>.<p>
The tears drain from the eye through the tear ducts (lacrimal ducts) into the nose. If the tear ducts become blocked, tears can well up in the eye and fall excessively. This leads to watery eye (epiphora), often mistaken for crying. Tear ducts can become blocked from infection and inflammation, both of which can also lead to excessive tear production. Blockage of the tear ducts can also occur from diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sarcoidosis/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">sarcoidosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lymphoma</a>, IgG related disease, as well as from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">trauma</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" rel="proc" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">radiation</a> treatments.</p>.<p> 
The outer membrane of the eye is called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">conjunctiva</a>. Any irritation of the cornea or conjunctiva can lead to watery eye. Inflammation of the conjunctiva from (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">conjunctivitis</a>) infection, irritants (chemical splash, etc.), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">allergy</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hay_fever/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">hay fever</a>) is a common cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">itchy</a>, watery eyes, as well as eye swelling. Infection of the eye can require antibiotics in the form of prescription eyedrops. Regular use of 
over-the-counter eyedrops (artificial tears) can be very beneficial for treating chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eyes/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dry eyes</a>, such as from 
Sj√∂gren's syndrome or with facial nerve palsy (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/facial_nerve_problems/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Bell's palsy</a>) and inability to close the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">eyelid</a>.
