<p></p>.<p>Depigmentation of the skin can be caused by a number of 
local and systemic conditions. The pigment loss can be partial (such as after 
injury to the skin) or complete (such as from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vitiligo/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vitiligo</a>). It can be temporary 
(such as from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tinea_versicolor/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">tinea versicolor</a>) or permanent (such as from albinism).
