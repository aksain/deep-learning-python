consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and ones 
surroundings. When the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">loss of consciousness</a> is temporary and there 
is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in 
nonmedical terms, fainting. Syncope accounts for one in every 30 
visits to an emergency room. It is pronounced sin-ko-pea.
</p>.<p>Syncope is due to a temporary reduction in blood flow 
and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lightheadedness</a> 
or a "black out" episode, a loss of consciousness. Temporary impairment of the 
blood supply to the brain can be caused by heart conditions and by conditions 
that do not directly involve the heart.
