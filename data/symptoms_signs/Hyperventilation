<p></p>.<p>Hyperventilation refers to overbreathing, in which 
ventilation exceeds the 
 metabolic demand, and 
its related physiological consequences. Excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">breathing</a> can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">lightheadedness</a>, 
 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">weakness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shortness_of_breath/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">shortness of breath</a>, a sense of unsteadiness, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">muscle 
spasms</a> in the hands and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" rel="quiz" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">feet</a>, and a tingling feeling around the mouth and fingertips. All of these symptoms are the result of 
abnormally low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood caused by overbreathing.
</p>.<p>The term hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) is sometimes used to describe the 
effects of hyperventilation observed in an emergency department setting. Many 
 acute (sudden onset) 
cases of hyperventilation arise from 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/panic_disorder/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">panic</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">anxiety</a>, and other emotional 
conditions. Hyperventilation, particularly chronic hyperventilation (that 
persists over time), can also be due to a range of 
medical conditions. </p>.<p>The opposite of hyperventilation is termed hypoventilation 
(underventilation).</p>.<p class="credits">REFERENCE:<br><br>Kasper, D.L., et al., eds. <i>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th Ed</i>. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.</p>
